TI  - Does the SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive dimension identify cognitive impairments?
PG  - 94-101
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relevance of the Symptom Checklist 90-R 
      Obsessive-Compulsive subscale to cognition in individuals with brain tumor. 
      DESIGN: A prospective study of patients assessed with a neuropsychological test 
      battery. SETTING: A university medical center. PATIENTS: Nineteen adults with 
      biopsy-confirmed diagnoses of malignant brain tumors were assessed prior to 
      aggressive chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Included in the assessment were 
      the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, California Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making 
      Test B, Symptom Checklist 90-R, Mood Assessment Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, 
      and Chronic Illness Problem Inventory. RESULTS: The SCL 90-R Obsessive-Compulsive 
      subscale was not related to objective measures of attention, verbal memory, or 
      age. It was related significantly to symptoms of depression (r = .81, P < .005), 
      anxiety (r = .66, P < .005), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = 
      .75, P < .005). Multivariate analyses indicated that reported symptoms of 
      depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R 
      Obsessive-Compulsive Scores, whereas symptoms of anxiety contributed an 
      additional 6% (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the SCL 90-R is 
      best viewed as an indicator of unidimensional emotional distress and somatic 
      effects of structural brain injury.
