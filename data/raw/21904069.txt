TI  - Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. 
      Should one rely on the short gastric arteries?
PG  - 445-57
AB  - CONTEXT: Knowing the collaterals is essential for a spleen-preserving distal 
      pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the 
      sources of the blood supply to the spleen after a spleen-preserving distal 
      pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. METHODS: Perfusion of the 
      cadaveric left gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries with methylene blue 
      after occlusion of all the arteries except the short gastric arteries (n=10). 
      Intraoperative color Doppler ultrasound was used for the evaluation of the hilar 
      arterial blood flow at distal pancreatectomy (n=23) after 1) clamping of the 
      splenic artery alone, 2) clamping of the splenic and left gastroepiploic arteries 
      and 3) clamping of the splenic and short gastric arteries. CT angiography of the 
      gastric and splenic vessels before and after a spleen-preserving distal 
      pancreatectomy (n=10). RESULTS: Perfusion of the cadaveric arteries revealed no 
      effective direct or indirect (through the submucous gastric arterial network) 
      communication between the left gastric and the branches of the short gastric 
      arteries. In no case did intraoperative color Doppler ultrasound detect any hilar 
      arterial blood flow after the clamping of the splenic and left gastroepiploic 
      arteries. The clamping of the short gastric arteries did not change the flow 
      parameters. In none of the cases did a post-spleen-preserving distal 
      pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels CT angiography delineate the 
      short gastric vessels supplying the spleen. In all cases, the gastroepiploic 
      arcade was the main arterial pathway feeding the spleen. CONCLUSION: 
      Experimental, intra- and postoperative instrumental investigations did not show 
      the short gastric arteries to be engaged in the blood supply to the spleen after 
      a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. 
      In all cases, the left gastroepiploic artery was the main collateral vessel.
