TI  - Is late-night salivary cortisol a better screening test for possible cortisol 
      excess than standard screening tests in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes?
PG  - 47-58
AB  - AIM: To compare the performance, in terms of specificity for cortisol excess, of 
      late-night salivary cortisol with 24-hour urine-free cortisol (24hr UFC) and 
      overnight 1mg dexamethasone suppression test (1mg DST) in a group of obese T2DM 
      patients. METHODS: Forty obese patients with T2DM without clinical features of 
      Cushing's syndrome were recruited. Plasma, urinary and salivary cortisol were 
      measured directly by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using monoclonal 
      antibodies. The specificities of the three tests using various cutoffs were 
      calculated and compared, employing the assumption that none of the patients had 
      hypercortisolism. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age and BMI of 56 years (range 
      31-75) and 37 kg/m(2) (31-56) respectively. All 40 provided late-night salivary 
      cortisol samples. Thirty-eight patients completed all three tests. Two patients 
      only completed two screening tests. The specificities of late-night salivary 
      cortisol (cutoff 10 nmol/L), 24hr UFC (400 nmol) and 1mg DST (50 nmol/L) were 70% 
      (95% CI 53-83%), 90% (76-97%) and 72% (55-85%) respectively. The specificity of 
      late-night salivary cortisol was significantly less than 24 hr UFC (P=0.039) but 
      not 1mg DST (P>0.99). CONCLUSION: Late-night salivary cortisol has a poor 
      specificity for cortisol excess in obese patients with T2DM with 24 hr UFC 
      showing significantly better specificity in our population.
