TI  - Can Flexible Instruments Create Adequate Femoral Tunnel Lengths at 90 degrees  of Knee 
      Flexion in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction?
PG  - 135-40
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to study femoral tunnel lengths drilled with a flexible 
      reamer and the distance to important lateral structures obtained by flexing the 
      knee at various angles and by drilling the guide pins arthroscopically to 
      resemble clinical practice. The purpose of this cadaveric study was twofold: 1. 
      to determine whether femoral tunnel lengths of greater than 20 mm can be created 
      with a flexible reamer system at 90  degrees  of knee flexion and 2. to determine whether 
      the lateral structures of the knee are safe with this technique. METHODS: Ten 
      fresh cadaveric knees were utilized. The intra-osseous length can be measured 
      with a specially de - signed flexible guide pin. Flexible pins were inserted with 
      the knee at 70 degrees , 90 degrees , and 120 degrees  of flexion. The intra-osseous length was measured 
      with the measuring device. Each speci - men was dissected around the lateral 
      aspect of the knee to identify the critical structures, the common peroneal 
      nerve, and the LCL. The distance from the guide pins to the com - mon peroneal 
      nerve and femoral attachment of the LCL were measured with a standard flexible 
      paper ruler to the nearest millimeter. RESULTS: There is a trend for 
      progressively increasing mean intra-osseous length associated with increased 
      flexion of the knee. The mean intra-osseous length for 70 degrees  flexion was 25.2 mm 
      (20 mm to 32 mm), which was statistically significant when compared to mean 
      intra-osseous lengths of 32.1 mm (22 mm to 45 mm) and 38.0 mm (34 mm to 45 mm) in 
      the 90 degrees  and 120 degrees  flexion groups, respectively (p < 0.05). There were no 
      significant differences among the groups with respect to distance to the LCL. 
      There is a trend toward longer distances to the common peroneal nerve with 
      increased flexion. There was a statistically significant dif - ference when 
      comparing 120 degrees  versus 70 degrees  (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study that shows that 
      adequate femoral tunnel lengths can be safely created without knee hyperflex - 
      ion using flexible instruments via an anteromedial portal.
