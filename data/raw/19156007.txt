AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) 
      possesses the essential psychometric characteristics to measure depressive 
      symptoms in people with visual impairment. METHODS: The PHQ-9 scale was completed 
      by 103 participants with low vision. These data were then assessed for fit to the 
      Rasch model. RESULTS: The participants' mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age was 
      74.7 +/- 12.2 years. Almost one half of them (n = 46; 44.7%) were considered to 
      have severe vision impairment (presenting visual acuity <6/60 in the better eye). 
      Disordered thresholds were evident initially. Collapsing the two middle 
      categories produced ordered thresholds and fit to the Rasch model (chi = 10.1; 
      degrees of freedom = 9; p = 0.34). The mean (SD) items and persons Fit Residual 
      values were -0.31 (1.12) and -0.25 (0.78), respectively, where optimal fit of 
      data to the Rasch model would have a mean = 0 and SD = 1. Unidimensionality was 
      demonstrated confirming the construct validity of the PHQ-9 and there was no 
      evidence of differential item functioning on a number of factors including visual 
      disability. The person separation reliability value was 0.80 indicating that the 
      PHQ-9 has satisfactory precision. There was a degree of mistargeting as expected 
      in this largely non-clinically depressed sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings 
      demonstrate that the PHQ-9, when scaled with Rasch analysis, forms a linear 
      interval measurement of depressive symptoms suitable for use in a vision impaired 
      population.
