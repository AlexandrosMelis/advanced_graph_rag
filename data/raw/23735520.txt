AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential prognostic value of using functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify patients with disorders of 
      consciousness, who show potential for recovery. DESIGN: Observational study. 
      SETTING: Unit for acute rehabilitation care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=22) in a 
      vegetative state (VS; n=10) and minimally conscious state (MCS; n=12) during the 
      first 200 days after the initial incident. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Further course on the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised. RESULTS: 
      Participants performed a mental imagery fMRI paradigm. They were asked to 
      alternately imagine playing tennis and navigating through their home. In 14 of 
      the 22 examined patients (VS, n=5; MCS, n=9), a significant activation of the 
      regions of interest (ROIs) of the mental imagery paradigm could be found. All 5 
      patients with activation of a significant blood oxygen level dependent signal, 
      who were in a VS at the time of the fMRI examination, reached at least an MCS at 
      the end of the observation period. In contrast, 5 participants in a VS who failed 
      to show activation in ROIs, did not (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%). Six of 
      9 patients in an MCS with activation in ROIs emerged from an MCS. Of 3 patients 
      in an MCS who did not show activation, 2 patients stayed in an MCS and 1 patient 
      emerged from the MCS (sensitivity 85%, specificity 40%). CONCLUSIONS: The fMRI 
      paradigm mental imagery displays a high concordance with the further clinical 
      course of patients in a VS. All 5 patients in a VS who showed significant 
      activation of ROIs had a favorable further course until the end of the 
      observation period. We therefore propose the term "functional minimally conscious 
      state" for these patients. They may benefit from rehabilitation treatment. In 
      cases where no significant activation was seen, the method has no prognostic 
      value. Prediction of the clinical course of patients in an MCS by fMRI was 
      considerably less accurate than in patients in a VS.
