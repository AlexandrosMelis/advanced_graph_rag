AB  - BACKGROUND: Anchoring vignettes are brief texts describing a hypothetical 
      character who illustrates a certain fixed level of a trait under evaluation. This 
      research uses vignettes to elucidate factors associated with sleep disorders in 
      adult Japanese before and after adjustment for reporting heterogeneity in 
      self-reports. This study also evaluates the need for adjusting for reporting 
      heterogeneity in the management of sleep and energy related problems in Japan. 
      METHODS: We investigated a dataset of 1002 respondents aged 18 years and over 
      from the Japanese World Health Survey, which collected information through 
      face-to-face interview from 2002 to 2003. The ordered probit model and the 
      Compound Hierarchical Ordered Probit (CHOPIT) model, which incorporated anchoring 
      vignettes, were employed to estimate and compare associations of sleep and energy 
      with socio-demographic and life-style factors before and after adjustment for 
      differences in response category cut-points for each individual. RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of self-reported problems with sleep and energy was 53 %. Without 
      correction of cut-point shifts, age, sex, and the number of comorbidities were 
      significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems. After 
      correction, age, the number of comorbidities, and regular exercise were 
      significantly associated with a greater severity of sleep-related problems; sex 
      was no longer a significant factor. Compared to the ordered probit model, the 
      CHOPIT model provided two changes with a subtle difference in the magnitude of 
      regression coefficients after correction for reporting heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: 
      Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population of Japan. Correction 
      for reporting heterogeneity using anchoring vignettes is not a necessary tool for 
      proper management of sleep and energy related problems among Japanese adults. 
      Older age, gender differences in communicating sleep-related problems, the 
      presence of multiple morbidities, and regular exercise should be the focus of 
      policies and clinical practice to improve sleep and energy management in Japan.
