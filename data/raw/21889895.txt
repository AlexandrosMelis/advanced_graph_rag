AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine if educating 
      residents about the potential effects of radiation exposure from computed 
      tomographic (CT) imaging alters ordering patterns. This study also explored 
      whether referring physicians are interested in radiation education and was an 
      initial effort to address their CT ordering behavior. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two 
      to four months after a radiologist's lecture on the potential effects of 
      radiation exposure related to CT scans, urology and orthopedic residents were 
      surveyed regarding the number and types of CT scans they ordered, the use of 
      alternative imaging modalities, and whether they used the lecture information to 
      educate patients. RESULTS: Twenty-one resident lecture attendants completed the 
      survey. The number of CT scans ordered after the lecture stayed constant for 90% 
      (19 of 21) and decreased for 10% (two of 21). The types of CT scans ordered 
      changed after the lecture for 14% (three of 21). Thirty-three percent (seven of 
      21) reported increases in alternative imaging after the lecture, including 24% 
      (five of 21) reporting increases in magnetic resonance imaging and 19% (four of 
      21) reporting increases in ultrasound. Patients directed questions about 
      radiation exposure to 57% (12 of 21); 38% (eight of 21) used the lecture 
      information to educate patients. Referring physicians were interested in the 
      topic, and afterward, other physician groups requested radiation education 
      lectures. CONCLUSIONS: Most clinicians did not change their CT scan ordering 
      after receiving education about radiation from a radiologist. Radiation education 
      allowed clinicians to discuss CT benefits and risks with their patients and to 
      choose appropriate CT protocols. Referring physician groups are interested in 
      this topic, and radiologists should be encouraged to give radiation lectures to 
      them.
