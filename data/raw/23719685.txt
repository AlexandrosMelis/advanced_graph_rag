      intradepartmental comparison of two dose regimens.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present analysis compares two palliative treatment 
      concepts for lung cancer in terms of overall survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Survival data from 207 patients were used in a retrospective analysis. All 
      patients received palliative treatment comprising either 25 Gy applied in 
      5 fractions or 50 Gy in 20 fractions. A subgroup analysis was performed to 
      compare patients with a good-fair vs. poor overall condition. RESULTS: Median 
      survival times were 21 weeks (range 6-26 weeks) for patients treated with 25 Gy 
      in 5 fractions and 23 weeks (range 14.5-31.5 weeks) for patients treated with 
      50 Gy in 20 fractions (95 % confidence interval, CI; p = 0.334). For patients 
      with a good-fair overall condition, median survival times were 30 weeks 
      (21.8-39.2 weeks) for 25 Gy in 5 fractions and 28 weeks (14.2-41.8 weeks) for 
      50 Gy in 20 fractions (CI 95 %, p = 0.694). In patients with a poor overall 
      condition, these values were 18 weeks (14.5-21.5 weeks) and 21 weeks 
      (13.0-29.0 weeks), respectively (CI 95 %, p = 0.248). CONCLUSION: The palliative 
      treatment concept of 25 Gy applied in 5 fractions is sufficient for radiation of 
      lung cancer, given that there was no obvious survival improvement in patients 
      treated with the higher total dose regimen.
