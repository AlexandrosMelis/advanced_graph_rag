TI  - Is it time to reconsider lobectomy in low-risk paediatric thyroid cancer?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Current guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy for nearly all 
      children with well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC). These guidelines, 
      however, derive from older data accrued prior to current high-resolution imaging. 
      We speculate that there is a subpopulation of children who may be adequately 
      treated with lobectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively 
      maintained database. PATIENTS: Seventy-three children with WDTC treated between 
      2004 and 2015. MEASUREMENTS: We applied two different risk-stratification 
      criteria to this population. First, we determined the number of patients meeting 
      American Thyroid Association (ATA) 'low-risk' criteria, defined as disease 
      grossly confined to the thyroid with either N0/Nx or incidental microscopic N1a 
      disease. Second, we defined a set of 'very-low-risk' histopathological criteria, 
      comprising unifocal tumours </=4 cm without predefined high-risk factors, and 
      determined the proportion of patients that met these criteria. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-seven (37%) males and 46 (63%) females were included in this study, with a 
      mean age of 13.4 years. Ipsilateral- and contralateral multifocality were 
      identified in 27 (37.0%) and 19 (26.0%) of specimens. Thirty-seven (51%) patients 
      had lymph node metastasis (N1a = 18/N1b = 19). Pre-operative ultrasound 
      identified all cases with clinically significant nodal disease. Of the 73 
      patients, 39 (53.4%) met ATA low-risk criteria and 16 (21.9%) met 'very-low-risk' 
      criteria. All 'very-low-risk' patients demonstrated excellent response to initial 
      therapy without persistence/recurrence after a mean follow-up of 36.4 months. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound and histopathology identify a substantial population that 
      may be candidates for lobectomy, avoiding the risks and potential medical and 
      psychosocial morbidity associated with total thyroidectomy. We propose a clinical 
      framework to stimulate discussion of lobectomy as an option for low-risk 
      patients.
