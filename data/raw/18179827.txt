AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether post-operative administration of topical 
      ropivacaine hydrochloride decreases morbidity following adenotonsillectomy. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: University 
      referral center; ENT Department. PARTICIPANTS: Fourty one children, aged 4-16 
      years, undergoing tonsillectomy. METHODS: Patients received 1.0% ropivacaine 
      hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae while the control 
      group received saline-soaked swabs. Mc Grath's face scale was used to compare the 
      two groups in respect of pain control. Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired 
      Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney-U-tests were used to compare the two 
      independent groups. As 10 we made 11 comparison between groups, for Bonferroni 
      correction, p<0.005 was accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: Only 
      first hour there was no significant pain-relieving effect seen in the ropivacaine 
      group (p>0.05). The other hours and days there were statistically significance 
      between the two groups (p<0.001). Also, the other post-operative parameters such 
      as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus were not 
      statistically different between the two groups. There were no complications 
      associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride. No patients in this study suffered 
      systemic side effects related to the use of this medication. CONCLUSION: Locally 
      1.0% ropivacaine administration significantly relieves the pain of pediatric 
      tonsillectomy and, it is a safe and effective method. High concentrations of 
      ropivaciane may produce clinically significant pain relief. It is more effective 
      to reduce of post-operative analgesic requirement after first hour.
