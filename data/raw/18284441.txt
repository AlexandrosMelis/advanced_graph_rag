TI  - Expression of c-kit protooncogen in hepatitis B virus-induced chronic hepatitis, 
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma: has it a diagnostic role?

AB  - AIM: There are more than 350 million people worldwide chronically infected with 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV), who are at high risk for the development of hepatitis, 
      cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because of the conflicting results 
      about c-kit expression in HCC and the key role played by c-kit in 
      gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) and other solid tumours, the aim of this 
      study was to determine c-kit expression in the course of hepatitis B infection. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissues in Cukurova University Faculty 
      of Medicine Department of Pathology between January 2002 and February 2006 were 
      searched restrospectively to investigate this issue. We performed 
      immunohistochemistry on biopsies of 125 patients with HBV infection, grouped as: 
      mild, moderate and severe hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC, 25 patients in each of 
      them, using anti c-kit monoclonal antibody. The severity of parenchymal 
      inflammation and of interface hepatitis was semiquantitatively graded on a 
      haematoxylin and eosin stained paraffin sections. Additionally, 50 more HCC, 
      formed on HBV basis, were studied to determine the prevalence of c-kit 
      overexpression. RESULTS: In cirrhotic liver, lower intensity of staining and 
      rarely c-kit positivity were present. The greatest number of the c-kit positivity 
      and higher intensity of staining was found in the livers of patients with severe 
      hepatitis and HCC. In chronic hepatitis B infection, the staining intensity was 
      parallel with the grade and stage of the disease. In the areas where fibrosis was 
      seen, c-kit positivity was rare or absent. In the HCC specimens, c-kit positivity 
      appeared both inside and around the cancerous nodes. C-kit expression was 
      observed in 62 of 75 HCC tissue specimens (82%) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: C-kit 
      positivity was observed in the mitotic, proliferating and also dysplastic hepatic 
      cells. These results suggest that c-kit expression may be used as an early 
      diagnostic indicator for HBV induced HCC.
