AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of hemodialysis (HD)-induced hypotension and 
      hypertension remains speculative. There is mounting evidence that endothelin-1 
      (ET-1) may play a vital role in these hemodynamic changes. We examined the 
      possible role of intradialytic changes of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of hypotension 
      and rebound hypertension during HD. METHODS: The present study included 45 
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on regular HD. They were divided 
      according to their hemodynamic status during HD into three groups (group I had 
      stable intradialytic hemodynamics, group II had dialysis-induced hypotension, and 
      group III had rebound hypertension during HD). In addition, 15 healthy volunteers 
      were included as a control group. Pulse and blood pressure were monitored before, 
      during (every half hour), and after HD session. ET-1 level was measured at the 
      beginning, middle, and end of HD. ET-1 was measured in the control group for 
      comparison. RESULTS: Pre-dialysis levels of ET-1 were significantly higher in 
      dialysis patients compared to the controls (P < 0.001); however, they were 
      comparable in the three HD groups. The post-dialysis ET-1 level was not changed 
      significantly in group I compared with predialysis values (14.49 +/- 2.04 vs. 
      14.33 +/- 2.23 pg/ml; P = NS), while the ET-1 concentration decreased 
      significantly in group II and increased in group III in comparison to predialysis 
      values (8.56 +/- 1.44 vs. 11.75 +/- 2.51; 16.39 +/- 3.12 vs. 11.93 +/- 2.11 
      pg/ml, respectively; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Altered ET-1 levels may be involved 
      in the pathogenesis of rebound hypertension and hypotension during HD.
