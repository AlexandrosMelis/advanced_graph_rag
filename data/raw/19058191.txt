AB  - AIMS: Quality of Life (QoL) assessment remains integral in the investigation of 
      women with lower urinary tract dysfunction. Previous work suggests that 
      physicians tend to underestimate patients' symptoms and the bother that they 
      cause. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between physician and 
      patient assessed QoL using the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ). METHODS: 
      Patients complaining of troublesome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were 
      recruited from a tertiary referral urodynamic clinic. Prior to their clinic 
      appointment they were sent a KHQ, which was completed before attending. After 
      taking a detailed urogynecological history, a second KHQ was filled in by the 
      physician, blinded to the patient responses, on the basis of their impression of 
      the symptoms elicited during the interview. These data were analyzed by an 
      independent statistician. Concordance between patient and physician assessment 
      for individual questions was assessed using weighted kappa analysis. QoL scores 
      were compared using Wilcoxons signed rank test. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients 
      were recruited over a period of 5 months. Overall, the weighted kappa showed 
      relatively poor concordance between the patient and physician responses; mean 
      kappa: 0.33 (range 0.18-0.57). The physician underestimated QoL score in 4/9 
      domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated QoL score in 5/9 domains by a mean of 
      6.9%. In particular, physicians underestimated the impact of LUTS on social 
      limitations and emotions (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study confirms that 
      physicians often differ from patients in the assessment of QoL. This is most 
      likely due to a difference in patient-physician perception of "significant" LUTS 
      and clearly demonstrates the importance of patient evaluated QoL in routine 
      clinical assessment.
