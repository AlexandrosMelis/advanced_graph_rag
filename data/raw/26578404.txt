AB  - CONTEXT: Breathlessness is one of the most distressing symptoms experienced by 
      patients with advanced cancer and noncancer diagnoses alike. Often, severity of 
      breathlessness increases quickly, calling for rapid symptom control. Oral, 
      buccal, and parenteral routes of provider-controlled drug administration have 
      been described. It is unclear whether patient-controlled therapy (PCT) systems 
      would be an additional treatment option. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether 
      intravenous opioid PCT can be an effective therapeutic method to reduce 
      breathlessness in patients with advanced disease. Secondary aims were to study 
      the feasibility and acceptance of opioid PCT in patients with refractory 
      breathlessness. METHODS: This was a pilot observational study with 18 inpatients 
      with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness receiving opioid PCT. 
      Breathlessness was measured on a self-reported numeric rating scale. Richmond 
      Agitation Sedation Scale scores, Palliative Performance Scale scores, vital 
      signs, and a self-developed patient satisfaction questionnaire were used for 
      measuring secondary outcomes. Descriptive and interference analyses (Friedman 
      test) and post hoc analyses (Wilcoxon tests and Bonferroni corrections) were 
      performed. RESULTS: Eighteen of 815 patients (advanced cancer; median 
      age = 57.5 years [range 36-81]; 77.8% female) received breathlessness symptom 
      control with opioid PCT; daily morphine equivalent dose at Day 1 was 
      median = 20.3 mg (5.0-49.6 mg); Day 2: 13.0 mg (1.0-78.5 mg); Day 3: 16.0 mg 
      (8.3-47.0 mg). Numeric rating scale of current breathlessness decreased 
      (baseline: median = 5 [range 1-10]; Day 1: median = 4 [range 0-8], P < 0.01; Day 
      2: median = 4 [range 0-5], P < 0.01). Physiological parameters were stable over 
      time. On Day 3, 12/12 patients confirmed that this mode of application provided 
      relief of breathlessness. CONCLUSION: Opioid PCT is a feasible and acceptable 
      therapeutic method to reduce refractory breathlessness in palliative care 
      patients.
