TI  - Do lipids, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking confer equal risk of myocardial 
      infarction in women as in men? The Reykjavik Study.
PG  - 67-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on coronary risk factors in men and women are mainly based on 
      mortality data and few compare results of both sexes with consistent study design 
      and diagnostic criteria. This study assesses the major risk factors for coronary 
      events in men and women from the Reykjavik Study. DESIGN: Within a prospective, 
      population-based cohort study individuals without history of myocardial 
      infarction were identified and the relative risk of baseline variables was 
      assessed in relation to verified myocardial infarction or coronary death during 
      follow-up. METHODS: Of the 9681 women and 8888 men who attended risk assessment 
      from 1967-1991, with follow-up period of up to 28 years, 706 women and 1700 men 
      suffered a non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death. RESULTS: Serum 
      cholesterol was a significant risk factor for both sexes, with hazard ratios (HR) 
      decreasing with age. Systolic blood pressure was a stronger risk factor for women 
      as was ECG-confirmed left ventricular hypertrophy (women HR 2.89, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 1.67-5.01; men HR 1.11 [CI 0.86-1.43]). Fasting blood glucose > or 
      =6.7 mmol/L identified significantly higher risk for women (HR 2.65) than men (HR 
      2.08) as did self-reported diabetes. Triglyceride risk was significantly higher 
      for women and decreased significantly with age. Smoking increased risk two- to 
      five-fold, increasing with dose, for women, which was significantly higher than 
      the doubling in risk for men. CONCLUSIONS: This large study of the major risk 
      factors compared between the sexes demonstrates similar relative risk of 
      myocardial infarction associated with cholesterol for both sexes, however, the 
      relative risk is higher in women for many other risk factors such as smoking, 
      diabetes, elevated triglycerides and left ventricular hypertrophy.
