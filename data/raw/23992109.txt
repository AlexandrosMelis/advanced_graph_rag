AB  - INTRODUCTION: The solitary kidney (SK) is currently debated in the literature, as 
      living kidney donation is extensively used and the diagnosis of congenital SK is 
      frequent. Tubulointerstitial lesions associated with adaptive phenomena may occur 
      early within the SK. AIMS: Analysis of the significance of urinary biomarkers in 
      the assessment of tubulointerstitial lesions of the SK. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study of 37 patients with SK included 18 patients-acquired SK 
      (mean age 56.44 +/- 12.20 years, interval from nephrectomy 10.94 +/- 9.37 years), 19 
      patients-congenital SK (mean age 41.52 +/- 10.54 years). Urinary NAG, urinary 
      alpha-1-microglobulin, albuminuria, eGFR (CKD-EPI equation) were measured. 
      RESULTS: In acquired SK, NAG increased in 60.66%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin 
      in 16.66%, albuminuria in 55.55% of patients. Inverse correlation with eGFR 
      presented NAG (R(2 )= 0.537, p = 0.022), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin 
      (R(2 )= 0.702, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.655, p = 0.003). In congenital 
      SK, NAG increased in 52.63%, urinary alpha 1-microglobulin in 5.26%, albuminuria 
      in 47.36% of patients. In this group, urinary biomarkers correlated inversely 
      with eGFR: NAG (R(2 )= 0.743, p < 0.001), urinary alpha 1-microglobulin 
      (R(2 )= 0.701, p = 0.001), albuminuria (R(2 )= 0.821, p < 0.001). Significant 
      correlations were found between the urinary biomarkers in both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Urinary biomarkers allow a non-invasive, sensitive, early assessment 
      of the tubular lesions of the SK. Urinary biomarkers of PT injury parallel renal 
      function decline, thus complementing the estimation of GFR. Monitoring of PT 
      dysfunction is mandatory in patients with SK.
