TI  - Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain?
PG  - 756-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess quality of storage of vaccines in the community. DESIGN: 
      Questionnaire survey of general practices and child health clinics, and 
      monitoring of storage temperatures of selected refrigerators. SETTING: Central 
      Manchester and Bradford health districts. SUBJECTS: 45 general practices and five 
      child health clinics, of which 40 (80%) responded. Eight practices were selected 
      for refrigeration monitoring. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence to Department of 
      Health guidelines for vaccine storage, temperature range to which vaccines were 
      exposed over two weeks. RESULTS: Of the 40 respondents, only 16 were aware of the 
      appropriate storage conditions for the vaccines; eight had minimum and maximum 
      thermometers but only one of these was monitored daily. In six of the eight 
      practices selected for monitoring of refrigeration temperatures the vaccines were 
      exposed to either subzero temperatures (three fridges) or temperatures up to 16 
      degrees C (three). Two of these were specialised drug storage refrigerators with 
      an incorporated thermostat and external temperature gauges. CONCLUSION: Vaccines 
      were exposed to temperatures that may reduce their potency. Safe storage of 
      vaccines in the clinics cannot be ensured without adhering to the recommended 
      guidelines. Provision of adequate equipment and training for staff in maintaining 
      the "cold chain" and the use and care of equipment are important components of a 
      successful immunisation programme.
