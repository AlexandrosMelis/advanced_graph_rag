AB  - OBJECTIVE: We analyzed cytokines levels in patients with epilepsy and new onset 
      seizure and correlated it with various parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 
      obtaining consent, serum samples from 100 patients with epilepsy or new onset 
      seizure were prospectively collected in the immediate post-ictal phase. In 16 
      patients, a second sample was collected during the seizure-free period. The serum 
      cytokine levels [TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6] were 
      assessed (ELISA) in these patients and 100 matched healthy controls. CSF analysis 
      was carried out in 9 patients of this cohort, when clinically indicated. RESULTS: 
      The type of seizures (n=100) was major (45), partial (41) and status epilepticus 
      (SE=14), while the epilepsy syndromes were idiopathic generalized (53) and 
      localization related (47). The detectable serum cytokines in the patient group 
      (n=100) were: IL-6 (42), TNF-alpha (36), IL-2 (22), IL-4 (22), IFN-gamma (20) and 
      IL-1 (11) compared to the controls. CSF IL-6 and IL-1 was detectable in 4/9 and 
      2/9 patients, respectively while, IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma was detectable 1 in each 
      patient. Correlations were noted between male gender and IL-1beta (p=0.04), 
      positive family history and IL-1beta (p=0.001), "no alcohol use" and TNF-alpha 
      (p=0.05), more than one year history of epilepsy and IL-1beta (p=0.02), status 
      epilepticus (SE) and IL-6 (p=0.04). There was no difference between the new onset 
      seizures vs. epilepsy group. Serial analysis during the seizure-free period 
      revealed a decrease in cytokine levels: TNF-alpha (25% to 12.5%), IFN-gamma 
      (12.5% to 0%), IL-1 (25% to 0) and IL-2 (6.2% to 6.2%), IL-4 (18.8% to 0%) and 
      IL-6 (18.8% to 6.2%). CONCLUSIONS: We found increased post-ictal serum cytokine 
      levels in patients with several epilepsy syndromes.
