      dysfunction?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sporadic data present in literature report how preterm birth and low 
      birth weight are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases in 
      later life. High levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a strong inhibitor 
      of nitric oxide synthesis, are associated with the future development of adverse 
      cardiovascular events and cardiac death. AIMS: 1) to verify the presence of a 
      statistically significant difference between ADMA levels in young adults born 
      preterm at extremely low birth weight (<1000 g; ex-ELBW) and those of a control 
      group of healthy adults born at term (C) and 2) to seek correlations between ADMA 
      levels in ex-ELBW and anthropometric and clinical parameters (gender, 
      chronological age, gestational age, birth weight, and duration of stay in 
      Neonatal Intensive Care Unit). METHODS: Thirty-two ex-ELBW subjects (11 males [M] 
      and 21 females [F], aged 17-29years, mean age 22.2 +/- 2.3 years) were compared 
      with 25 C (7 M and 18F). ADMA levels were assessed by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography with highly sensitive laser fluorescent detection. RESULTS: ADMA 
      levels were reduced in ex-ELBW subjects compared to C (0.606+0.095 vs 0.562+0.101 
      mumol/L, p<0.05), and significantly correlated inversely with gestational age 
      (r=-0.61, p<0.00001) and birth weight (r=-0.57, p<0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings reveal a significant decrease in ADMA levels of ex-ELBW subjects 
      compared to C, underlining a probable correlation with preterm birth and low 
      birth weight. Taken together, these results may underlie the onset of early 
      circulatory dysfunction predictive of increased cardiovascular risk.
