TI  - Can dose reduction to one parotid gland prevent xerostomia?--A feasibility study 
      for locally advanced head and neck cancer patients treated with 
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy.
PG  - 497-504
AB  - AIMS: Dryness of the mouth is one of the most distressing chronic toxicities of 
      radiation therapy in head and neck cancers. In this study, parotid function was 
      assessed in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing 
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. Parotid 
      function was assessed with the help of a questionnaire and parotid scintigraphy, 
      especially with regards to unilateral sparing of the parotid gland. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: In total, 19 patients were treated with compensator-based IMRT between 
      February 2003 and March 2004. The dose to the clinical target volume ranged 
      between 66 and 70 Gy in 30-35 fractions to 95% of the isodose volume. Ipsilateral 
      high-risk neck nodes received an average dose of 60 Gy and the contralateral 
      low-risk neck received a dose of 54-56 Gy. Eight of 19 patients also received 
      concomitant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Subjective toxicity to the parotid glands was 
      assessed with the help of a questionnaire at 0, 3 and 6 months and objective 
      toxicity was assessed with parotid scintigraphy at 0 and 3 months. The mean dose 
      to the ipsilateral parotid gland ranged from 19.5 to 52.8 Gy (mean 33.14 Gy) and 
      the mean dose to the contralateral gland was 11.1-46.6 Gy (mean 26.85 Gy). At a 
      median follow-up of 13 months, 9/19 patients had no symptoms of dryness of the 
      mouth (grade I), 8/19 had mild dryness of the mouth (grade II) and only 2/19 had 
      grade III xerostomia, although the parotid gland could only be spared on one side 
      in most of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Minimising the radiation dose to one of the 
      parotid glands with the help of IMRT in patients with advanced head and neck 
      cancers can prevent xerostomia in most patients and parotid scintigraphy is a 
      useful method of documenting xerostomia.
