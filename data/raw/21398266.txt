AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults (OA) with advanced cancer (AC) undergoing phase I 
      clinical trials (PICT) have poor prognosis. There are no studies which describe 
      symptoms experienced by OA. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of PICT 
      participants >60 years. OA were compared by age (>65 vs 60-65) and by number of 
      symptoms (>3 vs </=3). RESULTS: N = 56. Mean age = 67.09; 48.21% female. Median 
      life-expectancy = 5 months (interquartile range = 2-9 months); 80.36% had pain; 
      of those 64% without pain scale. Most did not have interdisciplinary 
      professionals or hospice referrals. Older adults with >3 symptoms had more 
      admissions (37.5% vs 14.29%; P = .0335), complications (46.43% vs 16.07%; P = 
      .0026), and greater decline in functional status (24 participants >3 symptoms vs 
      8; P = .0173). There were no significant differences comparing OA by age. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Older adults enrolled in PICT with more symptoms may sacrifice QOL 
      for experimental treatment.
