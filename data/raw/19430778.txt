AB  - OBJECTIVE: To correlate magnetic resonance (MR) image findings with pain response 
      by provocation discography in patients with discogenic low back pain, with an 
      emphasis on the combination analysis of a high intensity zone (HIZ) and disc 
      contour abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-two patients (aged 17-68 
      years) with axial low back pain that was likely to be disc related underwent 
      lumbar discography (178 discs tested). The MR images were evaluated for disc 
      degeneration, disc contour abnormalities, HIZ, and endplate abnormalities. Based 
      on the combination of an HIZ and disc contour abnormalities, four classes were 
      determined: (1) normal or bulging disc without HIZ; (2) normal or bulging disc 
      with HIZ; (3) disc protrusion without HIZ; (4) disc protrusion with HIZ. These MR 
      image findings and a new combined MR classification were analyzed in the base of 
      concordant pain determined by discography. RESULTS: Disc protrusion with HIZ 
      [sensitivity 45.5%; specificity 97.8%; positive predictive value (PPV), 87.0%] 
      correlated significantly with concordant pain provocation (P < 0.01). A normal or 
      bulging disc with HIZ was not associated with reproduction of pain. Disc 
      degeneration (sensitivity 95.4%; specificity 38.8%; PPV 33.9%), disc protrusion 
      (sensitivity 68.2%; specificity 80.6%; PPV 53.6%), and HIZ (sensitivity 56.8%; 
      specificity 83.6%; PPV 53.2%) were not helpful in the identification of a disc 
      with concordant pain. CONCLUSION: The proposed MR classification is useful to 
      predict a disc with concordant pain. Disc protrusion with HIZ on MR imaging 
      predicted positive discography in patients with discogenic low back pain.
