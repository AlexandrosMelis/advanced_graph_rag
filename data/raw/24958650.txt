AB  - BACKGROUND: Our aim in this study was to investigate whether mean platelet volume 
      (MPV) value could be used as an early marker to predict pelvic inflammatory 
      disease (PID). METHODS: Overall, 44 patients with PID and 44 healthy women were 
      included in the study. The control group consisted of 44 women who applied to the 
      clinic for a routine gynaecological check-up, without chronic disease or a 
      history of medication use. Owing to the fact that it would affect thrombocyte 
      function, women who have the following conditions were excluded from the study: 
      women who were taking anticoagulant therapy, oral contraceptives, nonsteroid 
      anti-inflammatory medications and who had chronic diseases. The leukocyte count, 
      platelet count, neutrophil ratio and MPV values were collected from PID and the 
      control group. C reactive protein values of patients with PID were also noted. 
      RESULTS: MPV values in patients with PID were lower than those in the control 
      group. This reduction in MPV is statistically significant when the PID patient 
      group is compared with the control group (p < 0.001). A negative correlation was 
      discovered between platelet count and MPV values (p = 0.019, r = - 0.425). 
      Receiver-operating curve analysis pointed out that MPV has greater area under 
      curve value than neutrophil rate, leukocyte and platelet count (0.73, 0.64, 0.72 
      and 0.49 respectively). CONCLUSION: Since the MPV value was significantly 
      decreased in patients with PID, it may serve as an additional and even more 
      valuable marker than leukocyte count in the diagnosis of PID.
