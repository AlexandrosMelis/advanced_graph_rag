      it always necessary?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis is a risk factor for 
      perioperative stroke in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery (CAB). 
      Although selective and non-selective methods of preoperative carotid screening 
      have been advocated, it remains unclear if this screening is clinically relevant. 
      AIM: To test whether selective carotid screening is as effective as non-selective 
      screening in detecting significant carotid disease. METHODS: The case records of 
      patients consecutively undergoing CAB were reviewed. Patients were stratified 
      retrospectively into high- or low-risk groups according to risk factors for 
      significant carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke: peripheral vascular 
      disease (PVD), carotid bruit, diabetes mellitus, age >70 years and/or history of 
      cerebrovascular disease. Prevalence of carotid stenosis detected by 
      ultrasonography, surgical management and perioperative stroke rates were 
      determined in each group. RESULTS: Overall, 205 consecutive patients underwent 
      preoperative carotid screening. The prevalence of significant carotid stenosis 
      was 5.8%. Univariate analysis confirmed that PVD (P=0.005), carotid bruit 
      (P=0.003) and diabetes mellitus (P=0.05) were significant risk factors for 
      stenosis. Carotid stenosis was a risk factor for stroke (P=0.03). Prevalence of 
      carotid stenosis was higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) than the low-risk group 
      (1.2%) (P<0.05). All concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB (5/205) 
      and all patients who had perioperative strokes (5/205) were in the high-risk 
      group (P=0.01). CONCLUSION: In our cohort, selective screening of patients aged 
      >70 years, with carotid bruit, a history of cerebrovascular disease, diabetes 
      mellitus or PVD would have reduced the screening load by 40%, with trivial impact 
      on surgical management or neurological outcomes.
