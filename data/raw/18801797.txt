AB  - BACKGROUND: Fruit and vegetables are protective of a number of chronic diseases; 
      however, their intakes have been shown to vary by socioeconomic position (SEP). 
      Household and food shopping environmental factors are thought to contribute to 
      these differences. To determine whether household and food shopping environmental 
      factors are associated with fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes, and contribute to 
      socioeconomic inequalities in FV consumption. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were 
      obtained by a postal questionnaire among 4333 adults (23-85 years) living in 168 
      neighbourhoods in the south-eastern Netherlands. Participants agreed/disagreed 
      with a number of statements about the characteristics of their household and food 
      shopping environments, including access, prices and quality. Education was used 
      to characterise socioeconomic position (SEP). Main outcome measures were whether 
      or not participants consumed fruit or vegetables on a daily basis. Multilevel 
      logistic regression models examined between-area variance in FV consumption and 
      associations between characteristics of the household and food shopping 
      environments and FV consumption. RESULTS: Only a few household and food shopping 
      environmental factors were significantly associated with fruit and vegetable 
      consumption, and their prevalence was low. Participants who perceived FV to be 
      expensive were more likely to consume them. There were significant socioeconomic 
      inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption (ORs of not consuming fruit and 
      vegetables were 4.26 and 5.47 among the lowest-educated groups for fruit and 
      vegetables, respectively); however, these were not explained by any household or 
      food shopping environmental factors. CONCLUSIONS: Improving access to FV in the 
      household and food shopping environments will only make a small contribution to 
      improving population consumption levels, and may only have a limited effect in 
      reducing socioeconomic inequalities in their consumption.
