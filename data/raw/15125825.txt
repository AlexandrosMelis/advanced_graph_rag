TI  - Starting insulin in type 2 diabetes: continue oral hypoglycemic agents? A 
      randomized trial in primary care.
PG  - 393-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of insulin 30/70 twice daily or bedtime 
      isophane (NPH) insulin plus continued sulfonylurea and metformin in patients with 
      type 2 diabetes in primary care. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, randomized trial. 
      POPULATION: Persons younger than 76 years with type 2 diabetes whose disease had 
      not been controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents alone. A total of 64 
      insulin-naive patients treated with maximal feasible dosages of sulfonylurea and 
      metformin (baseline glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c]=8.5%) were randomly assigned 
      to insulin monotherapy (IM group; n=31) or insulin in addition to unchanged oral 
      hypoglycemic medication (IC group; n=33) for 12 months. Insulin doses were 
      adjusted to obtain fasting glucose <7.0 mmol/L and postprandial glucose <10.0 
      mmol/L. OUTCOMES MEASURED: Outcome measures included HbA1c, treatment failure, 
      weight, hypoglycemic events and symptoms, satisfaction with treatment, general 
      well-being, and fear of injecting insulin and testing. RESULTS: HbA1c improved 
      from 8.3% to 7.6% in the IC group, and from 8.8% to 7.6% in the IM group (P=NS). 
      The IC group had 24% treatment failures, compared with 2% in the IM group 
      (P=.09). Patients in the IC group had less weight gain than those in the IM group 
      (1.3 vs 4.2 kg; P=.01), and they reported fewer hypoglycemic events (2.7 vs 4.3; 
      P=.02). Increased satisfaction with treatment was equal in the 2 groups, and 
      general well-being improved by 3.0 points more in the IC group (P=.05). Fear of 
      self-injecting and self-testing did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Bedtime NPH insulin 
      added to maximal therapy with sulfonylurea and metformin is an effective, simple, 
      well-tolerated approach for patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.
