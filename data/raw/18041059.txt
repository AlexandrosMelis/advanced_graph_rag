TI  - Do adjuvant aromatase inhibitors increase the cardiovascular risk in 
      postmenopausal women with early breast cancer? Meta-analysis of randomized 
      trials.
PG  - 260-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the advantages from using aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared 
      with tamoxifen for early breast cancer, an unexpectedly greater number of grade 3 
      and 4 cardiovascular events (CVAE) (as defined by National Cancer Institute of 
      Canada-Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0] was demonstrated. METHODS: Phase 3 
      randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing AI with tamoxifen in early breast 
      cancer were considered eligible for this review. The event-based risk ratios 
      (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were derived, and a test of 
      heterogeneity was applied. Finally, absolute differences (ADs) in event rates and 
      the number of patients needed to harm 1 patient (NNH) were determined. RESULTS: 
      Seven eligible RCTs (19,818 patients) reported CVAE results. When considering all 
      RCTs, the AD of the primary endpoint (CVAE) between the 2 arms (0.52%), tamoxifen 
      versus AI, was statistically significant (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.07-1.60; P= .007). 
      This translated into an NNH value of 189 patients; when only third-generation AIs 
      were considered, the difference (0.57%) remained significant (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 
      1.09-1.63; P= .0038). Thromboembolic events were significantly more frequent in 
      the tamoxifen arm, regardless of the strategy adopted (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 
      0.42-0.65; P< .0001), without significant heterogeneity (P= .21). An AD of 1.17% 
      and an NNH value of 85 patients were observed. CONCLUSIONS: According to the 
      results from this meta-analysis, the risk of grade 3 and 4 CVAEs in patients who 
      were receiving AIs was higher compared with the risk in patients who were 
      receiving tamoxifen, and the difference reached statistical significance. 
      However, the AD was relatively low, and from 160 to 180 patients had to be 
      treated to produce 1 event.
