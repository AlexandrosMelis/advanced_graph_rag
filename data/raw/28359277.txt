AB  - BACKGROUND: Governments are urged to determine methods to control the use of 
      medical resources and curb the rise of healthcare costs. The question is, do 
      health behaviors have an impact on the use of medical resources? This study aims 
      to identify and understand the difference in the number of outpatient visits and 
      health examinations based on various health behaviors and to determine whether 
      patients seek medical care for illness from the same physicians. METHODS: This 
      study used the dataset derived from the Department of Budget, Accounting and 
      Statistics of Kaohsiung, Taiwan in 2005. Persons older than 15 years were 
      surveyed using an on-site questionnaire. A total of 2911 persons were enrolled in 
      this study. Independent t-tests, chi-square tests, one-way ANOVA, multiple linear 
      regression and binominal logistic regression were used in the data analysis. 
      RESULTS: The regression model for the frequency of doctor visits, health 
      examinations, and whether the same physician is sought for medical care has 
      demonstrated significant correlations with gender, age and education-level 
      variables. Four health behaviors (i.e., exercise habits, dietary habits, regular 
      blood pressure measurement, drinking habits) exhibited a significant correlation 
      with healthcare utilization (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Healthy lifestyles lead to an 
      increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not 
      much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health 
      behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their 
      blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient 
      visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation 
      services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of 
      maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
