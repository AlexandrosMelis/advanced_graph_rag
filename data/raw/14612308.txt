TI  - Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay? an analysis of 2000 cases.
PG  - 209-19
AB  - PRISM is claimed to score disease severity which has attributed an impact on 
      length of PICU stay (LOS). PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of PRISM on 
      LOS, and evaluate an Artificial Neural Network's (ANN) performance to estimate 
      LOS from PRISM item patterns. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Retrospectively we 
      performed correlation and regression analyses on routinely scored PRISM data of 
      all consecutive admissions to our level-III PICU from 1994 to 1999 (n > 2000) 
      with individual LOS. In addition, an ANN was trained on the chronologically first 
      75% of those data (inputs, PRISM items + age + sex; output, LOS). The ANN's 
      performance was tested on the remaining most recent 25% of the data sets. MAIN 
      RESULTS: The Spearman and Pearson coefficients of correlation between PRISM and 
      LOS were 0.2 (p < 0.001) and 0.08 (p = 0.0003), the latter being slightly higher 
      when LOS was logarithmically transformed. Pearson's coefficient of correlation 
      between ANN derived LOS estimate and actual LOS was 0.21 (p < 0.001) (LOS 
      logarithmically transformed: 0.34; p < 0.001) in the independent validation 
      sample. CONCLUSIONS: The ANN with its intrinsic ability to detect non-linear 
      correlation, and to relate specific item patterns to LOS, outperformed linear 
      statistics but was still disappointing in estimating individual LOS. It might be 
      speculated that therapeutic intervention modulates the natural course of the 
      disease thus counteracting both disease severity as initially scored by PRISM, 
      and LOS. This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM 
      based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.
