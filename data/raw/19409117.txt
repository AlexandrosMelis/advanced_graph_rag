TI  - Can infundibular height predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stone after 
      extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy?
PG  - 140-9; discussion 149-50
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) 
      on lower calyceal calculi in relation to the renal anatomical factors and 
      determine which of these factors can be used to select patients who will benefit 
      from SWL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 78 patients with 
      single radiopaque lower calyceal stones treated with SWL. The patients were 
      evaluated 3 months after lithotripsy with a simple abdominal X-ray and a kidney 
      ultrasound scan. The success of the treatment, removal of all fragments, was 
      correlated with renal anatomical factors measured in the pre-treatment 
      intravenous urography: infundibulopelvic angle, lower infundibulum width, lower 
      infundibulum length, ratio length/width, infundibulum height, and number of minor 
      calyces in the lower calyceal group. RESULTS: Three months after SWL treatment, 
      39 patients were stone-free (NR group) and 39 had residual fragments (R group). 
      Both groups presented no differences in relation to infundibulopelvic angle, 
      width and length of the lower calyceal infundibulum, length/width ratio of the 
      lower infundibulum or number of lower calyces. Height of the infundibulum, 
      described as the distance between the line passing through the lowest part of the 
      calyx containing the calculus and the highest point of the lower lip of renal 
      pelvis, was the only parameter in which significant differences (p = 0.002) were 
      found between the NR and R groups. CONCLUSIONS: Lower Infundibular height could 
      be a good measurement tool for deciding which patients with lower calyceal 
      lithiasis would benefit from SWL treatment. Height of less than 22 mm suggests a 
      good outcome from lithotripsy.
