TI  - Does bone anchor fixation improve the outcome of percutaneous bladder neck 
      suspension in female stress urinary incontinence?
PG  - 192-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcome of a new modification of percutaneous needle 
      suspension, using a bone anchor system for fixing the suture at the public bone, 
      and to compare the results with those published previously. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      From March 1996, 37 patients with stress urinary incontinence (> 2 years) were 
      treated using a bone anchor system. On each side the suture was attached to the 
      pubocervical fascia and the vaginal wall via a broad 'Z'-stitch. A urodynamic 
      investigation performed preoperatively in all patients confirmed stress 
      incontinence and excluded detrusor instability. The outcome was assessed by 
      either by a clinical follow-up investigation or using a standardized 
      questionnaire, over a mean follow-up of 11 months (range 6-18). RESULTS: In the 
      37 patients, the procedure was successful in 25 (68%), with 16 (43%) of the 
      patients completely dry and nine (24%) significantly improved. Removal of the 
      bone anchor and suture was necessary in two patients, because of unilateral 
      bacterial infection in one and a bilateral soft tissue granuloma in the other. 
      One bone anchor became dislocated in a third patient. In two cases where the 
      treatment failed, new detrusor instability was documented urodynamically. Minor 
      complications were prolonged wound pain in 10 (26%) and transient urinary 
      retention or residual urine in 12 patients (32%). CONCLUSION: The poor success 
      rate in the study corresponds with the long-term results of conventional or 
      modified needle suspension procedures and does not reinforce the optimistic 
      results of bone anchoring published recently. Because of the poorer long-term 
      results from percutaneous needle suspension than from other techniques of open 
      retropubic bladder neck suspension, it remains questionable whether percutaneous 
      needle suspension should be considered a first-line procedure for the treatment 
      of female stress urinary incontinence.
