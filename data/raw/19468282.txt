AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multicenter longitudinal cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To 
      validate the prognostic value of the acute phase sacral sparing measurements with 
      regard to chronic phase-independent ambulation in patients with traumatic spinal 
      cord injury (SCI). SETTING: European Multicenter Study of Human Spinal Cord 
      Injury (EM-SCI). METHODS: In 432 patients, acute phase (0-15 days) American 
      Spinal Injury Association (ASIA)/International Spinal Cord Society neurological 
      standard scale (AIS) grades, ASIA sacral sparing measurements, which are S4-5 
      light touch (LT), S4-5 pin prick (PP), anal sensation and voluntary anal 
      contraction; and chronic phase (6 or 12 months) indoor mobility Spinal Cord 
      Independence Measure (SCIM) measurements were analyzed. Calculations of positive 
      and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) as well as univariate and multivariate 
      logistic regressions were performed in all four sacral sparing criteria. The area 
      under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) ratios of all regression 
      equations was calculated. RESULTS: To achieve independent ambulation 1-year post 
      injury, a normal S4-5 PP score showed the best PPV (96.5%, P<0.001, 95% 
      confidence interval (95% CI): 87.9-99.6). Best NPV was reported in the S4-5 LT 
      score (91.7%, P<0.001, 95% CI: 81.6-97.2). The use of the combination of only 
      voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP sensory scores (AUC: 0.906, 
      P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.871-0.941) showed significantly better (P<0.001, 95% CI: 
      0.038-0.128) discriminating results in prognosticating 1-year independent 
      ambulation than with the use of currently used distinction between complete and 
      incomplete SCI (AUC: 0.823, P<0.001, 95% CI: 0.781-0.864). CONCLUSIONS: Out of 
      the four sacral sparing criteria, the acute phase anal sensory score measurements 
      do not contribute significantly to the prognosis of independent ambulation. The 
      combination of the acute phase voluntary anal contraction and the S4-5 LT and PP 
      scores, predicts significantly better chronic phase-independent ambulation 
      outcomes than the currently used distinction between complete and incomplete SCI.
