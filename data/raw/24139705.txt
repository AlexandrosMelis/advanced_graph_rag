AB  - AIM: In the TELEDIAB-1 study, the Diabeo system (a smartphone coupled to a 
      website) improved HbA1c by 0.9% vs controls in patients with chronic, poorly 
      controlled type 1 diabetes. The system provided two main functions: automated 
      advice on the insulin doses required; and remote monitoring by teleconsultation. 
      The question is: how much did each function contribute to the improvement in 
      HbA1c? METHODS: Each patient received a smartphone with an insulin dose advisor 
      (IDA) and with (G3 group) or without (G2 group) the 
      telemonitoring/teleconsultation function. Patients were classified as "high 
      users" if the proportion of "informed" meals using the IDA exceeded 67% (median) 
      and as "low users" if not. Also analyzed was the respective impact of the IDA 
      function and teleconsultations on the final HbA1c levels. RESULTS: Among the high 
      users, the proportion of informed meals remained stable from baseline to the end 
      of the study 6months later (from 78.1+/-21.5% to 73.8+/-25.1%; P=0.107), but 
      decreased in the low users (from 36.6+/-29.4% to 26.7+/-28.4%; P=0.005). As expected, 
      HbA1c improved in high users from 8.7% [range: 8.3-9.2%] to 8.2% [range: 
      7.8-8.7%] in patients with (n=26) vs without (n=30) the benefit of 
      telemonitoring/teleconsultation (-0.49+/-0.60% vs -0.52+/-0.73%, respectively; 
      P=0.879). However, although HbA1c also improved in low users from 9.0% [8.5-10.1] 
      to 8.5% [7.9-9.6], those receiving support via teleconsultation tended to show 
      greater improvement than the others (-0.93+/-0.97 vs -0.46+/-1.05, respectively; 
      P=0.084). CONCLUSION: The Diabeo system improved glycaemic control in both high 
      and low users who avidly used the IDA function, while the greatest improvement 
      was seen in the low users who had the motivational support of teleconsultations.
