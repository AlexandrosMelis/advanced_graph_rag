TI  - Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair: is reimplantation of spinal cord 
      arteries a waste of time?
PG  - 1670-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The impact of different strategies for management of intercostal and 
      lumbar arteries during repair of thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms 
      (TAA/A) on the prevention of paraplegia remains poorly understood. METHODS: One 
      hundred consecutive patients with intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked 
      potentials (MEP) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) during TAA/A repair 
      involving serial segmental artery sacrifice (October 2002 to December 2004) were 
      reviewed. RESULTS: Operative mortality was 6%. The median intensive care unit 
      stay was 2.5 days (IQ range: 1-4 days), and the median hospital stay 10.0 days 
      (IQ range: 8-17 days). Potentials remained unchanged during the course of serial 
      segmental artery sacrifice, or could be returned to baseline levels by anesthetic 
      and blood pressure manipulation, in 99 of 100 cases. An average of 8.0 +/- 2.6 
      segmental artery pairs were sacrificed overall, with an average of 4.5 +/- 2.1 
      segmental pairs sacrificed between T7 and L1, where the artery of Adamkiewicz is 
      presumed to arise. Postoperative paraplegia occurred in 2 patients. In 1, 
      immediate paraplegia was precipitated by an intraoperative dissection, resulting 
      in 6 hours of lower body ischemia. A second ambulatory patient had severe 
      paraparesis albeit normal cerebral function after resuscitation from a 
      respiratory arrest. CONCLUSIONS: With monitoring of MEP and SSEP, 
      sacrifice--without reimplantation--of as many as 15 intercostal and lumbar 
      arteries during TAA/A repair is safe, resulting in acceptably low rates of 
      immediate and delayed paraplegia. This experience suggests that routine surgical 
      implantation of segmental vessels is not indicated, and that, with evolving 
      understanding of spinal cord perfusion, endovascular repair of the entire 
      thoracic aorta should ultimately be possible without spinal cord injury.
