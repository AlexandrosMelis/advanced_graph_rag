TI  - Bridge experience with long-term implantable left ventricular assist devices. Are 
      they an alternative to transplantation?
PG  - 1844-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: If long-term use of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as 
      bridges to transplantation is successful, the issue of permanent device 
      implantation in lieu of transplantation could be addressed through the creation 
      of appropriately designed trials. Our medium-term experience with both 
      pneumatically and electrically powered ThermoCardiosystems LVADs is presented to 
      outline the benefits and limitations of device support in lieu of 
      transplantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Detailed records were kept prospectively 
      for all patients undergoing LVAD insertion. Fifty-eight LVADs were inserted over 
      5 years, with a survival rate of 74%. Mean patient age was 50 years, and duration 
      of support averaged 98 days. Although common, both preexisting infection and 
      infection during LVAD support were not associated with increased mortality or 
      decreased rate of successful transplantation. Thromboembolic complications were 
      rare, occurring in only three patients (5%) despite the absence of 
      anticoagulation. Ventricular arrhythmias were well tolerated in all patients 
      except in cases of early perioperative right ventricular failure, with no deaths. 
      Right ventricular failure occurred in one third of patients and was managed in a 
      small percentage by right ventricular assist device (RVAD) support and/or inhaled 
      nitric oxide therapy. There were no serious device malfunctions, but five 
      graft-related hemorrhages resulted in two deaths. Finally, a variety of 
      noncardiac surgical procedures were performed in LVAD recipients, with no major 
      morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Over all, our medium-term experience with 
      implantable LVAD support is encouraging. Although additional areas of 
      investigation exist, improvements in patients selection and management together 
      with device alterations that have reduced the thromboembolic incidence and 
      facilitated patient rehabilitation lead us to believe that a prospective, 
      randomized trial is indicated to study the role that LVADs may have as an 
      alternative to medical management.
