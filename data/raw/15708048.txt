TI  - Does prior benign prostate biopsy predict outcome for patients treated with 
      radical perineal prostatectomy?
PG  - 332-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of prior benign prostate biopsies on the 
      surgical and clinical outcomes of patients treated with radical perineal 
      prostatectomy for prostate cancer. METHODS: A total of 1369 patients with 
      clinically localized prostate cancer underwent radical prostatectomy by a single 
      surgeon between 1991 and 2001. A subset of 203 patients (14.9%), who had 
      undergone at least one prior benign prostate biopsy for a rising 
      prostate-specific antigen and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, constituted 
      our study population. A total of 1115 patients with no prior biopsy represented 
      our control group. After prostatectomy, patients were evaluated at 6-month 
      intervals for biochemical evidence of recurrence, defined as a prostate-specific 
      antigen level of 0.5 ng/mL or greater. RESULTS: Patients with a prior benign 
      biopsy had more favorable pathologic features with more organ-confined (74% 
      versus 64%; P <0.001) and less margin-positive (9.8% versus 18%) disease. Only 24 
      patients (12%) in the study group (versus 20% in control group; P = 0.01) had 
      eventual evidence of biochemical failure. Kaplan-Meier analyses suggested that 
      patients with prior benign biopsies have improved biochemical disease-free 
      survival, especially for those with more aggressive disease (Gleason sum 7 or 
      greater; P <0.01). Overall, patients in the study group had lower probability 
      (odds ratio 0.57, P <0.001) of biochemical failure compared with those in the 
      control group. CONCLUSIONS: A prior benign prostate biopsy may be independently 
      associated with more favorable surgical and biochemical outcomes after 
      prostatectomy. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.
