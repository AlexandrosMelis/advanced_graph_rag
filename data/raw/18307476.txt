      disability in the elderly?

AB  - CONTEXT: The robust relationship between socioeconomic factors and health 
      suggests that social and economic policies might substantially affect health, 
      while other evidence suggests that medical care, the main focus of current health 
      policy, may not be the primary determinant of population health. Income support 
      policies are one promising avenue to improve population health. This study 
      examines whether the federal cash transfer program to poor elderly, the 
      Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, affects old-age disability. METHODS: 
      This study uses the 1990 and 2000 censuses, employing state and year fixed-effect 
      models, to test whether within-state changes in maximum SSI benefits over time 
      lead to changes in disability among people aged sixty-five and older. FINDINGS: 
      Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates. Among all single elderly 
      individuals, 30 percent have mobility limitations, and an increase of $100 per 
      month in the maximum SSI benefit caused the rate of mobility limitations to fall 
      by 0.46 percentage points. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. 
      First, analyses limited to those most likely to receive SSI produced larger 
      effects, but analyses limited to those least likely to receive SSI produced no 
      measurable effect. Second, varying the disability measure did not meaningfully 
      alter the findings. Third, excluding the institutionalized, immigrants, 
      individuals living in states with exceptionally large benefit changes, and 
      individuals living in states with no SSI supplements did not change the 
      substantive conclusions. Fourth, Medicaid did not confound the effects. Finally, 
      these results were robust for married individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Income support 
      policy may be a significant new lever for improving population health, especially 
      that of lower-income persons. Even though the findings are robust, further 
      analyses are needed to confirm their reliability. Future research should examine 
      a variety of different income support policies, as well as whether a broader 
      range of social and economic policies affect health.
