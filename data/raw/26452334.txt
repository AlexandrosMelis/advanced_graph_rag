      effort? A method comparison study.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the reproducibility of different 
      measurement methods and define the most workable technique for measuring head and 
      neck paragangliomas, to determine the best method for evaluating tumour growth. 
      The evaluation of tumour growth is vital for a 'wait-and-scan' policy, a 
      management strategy that became increasingly important. STUDY DESIGN: Method 
      comparison study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty tumours, including carotid 
      body, vagal body, jugulotympanic tumours and conglomerates of multiple tumours, 
      were measured in duplicate, using linear dimensions, manual area tracing and an 
      automated segmentation method. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Reproducibility was 
      assessed using the Bland-Altman method. RESULTS: The smallest detectable 
      difference using the linear dimension method was 11% for carotid body and 27% for 
      vagal body tumours, compared with 17% and 20% for the manual area tracing method. 
      Due to the irregular shape of paragangliomas in the temporal bone and 
      conglomerates, the manual area tracing method showed better results in these 
      tumours (26% and 8% versus 54% and 47%). The linear dimension method was 
      significantly faster (median 4.27 versus 18.46 minutes, P < 0.001). The automatic 
      segmentation method yielded smallest detectable differences between 39% and 75%, 
      and although fast (2.19 +/- 1.49 minutes), it failed technically. CONCLUSIONS: Due 
      to a relatively good reproducibility, fast and easy application, we found the 
      linear dimension method to be the most pragmatic approach for evaluation of 
      growth of carotid and vagal body paragangliomas. For jugulotympanic tumours, the 
      preferred method is manual area tracing. However, volumetric changes of these 
      tumours may be of less clinical importance than changes in relation to 
      surrounding anatomical structures.
