TI  - Evaluation of pediatric VCUG at an academic children's hospital: is the 
      radiographic scout image necessary?

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is heterogeneity in how pediatric voiding cystourethrography 
      (VCUG) is performed. Some institutions, including our own, obtain a radiographic 
      scout image prior to contrast agent instillation. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that 
      the radiographic scout image does not augment VCUG interpretation or contribute 
      management-changing information but nonetheless carries a non-negligible 
      effective dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 181 children who underwent 
      VCUG in 2012, with an age breakdown of less than 1 year (56 children), 1-5 years 
      (66 children), 6-10 years (43 children) and 11-18 years (16 children), with a 
      mean age of 4.0 years. We investigated patient demographics, clinical indication 
      for the examination, scout image findings and estimated effective radiation dose, 
      as well as overall exam findings and impression. RESULTS: No clinically 
      significant or management-changing findings were present on scout images, and no 
      radiopaque urinary tract calculi or concerning incidental finding was identified. 
      Scout image estimated effective radiation dose averaged 0.09 mSv in children 
      younger than 1 y, 0.09 mSv in children age 1-5, 0.13 mSv in children age 6-10 and 
      0.18 mSv in children age 11-18. Total fluoroscopy time per examination averaged 
      36.7 s (range 34.8-39.6 s for all age group averages). Evaluation of known or 
      suspected vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and urinary tract infection (UTI) were the 
      most common clinical indications, stated in 40.9% and 37.0% of exams, 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the estimated effective dose is low for VCUG 
      radiographic scout images, this step did not augment VCUG interpretation or 
      contribute management-changing information. This step should be omitted or 
      substituted to further reduce dose in pediatric VCUG.
