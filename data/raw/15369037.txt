TI  - Do people who were passive smokers during childhood have increased risk of 
      long-term work disability? A 15-month prospective study of nurses' aides.
PG  - 296-300
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regular inhalation of tobacco smoke, whether it be voluntary or not, 
      may have profound negative effects on the body. Also intervertebral discs may be 
      affected. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that 
      nurses' aides who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home 
      during childhood have an increased risk of long-term sick leave. METHODS: The 
      sample comprised 5563 Norwegian nurses' aides, not on sick leave when they 
      completed a mailed questionnaire in 1999. Of these, 4744 (85.3%) completed a 
      second questionnaire 15 months later. The outcome measure was the incidence 
      proportion of long-term sick leave during the 12 months prior to the follow-up. 
      RESULTS: Respondents who reported at baseline that they had been exposed to ETS 
      at home during childhood had increased risk of sick leave exceeding 14 days 
      attributed to neck pain (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI): 
      1.04-1.73), high back pain (OR=1.49; CI: 1.07-2.06), low back pain (OR=1.21; CI: 
      0.97-1.50), and any illness (OR=1.23; CI: 1.07-1.42), after adjustments for 
      demographic and familial characteristics, former smoking, current smoking, 
      physical leisure-time activities, work factors, prior neck injury, and affective 
      symptoms. They also had increased risk of sick leave exceeding 8 weeks (OR=1.29; 
      CI: 1.08-1.55). CONCLUSION: The study supports the hypothesis that nurses' aides 
      who were exposed to ETS at home during childhood have an increased risk of 
      long-term sickness absence.
