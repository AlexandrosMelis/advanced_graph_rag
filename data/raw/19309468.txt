AB  - BACKGROUND: A variable effect of inflammation on alloimmunization to transfused 
      red blood cells (RBCs) in mice has been recently reported. We investigated 
      whether RBC alloimmunization in humans was affected by transfusion of blood 
      products in temporal proximity to experiencing a febrile transfusion reaction 
      (FTR) to platelets (PLTs), an event predominantly mediated by inflammatory 
      cytokines. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood bank databases were used to identify 
      patients who experienced an FTR or possible FTR to PLTs from August 2000 to March 
      2008 (FTR group). The control group of patients received a PLT transfusion on 
      randomly selected dates without experiencing an FTR. The "event" was defined as 
      the PLT transfusion that caused the FTR in the FTR group or the index PLT 
      transfusion in the control group. The number of transfused blood products and 
      their proximity to the event were recorded along with other recipient data. The 
      primary endpoint was the rate of RBC alloimmunization between the two groups. 
      RESULTS: There were 190 recipients in the FTR group and 245 in the control group. 
      Overall, the recipients in the control group were younger and received more blood 
      products on the day of their event and over the subsequent 10 days. The 
      alloimmunization rate among recipients in the FTR group was higher than in the 
      control group (8% vs. 3%, respectively; p = 0.026). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      preliminary data support our hypothesis that recipient inflammation may affect 
      RBC alloimmunization in humans; however, a more detailed understanding of the 
      pathophysiologic association between inflammation and alloimmunization is 
      required before definitive conclusions can be reached.
