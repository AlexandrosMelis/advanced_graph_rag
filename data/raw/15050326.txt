TI  - Does radiotherapy around the time of pregnancy for Hodgkin's disease modify the 
      risk of breast cancer?
PG  - 1474-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether the risk of secondary breast cancer after 
      radiotherapy (RT) for Hodgkin's disease is greater among women who underwent RT 
      around time of pregnancy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 382 women treated 
      with RT for Hodgkin's disease were reviewed and divided into those who received 
      RT around the time of pregnancy and those who were not pregnant. Comparisons of 
      the overall incidence, actuarial rates, and latency to breast cancer between the 
      two groups were made. Multivariate Cox regression modeling was performed to 
      determine possible contributing factors. RESULTS: Of the 382 women, 14 developed 
      breast cancer (3.7%). The increase in the overall incidence (16.0% vs. 2.3%, p = 
      0.0001) and the actuarial rate of breast cancer among the women in the pregnant 
      group (p = 0.011) was statistically significant. The women treated around the 
      time of pregnancy had a 10- and 15-year actuarial rate of breast cancer of 6.7% 
      and 32.6%, respectively. The 10-year and 15-year actuarial rate for the 
      nonpregnant women was 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively. The median latency from RT to 
      the diagnosis of breast cancer was 13.1 and 18.9 years for women in the pregnant 
      and nonpregnant groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, pregnancy 
      around the time of RT was the only variable associated with an increased risk of 
      breast cancer. The risk was dependent on the length of time from pregnancy to RT, 
      with women receiving RT during pregnancy and within 1 month of pregnancy having 
      an increased risk of breast cancer compared with nonpregnant women and women 
      irradiated later than 1 month after pregnancy (hazard ratio, 22.49; 95% 
      confidence interval, 5.56-90.88; p <0.001). CONCLUSION: The results of this study 
      indicate that the risk of breast cancer after RT is greater with irradiation 
      around the time of pregnancy. This suggests that pregnancy is a time of increased 
      sensitivity of breast tissue to the carcinogenic effects of radiation. Because of 
      the small sample size and limited follow-up, additional studies are recommended 
      to confirm these findings.
