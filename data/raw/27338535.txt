AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current risk assessment models for surgical site occurrence (SSO) 
      and surgical site infection (SSI) after open ventral hernia repair (VHR) have 
      limited external validation. Our aim was to determine (1) whether existing models 
      stratify patients into groups by risk and (2) which model best predicts the rate 
      of SSO and SSI. METHODS: Patients who underwent open VHR and were followed for at 
      least 1 mo were included. Using two data sets-a retrospective multicenter 
      database (Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative) and a single-center prospective 
      database (Prospective)-each patient was assigned a predicted risk with each of 
      the following models: Ventral Hernia Risk Score (VHRS), Ventral Hernia Working 
      Group (VHWG), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wound Class, and Hernia 
      Wound Risk Assessment Tool (HW-RAT). Patients in the Prospective database were 
      also assigned a predicted risk from the American College of Surgeons National 
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). Areas under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared to 
      assess the predictive accuracy of the models for SSO and SSI. Pearson's 
      chi-square was used to determine which models were able to risk-stratify patients 
      into groups with significantly differing rates of actual SSO and SSI. RESULTS: 
      The Ventral Hernia Outcomes Collaborative database (n = 795) had an overall SSO 
      and SSI rate of 23% and 17%, respectively. The AUCs were low for SSO (0.56, 0.54, 
      0.52, and 0.60) and SSI (0.55, 0.53, 0.50, and 0.58). The VHRS (P = 0.01) and 
      HW-RAT (P < 0.01) significantly stratified patients into tiers for SSO, whereas 
      the VHWG (P < 0.05) and HW-RAT (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In the Prospective 
      database (n = 88), 14% and 8% developed an SSO and SSI, respectively. The AUCs 
      were low for SSO (0.63, 0.54, 0.50, 0.57, and 0.69) and modest for SSI (0.81, 
      0.64, 0.55, 0.62, and 0.73). The ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.01) stratified for SSO, whereas 
      the VHRS (P < 0.01) and ACS-NSQIP (P < 0.05) stratified for SSI. In both 
      databases, VHRS, VHWG, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
      overestimated risk of SSO and SSI, whereas HW-RAT and ACS-NSQIP underestimated 
      risk for all groups. CONCLUSIONS: All five existing predictive models have 
      limited ability to risk-stratify patients and accurately assess risk of SSO. 
      However, both the VHRS and ACS-NSQIP demonstrate modest success in identifying 
      patients at risk for SSI. Continued model refinement is needed to improve the two 
      highest performing models (VHRS and ACS-NSQIP) along with investigation to 
      determine whether modifications to perioperative management based on risk 
      stratification can improve outcomes.
