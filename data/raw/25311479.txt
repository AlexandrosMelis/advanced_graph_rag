      middle-income countries?

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is uncertain whether the inverse equity hypothesis-the idea that 
      new health interventions are initially primarily accessed by the rich, but that 
      inequalities narrow with diffusion to the poor-holds true for cancer screening in 
      low and middle income countries (LMICs).This study examines the relationship 
      between overall coverage and economic inequalities in coverage of cancer 
      screening in four middle-income countries. METHODS: Secondary analyses of 
      cross-sectional data from the WHO study on Global Ageing and Adult Health in 
      China, Mexico, Russia and South Africa (2007-2010). Three regression-based 
      methods were used to measure economic inequalities: (1) Adjusted OR; (2) Relative 
      Index of Inequality (RII); and (3) Slope Index of Inequality. RESULTS: Coverage 
      for breast cancer screening was 10.5% in South Africa, 19.3% in China, 33.8% in 
      Russia and 43% in Mexico, and coverage for cervical cancer screening was 24% in 
      South Africa, 27.2% in China, 63.7% in Mexico and 81.5% in Russia. Economic 
      inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent 
      in countries with higher aggregate coverage, for both breast cancer screening 
      (RII: 14.57 in South Africa, 4.90 in China, 2.01 in Mexico, 1.04 in Russia) and 
      cervical cancer screening (RII: 3.60 in China, 2.47 in South Africa, 1.39 in 
      Mexico, 1.12 in Russia). CONCLUSIONS: Economic inequalities in breast and 
      cervical cancer screening are low in LMICs with high screening coverage. These 
      findings are consistent with the inverse equity hypothesis and indicate that high 
      levels of equity in cancer screening are feasible even in countries with high 
      income inequality.
