TI  - Is expert breast pathology assessment necessary for the management of ductal 
      carcinoma in situ ?
PG  - 265-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines include a recommendation that a pathologist with 
      expertise in breast disease review all ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) specimens 
      due to the presence of significant variability in pathologic reporting of DCIS. 
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of 
      pathologic reporting of DCIS over the past decade and to determine the current 
      impact of expert breast pathology assessment on the management of DCIS. METHODS: 
      All patients with a diagnosis of DCIS referred to a single regional cancer centre 
      between 1982 and 2000 have been reviewed. Inter-observer variability between 
      initial and secondary reports has been evaluated using kappa statistics. For each 
      case, the Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) using pathologic data obtained from 
      the initial and reviewed pathology reports were compared. The impact of expert 
      breast pathology on risk assessment and treatment was determined. RESULTS: 481 
      individuals with DCIS were referred and pathology review was performed on 350 
      patients (73%). Inter-observer agreement was high for the main pathologic 
      features of DCIS. From 1996 to 2000, secondary pathology assessments lead to a 
      change in the assessment of local recurrence risk in 100 cases (29%) and 
      contributed to a change in treatment recommendation in 93 (43%) cases. 
      CONCLUSION: Expert breast pathology assessments continue to be necessary in the 
      management of DCIS.
