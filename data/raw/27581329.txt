AB  - BACKGROUND: Measurement of basal metabolic rate (BMR) is suggested as a tool to 
      estimate energy requirements. Therefore, BMR prediction equations have been 
      developed in multiple populations because indirect calorimetry is not always 
      feasible. However, there is a paucity of data on BMR measured in overweight and 
      obese adults living in Asia and equations developed for this group of interest. 
      The aim of this study was to develop a new BMR prediction equation for Chinese 
      adults applicable for a large BMI range and compare it with commonly used 
      prediction equations. METHODS: Subjects were 121 men and 111 women (age: 21-67 
      years, BMI: 16-41 kg/m(2)). Height, weight, and BMR were measured. Continuous 
      open-circuit indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system for 30 min was 
      used to measure BMR. A regression equation was derived using stepwise regression 
      and accuracy was compared to 6 existing equations (Harris-Benedict, Henry, Liu, 
      Yang, Owen and Mifflin). Additionally, the newly derived equation was 
      cross-validated in a separate group of 70 Chinese subjects (26 men and 44 women, 
      age: 21-69 years, BMI: 17-39 kg/m(2)). RESULTS: The equation developed from our 
      data was: BMR (kJ/d) = 52.6 x weight (kg) + 828 x gender + 1960 (women = 0, 
      men = 1; R(2) = 0.81). The accuracy rate (within 10 % accurate) was 78 % which 
      compared well to Owen (70 %), Henry (67 %), Mifflin (67 %), Liu (58 %), 
      Harris-Benedict (45 %) and Yang (37 %) for the whole range of BMI. For a BMI 
      greater than 23, the Singapore equation reached an accuracy rate of 76 %. 
      Cross-validation proved an accuracy rate of 80 %. CONCLUSIONS: To date, the newly 
      developed Singapore equation is the most accurate BMR prediction equation in 
      Chinese and is applicable for use in a large BMI range including those overweight 
      and obese.
