TI  - Is the Distance Worth It? Patients With Rectal Cancer Traveling to High-Volume 
      Centers Experience Improved Outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether traveling long distances to high-volume centers 
      would compensate for travel burden among patients undergoing rectal cancer 
      resection. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether 
      operative volume outweighs the advantages of being treated locally by comparing 
      the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer treated at local, low-volume centers 
      versus far, high-volume centers. DESIGN: This was a population-based study. 
      SETTINGS: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with rectal 
      cancer. PATIENTS: Patients with stage II or III rectal cancer who underwent 
      surgical resection between 2006 and 2012 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      The outcomes of interest were margins, lymph node yield, receipt of neoadjuvant 
      chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy, readmission within 30 days, 30-day and 
      90-day mortality, and 5-year overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 18,605 
      patients met inclusion criteria; 2067 patients were in the 
      long-distance/high-volume group and 1362 in the short-distance/low-volume group. 
      The median travel distance was 62.6 miles for the long-distance/high-volume group 
      and 2.3 miles for the short-distance/low-volume group. Patients who were younger, 
      white, privately insured, and stage III were more likely to have traveled to a 
      high-volume center. When controlled for patient factors, stage, and hospital 
      factors, patients in the short-distance/low-volume group had lower odds of a 
      lymph node yield >/=12 (OR = 0.51) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR = 0.67) and 
      higher 30-day (OR = 3.38) and 90-day mortality (OR = 2.07) compared with those in 
      the long-distance/high-volume group. The short-distance/low-volume group had a 
      34% high risk of overall mortality at 5 years compared with the 
      long-distance/high-volume group. LIMITATIONS: We lacked data regarding patient 
      and physician decision making and surgeon-specific factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results indicate that when controlled for patient, tumor, and hospital factors, 
      patients who traveled a long distance to a high-volume center had improved lymph 
      node yield, neoadjuvant chemoradiation receipt, and 30- and 90-day mortality 
      compared with those who traveled a short distance to a low-volume center. They 
      also had improved 5-year survival. See Video Abstract at
