TI  - [Should circumcision be performed in childhood?].
PG  - 807-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prepuce development and retractibility in a group of boys. 
      To point out the value of circumcision and prepucial forced dilation during 
      childhood. METHODS: Prepuce development and retractibility were evaluated in 400 
      boys ages between 0-16 year old. RESULTS: In boys under 1 year prepuce 
      retractibility (assessed only in children who did not undergo forced dilation 
      previously) was type I (non retractile) in 71.5% whereas type V (completely 
      retractile) was only 5.5%. In adolescent boys type I prepuce was observed in 1 
      boy only, 1.6%, whereas type V was observed in 82.3%. Furthermore, it was 
      observed that at the time of examination for the study 106 boys who had undergone 
      forced dilation at an earlier age had balano-prepucial adhesions again, which 
      demonstrates that prepuce adheres again to glans penis in many boys after a 
      forced dilation is performed. Only 11 boys were considered in need for 
      circumcision, three of them for prepucial orifice stenosis, which prevented 
      normal micturition, causing a prepucial sac, one case due to a constrictive ring 
      below the prepucial edge that would have prevented ulterior retractability, two 
      cases with repetitive balanopostitis, and five cases secondary to xerosol 
      balanitis, accounting for 2.7% of all examined boys. CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete 
      separation between prepuce and glans penis is normal and common among new-borns, 
      progressing until adolescence to spontaneous separation, at which time it is 
      complete in the majority of boys. Accordingly to the criteria we have sustained 
      for years and present study's findings, circumcision has few indications during 
      childhood, as well as forced prepucial dilation.
