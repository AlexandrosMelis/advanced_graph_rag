TI  - Is minilaparoscopic inguinal hernia repair feasible? A preliminary experience.
PG  - 294-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopy has rapidly emerged as the preferred surgical approach 
      to a number of different diseases because it allows for a correct diagnosis and 
      proper treatment. It seems to be moving toward the use of mini-instruments (5 mm 
      or less in diameter). The aim of this paper is to illustrate retrospectively the 
      results of an initial experience of minilaparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal 
      (miniTAPP) repair of groin hernia defects performed at two institutions. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between February 2000 and December 2003, a total of 303 
      patients (mean age, 45 years) underwent a miniTAPP procedure: 213 patients 
      (70.2%) were operated on bilaterally and 90 (28.7%) for a unilateral defect, with 
      a total of 516 hernia defects repaired. The primary endpoint was the feasibility 
      rate for miniTAPP. The secondary endpoint was the incidence of mini-TAPP-related 
      complications. RESULTS: No conversions to laparoscopy or an anterior open 
      approach were required. There were no major complications, while minor 
      complications ranged as high as 0.3%. CONCLUSION: While limited by its 
      retrospective design, the present study indicates that the minilaparoscopic 
      approach to groin hernia repair is safe and effective, making miniTAPP a 
      challenging alternative to laparoscopy in the approach to groin hernia repair.
