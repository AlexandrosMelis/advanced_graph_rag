AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess pain-related attentional biases among individuals with 
      episodic migraine. BACKGROUND: Prior studies have examined whether chronic pain 
      patients selectively attend to pain-related stimuli in the environment, but these 
      studies have produced largely mixed findings and focused primarily on patients 
      with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Limited research has implicated attentional 
      biases among chronic headache patients, but no studies have been conducted among 
      episodic migraineurs, who comprise the overwhelming majority of the migraine 
      population. METHODS: This was a case-control, experimental study. Three hundred 
      and eight participants (mean age = 19.2 years [standard deviation = 3.3]; 69.5% 
      female; 36.4% minority), consisting of 84 episodic migraineurs, diagnosed in 
      accordance with International Classification of Headache Disorders (2(nd) 
      edition) criteria using a structured diagnostic interview, and 224 non-migraine 
      controls completed a computerized dot probe task to assess attentional bias 
      toward headache-related pictorial stimuli. The task consisted of 192 trials and 
      utilized 2 emotional-neutral stimulus pairing conditions (headache-neutral and 
      happy-neutral). RESULTS: No within-group differences for reaction time latencies 
      to headache vs happy conditions were found among those with episodic migraine or 
      among the non-migraine controls. Migraine status was unrelated to attentional 
      bias indices for both headache (F [1,306] = 0.56, P = .45) and happy facial 
      stimuli (F [1,306] = 0.37, P = .54), indicating a lack of between-group 
      differences. Lack of within- and between-group differences was confirmed with 
      repeated measures analysis of variance. CONCLUSIONS: In light of the large sample 
      size and prior pilot testing of presented images, results suggest that episodic 
      migraineurs do not differentially attend to headache-related facial stimuli. 
      Given modest evidence of attentional biases among chronic headache samples, these 
      findings suggest potential differences in attentional processing between chronic 
      and episodic headache subforms.
