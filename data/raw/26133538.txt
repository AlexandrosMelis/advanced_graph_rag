AB  - OBJECTIVE: Abdominal bloating is reported by a majority of irritable bowel 
      syndrome (IBS) patients. Excess colonic fermentation may cause gaseous symptoms. 
      Several foodstuffs contain oligosaccharides with an alpha-galactosidic linkage that 
      is resistant to mammalian hydrolases. Assisted hydrolysis by exogenous 
      alpha-galactosidase enzyme (AG) could offer a way of controlling IBS symptoms by 
      reducing colonic fermentation and gas production. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the effect of AG on symptom severity and quality of life in IBS patients 
      with abdominal bloating or flatulence. METHODS: A total of 125 subjects with IBS 
      received AG or placebo at meals for 12 weeks. IBS-Symptom Severity Score 
      (IBS-SSS) and quality of life (QoL) were assessed at baseline, during the 
      treatment and at 4-week follow-up. RESULTS: AG showed a trend toward a more 
      prominent decrease in IBS-SSS. The responder rate at week 16 was higher for the 
      AG group. No difference was detected in QoL between AG and placebo groups. A 
      total of 25 patients (18 in AG group and 7 in placebo group, p = 0.016) withdrew 
      from the study. Abdominal pain and diarrhea were more often reported as reason 
      for withdrawal in AG group. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence to support the use 
      of AG routinely in IBS patients. Improvement of clinical response at 4-week 
      follow-up may suggest a long-term effect of unknown mechanism, but could also be 
      attributed to non-responder drop out. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects may be a 
      coincidence in this study, but irritation of GI tract by AG administration cannot 
      be excluded.
