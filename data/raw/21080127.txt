TI  - Can implant retention be recommended for treatment of infected TKA?
PG  - 961-9
LID - 10.1007/s11999-010-1679-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retention treatment is reportedly associated with lower infection 
      control rates than two-stage revision. However, the studies on which this 
      presumption are based depend on comparisons of historical rather than concurrent 
      controls. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We (1) asked whether the infection control rates, 
      number of additional procedures, length of hospital stay, and treatment duration 
      differed between implant retention and two-stage revision treatment; and (2) 
      identified risk factors that can contribute to failure of infection control. 
      METHODS: We reviewed the records of 60 patients treated for 64 infected TKA from 
      2002 to 2007. Twenty-eight patients (32 knees) underwent debridement with 
      retention of component, and 32 patients (32 knees) were treated with component 
      removal and two-stage revision surgery. We determined patients' demographics, 
      type of infection, causative organisms, and outcome of treatment. Mean followup 
      was 36 months (range, 12-84 months). RESULTS: Infection control rate was 31% in 
      retention and 59% in the removal group after initial surgical treatment, and 81% 
      and 91% at latest followup, respectively. Treatment duration was shorter in the 
      retention group and there was no difference in number of additional surgeries and 
      length of hospital stay. Type of treatment (retention versus removal) was the 
      only factor associated with infection control; subgroup analysis in the retention 
      group showed Staphylococcus aureus infection and polyethylene nonexchange as 
      contributing factors for failure of infection control. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      initial infection control rate was substantially lower in the retention group 
      than the removal group, final results were comparable at latest followup. We 
      believe retention treatment can be selectively considered for non-S. aureus 
      infection, and when applied in selected patients, polyethylene exchange should be 
      performed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study. See the Guidelines 
      for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.
