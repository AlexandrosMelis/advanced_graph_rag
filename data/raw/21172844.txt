TI  - Does TDP-43 type confer a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TDP-43 type is associated with distinct patterns 
      of brain atrophy on MRI in subjects with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal 
      lobar degeneration (FTLD). METHODS: In this case-control study, we identified all 
      subjects with a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD with TDP-43 immunoreactive 
      inclusions (FTLD-TDP) and at least one volumetric head MRI scan (n = 42). In each 
      case we applied published criteria for subclassification of FTLD-TDP into 
      FTLD-TDP types 1-3. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare subjects with 
      each of the different FTLD-TDP types to age- and gender-matched normal controls 
      (n = 30). We also assessed different pathologic and genetic variants within, and 
      across, the different types. RESULTS: Twenty-two subjects were classified as 
      FTLD-TDP type 1, 9 as type 2, and 11 as type 3. We identified different patterns 
      of atrophy across the types with type 1 showing frontotemporal and parietal 
      atrophy, type 2 predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 
      predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Within the FTLD-TDP type 1 group, those 
      with a progranulin mutation had significantly more lateral temporal lobe atrophy 
      than those without. All type 2 subjects were diagnosed with semantic dementia. 
      Subjects with a pathologic diagnosis of FTLD with motor neuron degeneration had a 
      similar pattern of atrophy, regardless of whether they were type 1 or type 3. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although there are different patterns of atrophy across the 
      different FTLD-TDP types, it appears that genetic and pathologic factors may also 
      affect the patterns of atrophy.
