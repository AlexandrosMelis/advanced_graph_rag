      delivery of cognitive processing therapy for PTSD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Various factors contribute to the effective implementation of 
      evidence-based treatments (EBTs). In this study, cognitive processing therapy 
      (CPT) was administered in a Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD) specialty clinic in which training and supervision were provided following 
      VA implementation guidelines. The aim was to (a) estimate the proportion of 
      variability in outcome attributable to therapists and (b) identify 
      characteristics of those therapists who produced better outcomes. METHOD: We used 
      an archival database of veterans (n = 192) who completed 12 sessions of CPT by 
      therapists (n = 25) who were trained by 2 nationally recognized trainers, 1 of 
      whom also provided weekly group supervision. Multilevel modeling was used to 
      estimate therapist effects, with therapists treated as a random factor. The 
      supervisor was asked to retrospectively rate each therapist in terms of perceived 
      effectiveness based on supervision interactions. Using single case study design, 
      the supervisor was interviewed to determine what criteria she used to rate the 
      therapists and emerging themes were coded. RESULTS: When initial level of 
      severity on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; McDonald & Calhoun, 2010; Weathers, Litz, 
      Herman, Huska, & Keane, 1993) was taken into account, approximately 12% of the 
      variability in the PCL at the end of treatment was due to therapists. The 
      trainer, blind to the results, identified the following characteristics and 
      actions of effective therapists: effectively addressing patient avoidance, 
      language used in supervision, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to 
      develop a strong therapeutic alliance. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the 
      growing body of literature documenting the importance of the individual therapist 
      as an important factor in the change process.
