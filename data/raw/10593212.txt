TI  - Does loss of consciousness predict neuropsychological decrements after 
      concussion?
PG  - 193-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the importance of loss of consciousness (LOC) in 
      predicting neuropsychological test performance in a large sample of patients with 
      head injury. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of neuropsychological test results 
      for patients who suffered traumatic LOC, no LOC, or uncertain LOC. SETTING: 
      Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. PATIENTS: The total number 
      of patients included in this study was 383. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Neuropsychological test measures, including the visual reproduction, digit span, 
      and logical memory subtests of the Wechsler memory scale (revised), the Trail 
      Making test, Wisconsin Card Sorting test, Hopkins Verbal Learning test, 
      Controlled Oral Word Association, and the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia test 
      (GOAT). RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the LOC, no LOC, 
      or uncertain LOC groups for any of the neuropsychological measures used. Patients 
      who had experienced traumatic LOC did not perform more poorly on 
      neuropsychological testing than those with no LOC or uncertain LOC. All three 
      groups demonstrated mildly decreased performance on formal tests of speed of 
      information processing, attentional process, and memory. CONCLUSION: The results 
      of this study cast doubt on the importance of LOC as a predictor of 
      neuropsychological test performance during the acute phase of recovery from mild 
      traumatic brain injury. Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to 
      be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury 
      (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship 
      between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with 
      mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC 
      in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for 
      the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play 
      decisions. Continued research is necessary to determine the relative importance 
      of markers of concussion in athletes.
