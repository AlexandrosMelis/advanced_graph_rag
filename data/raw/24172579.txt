TI  - Does sex influence the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke?: 
      answers from safe implementation of treatments in Stroke-International Stroke 
      Thrombolysis Register.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Women are more likely to have a worse outcome after an 
      acute stroke than men. Some studies have suggested that women also benefit less 
      from intravenous thrombolysis after an acute ischemic stroke, but others found no 
      sex differences in safety and efficacy. We aimed to evaluate differences in 
      3-month outcome between sexes in intravenous tissue-type plasminogen 
      activator-treated patients registered in the Safe Implementation of Treatments in 
      Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register. METHODS: A total of 45 079 
      patients treated with intravenous alteplase were recorded from 2002 to 2011. Main 
      outcome measures were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, functional 
      independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2), and mortality at 3 months. 
      RESULTS: Among 25 777 (57.2%) men and 19 302 (42.8%) women, we found no 
      difference in the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (P=0.13), a 
      significantly higher likelihood of functional independence at 3 months in men 
      (P<0.0001) and a higher mortality in women when compared with men (P<0.00001). 
      After adjustment for confounding variables, we did not observe any difference 
      between sexes in functional outcome (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 
      0.97-1.09; P=0.39), whereas male sex was related to a higher risk of mortality 
      (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.29; P=0.00003) and symptomatic 
      intracerebral hemorrhage (odds ratio, 1.25, 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.51; 
      P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Data from Safe Implementation of Treatments in 
      Stroke-International Stroke Thrombolysis Register suggest that intravenous 
      thrombolysis may modify the observed survival and recovery advantage for men 
      expected in the natural course of an ischemic stroke, with a possible larger 
      beneficial treatment effect in women when compared with men.
