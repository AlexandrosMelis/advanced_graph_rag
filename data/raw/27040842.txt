AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the dimensions of compensatory hypertrophy of the middle 
      turbinate in patients with nasal septal deviation, before and after septoplasty. 
      METHODS: The mucosal and bony structures of the middle turbinate and the angle of 
      the septum were measured using radiological analysis before septoplasty and at 
      least one year after septoplasty. All pre- and post-operative measurements of the 
      middle turbinate were compared using the paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon rank 
      sum test. RESULTS: The dimensions of bony and mucosal components of the middle 
      turbinate on concave and convex sides of the septum were not significantly 
      changed by septoplasty. There was a significant negative correlation after 
      septoplasty between the angle of the septum and the middle turbinate total area 
      on the deviated side (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: The present study findings suggest 
      that compensatory hypertrophy of the middle turbinate is not affected by 
      septoplasty, even after one year.
