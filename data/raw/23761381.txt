AB  - BACKGROUND: Testosterone measurement by liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is well accepted as the preferred technique for the 
      analysis of testosterone. Variation is seen between assays and this may be due to 
      differences in calibration as commercial calibrators for this assay are not 
      readily available. We investigated the effects calibration in routine clinical 
      LC-MS/MS assays. METHODS: All LC-MS/MS users that were registered with the 
      UKNEQAS external quality assurance scheme for testosterone were invited to take 
      part in the study. A set of seven serum samples and serum-based calibrators were 
      sent to all laboratories that expressed an interest. The laboratories were 
      instructed to analyse all samples using there own calibrators and return the 
      results and a method questionnaire for analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen laboratories 
      took part in the study. There was no consensus on supplier of testosterone or 
      matrix for the preparation of calibrators and all were prepared in-house. Also, a 
      wide variety of mass spectrometers, internal standards, chromatography conditions 
      and sample extractions were used. The variation in results did not improve when 
      the results were corrected with a common calibrator. CONCLUSIONS: The variation 
      in results obtained could not be attributed to variations in calibrators. The 
      differences in methodologies between laboratories must be the reason for this 
      variation.
