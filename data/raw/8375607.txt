TI  - Is the breast best for children with a family history of atopy? The relation 
      between way of feeding and early childhood morbidity.
PG  - 471-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported that breast-feeding protects children 
      against a variety of diseases, but these studies were generally conducted on 
      "high-risk" or hospitalized children. This paper describes the results of our 
      study on the effects of breast-feeding on rate of illness in normal children with 
      a family history of atopy. METHODS: A historic cohort approach of 794 children 
      with a family history of atopy was used to assess the effects of breast-feeding 
      on illness rates. Family history of atopy was based on allergic diseases in 
      family members as registered by the family physician. Illness data from birth 
      onwards were available from the Continuous Morbidity Registration of the 
      Department of Family Medicine. Information on breast-feeding was collected by 
      postal questionnaire. We then compared rates of illness between children with a 
      family history of atopy who were and who were not breast-fed. RESULTS: 
      Breast-feeding was related to lower levels of childhood illness both in the first 
      and the first three years of life. In the first year of life they had fewer 
      episodes of gastroenteritis, lower respiratory tract infections, and digestive 
      tract disorders. Over the next three years of life they had fewer respiratory 
      tract infections and skin infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a 
      protective effect of breast-feeding among children with a family history of atopy 
      that is not confined to the period of breast-feeding but continues during the 
      first three years of life. Breast-feeding should be promoted in children with a 
      family history of atopy.
