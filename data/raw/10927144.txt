TI  - Can p53 alterations be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative 
      chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer?
PG  - 239-44
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine whether p53 tumour suppressor gene alterations can be used to 
      predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiation in locally advanced 
      rectal cancer in terms of reduction in tumour size and local failure. METHODS: 
      p53 alterations were studied in pre-treatment biopsy specimens of rectal 
      carcinomas from 48 patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain 
      reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) gene mutation 
      analysis. Pre-operative pelvic radiotherapy was delivered with four fields, 45 Gy 
      to the ICRU point in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. A radio-sensitising dose of 
      5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2)) was delivered concurrently for 6 days of the 5-week 
      schedule (days 1, 2, 3 and days 22, 23 and 24). Total meso-rectal excision was 
      planned 4 to 6 weeks from completion of pre-operative treatment. Response to 
      therapy was assessed by macroscopic measurement of the surgical specimen by a 
      pathologist who was unaware of the pre-treatment tumour size or of the p53 
      status. RESULTS: IHC evidence of p53 protein accumulation was found in 40% of 
      tumours, p53 gene mutation in 35% and p53 alteration (either or both changes) in 
      46%. The average reduction in tumour size was 53% in the group with 'wild-type' 
      p53 (IHC-/SSCP-) and 63% in the group with altered p53 (either IHC+ or SSCP+; 
      P=0.18). No significant differences in tumour size reduction or local failure 
      were observed in the groups with p53 overexpression or p53 mutation compared with 
      normal. CONCLUSIONS: p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a 
      clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy 
      in advanced rectal carcinoma.
