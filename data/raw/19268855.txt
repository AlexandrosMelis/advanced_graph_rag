TI  - Application of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in MR-mammography (MRM): do we 
      really need whole lesion time curve distribution analysis?

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The identification of the most suspect enhancing part 
      of a lesion is regarded as a major diagnostic criterion in dynamic magnetic 
      resonance mammography. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) software allows the 
      semi-automatic analysis of the kinetic characteristics of complete enhancing 
      lesions, providing additional information about lesion vasculature. The 
      diagnostic value of this information has not yet been quantified. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Consecutive patients from routine diagnostic studies (1.5 T, 0.1 mmol 
      gadopentetate dimeglumine, dynamic gradient-echo sequences at 1-minute intervals) 
      were analyzed prospectively using CAD. Dynamic sequences were processed and 
      reduced to a parametric map. Curve types were classified by initial signal 
      increase (not significant, intermediate, and strong) and the delayed time course 
      of signal intensity (continuous, plateau, and washout). Lesion enhancement was 
      measured using CAD. The most suspect curve, the curve-type distribution 
      percentage, and combined dynamic data were compared. Statistical analysis 
      included logistic regression analysis and receiver-operating characteristic 
      analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with 46 malignant and 44 benign lesions 
      were enrolled. On receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the most suspect 
      curve showed diagnostic accuracy of 76.7 +/- 5%. In comparison, the curve-type 
      distribution percentage demonstrated accuracy of 80.2 +/- 4.9%. Combined dynamic 
      data had the highest diagnostic accuracy (84.3 +/- 4.2%). These differences did 
      not achieve statistical significance. With appropriate cutoff values, sensitivity 
      and specificity, respectively, were found to be 80.4% and 72.7% for the most 
      suspect curve, 76.1% and 83.6% for the curve-type distribution percentage, and 
      78.3% and 84.5% for both parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of whole-lesion 
      dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance 
      backs up this finding.
