TI  - Menopausal hormone therapy and irregular endometrial bleeding: a potential role 
      for uterine natural killer cells?
PG  - 5528-35
AB  - CONTEXT: Irregular bleeding affects many users of combined menopausal hormone 
      therapy (HT) and commonly leads to invasive and expensive investigations to 
      exclude underlying malignancy. In most cases no abnormality is found. OBJECTIVE: 
      The main objective of this study was to explore the role of uterine natural 
      killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15 in irregular bleeding in 
      HT users. DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study conducted between 
      2002 and 2004. SETTING: The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause 
      clinic at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia. PATIENTS: Patients 
      included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT. INTERVENTIONS: Outpatient 
      endometrial biopsies were taken during and outside bleeding episodes. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (CD56+) and 
      bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact of HT exposure on 
      uNK cell populations, the relationship between endometrial IL-15 expression and 
      uNK cell populations, and killer Ig like receptor genotype in subjects with 
      irregular bleeding. RESULTS: Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly 
      increased in biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes (P < 0.001), compared 
      with HT users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also 
      seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between killer Ig 
      like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Little is 
      known about the mechanisms underlying irregular bleeding in HT users. This is the 
      first report of uNK cells and their association with regulating cytokines in 
      postmenopausal endometrium and demonstrates a possible mechanism by which HT may 
      induce irregular bleeding.
