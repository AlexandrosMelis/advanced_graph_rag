TI  - Remote ischemic postconditioning: does it protect against ischemic damage in 
      percutaneous coronary revascularization? justification and design of a randomized 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Myocardial damage that is associated with percutaneous coronary 
      intervention (PCI) partially affects the results of the procedure, and is related 
      to medium-term cardiovascular death. Remote postischemic conditioning might 
      reduce the myocardial lesions that are associated with PCI, but perhaps less so 
      in diabetics. The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of 
      remote postischemic conditioning in patients undergoing elective PCI for stable 
      angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome with troponin <1 ng/ml at the 
      time of randomization. METHODS: This randomized single-blinded single-center 
      clinical trial involved 320 patients undergoing elective PCI who were randomized 
      to either receive three 5-min cycles of ischemia by inflation of a cuff on the 
      non-dominant arm to 200 mm Hg (remote postischemic conditioning) or to placebo 
      (uninflated cuff). The primary outcome variable was the maximum increase in 
      troponin in the first 24 h. The secondary outcome variable was readmission due to 
      heart failure or cardiovascular mortality after 1 year of follow-up. In addition, 
      a diabetic population was studied. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial evaluated the 
      possible reduction in intervention-related myocardial damage that was 
      attributable to remote postischemic conditioning.
