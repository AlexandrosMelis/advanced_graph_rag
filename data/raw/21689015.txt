TI  - Can dogs prime autistic children for therapy? Evidence from a single case study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Canine-assisted therapy has been receiving growing 
      attention as a means of aiding children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, 
      only limited studies have been done and a great deal of literature related to 
      this intervention is anecdotal. The present study aims at providing additional 
      quantitative evidence on the potential of dogs to positively modulate the 
      behavior of children with ASD. SETTINGS/LOCATION, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: A 
      12-year-old boy diagnosed with ASD was exposed, at his usual treatment location 
      (the Portuguese Association for Developmental Disorders and Autism at Vila Nova 
      de Gaia, Portugal), to the following treatment conditions: (1) one-to-one 
      structured activities with a therapist assisted by a certified therapy dog, and 
      (2) one-to-one structured activities with the same therapist alone (as a 
      control). To accurately assess differences in the behavior of the participant 
      between these treatment conditions, the therapist followed a strict research 
      protocol. The behavior of the participant was continuously video-recorded during 
      both treatment conditions for further analysis and comparison. Treatment 
      outcomes: In the presence of the dog, the participant exhibited more frequent and 
      longer durations of positive behaviors (such as smiling and positive physical 
      contacting) as well as less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors 
      (such as aggressive manifestations). CONCLUSIONS: These findings are in 
      accordance with previous experimental work and provide additional support for the 
      assertion that dogs can prime autistic children for therapy. Ultimately, this 
      study may contribute toward a change for full acceptance of canine-assisted 
      therapy programs within the medical milieu. Additional studies using a similar 
      research protocol on more autistic children will certainly help professionals to 
      work on the most effective methods to individually serve this population through 
      canine-assisted interventions.
