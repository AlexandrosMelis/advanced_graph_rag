TI  - Fast foods - are they a risk factor for asthma?
PG  - 1537-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lifestyle changes over the last 30 years are the most likely 
      explanation for the increase in allergic disease over this period. AIM: This 
      study tests the hypothesis that the consumption of fast food is related to the 
      prevalence of asthma and allergy. METHODS: As part of the International Study of 
      Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) a cross-sectional prevalence study of 
      1321 children (mean age = 11.4 years, range: 10.1-12.5) was conducted in 
      Hastings, New Zealand. Using standard questions we collected data on the 
      prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms, as well as food frequency data. Skin 
      prick tests were performed to common environmental allergens and exercise-induced 
      bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) was assessed according to a standard 
      protocol. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2) and 
      classified into overweight and obese according to a standard international 
      definition. RESULTS: After adjusting for lifestyle factors, including other diet 
      and BMI variables, compared with children who never ate hamburgers, we found an 
      independent risk of hamburger consumption on having a history of wheeze 
      [consumption less than once a week (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06-1.96) and 1+ times a 
      week (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.07-2.52)] and on current wheeze [consumption less than 
      once a week (OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.80-1.70) and 1+ times a week (OR = 1.81, 95% 
      CI: 1.10-2.98)]. Takeaway consumption 1+ times a week was marginally 
      significantly related to BHR (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 0.99-5.91). There was no effect 
      on atopy. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent consumption of hamburgers showed a dose-dependent 
      association with asthma symptoms, and frequent takeaway consumption showed a 
      similar association with BHR.
