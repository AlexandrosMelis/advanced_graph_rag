AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate longitudinal 
      predictors of fear of recurrence in survivors of head and neck cancer (HNC) using 
      Leventhal's Common Sense Model (CSM) as a framework. The research questions were 
      as follows: (a) to what extent do HNC patients report fear of cancer recurrence? 
      (b) To what extent are fears of recurrence manifestations of illness-related 
      anxiety? (c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, 
      disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic 
      factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence? 
      METHODS: A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 
      newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed 
      measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and 
      depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of 
      recurrence only). RESULTS: A third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported 
      relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar 
      levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related 
      to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and 
      educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors. Path 
      analyses demonstrated that fears of cancer recurrence after treatment were 
      directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism. CONCLUSION: Although 
      components of the CSM (cognitive and emotional representations, coping 
      strategies) were associated with fears of recurrence, optimism was found to be 
      the strongest predictor of fear, independent of anxiety and level of fear 
      reported prior to treatment.
