TI  - Preoperative staging of patients with liver metastases of colorectal carcinoma. 
      Does PET/CT really add something to multidetector CT?

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine prospectively whether the 
      systematic use of PET/CT associated with conventional techniques could improve 
      the accuracy of staging in patients with liver metastases of colorectal 
      carcinoma. We also assessed the impact on the therapeutic strategy. METHODS: 
      Between 2006 and 2008, 97 patients who were evaluated for resection of LMCRC were 
      prospectively enrolled. Preoperative workup included multidetector-CT (MDCT) and 
      PET/CT. In 11 patients with liver steatosis or iodinated contrast allergy, MR 
      also was performed. Sixty-eight patients underwent laparotomy. Sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values for 
      hepatic and extrahepatic staging of MDCT and PET-CT were calculated. RESULTS: In 
      a lesion-by-lesion analysis of the hepatic staging, the sensitivity of MDCT/RM 
      was superior to PET/CT (89.2 vs. 55%, p < 0.001). On the extrahepatic staging, 
      PET/CT was superior to MDCT/MR only for the detection of locoregional recurrence 
      (p = 0.03) and recurrence in uncommon sites (p = 0.016). New findings in PET/CT 
      resulted in a change in therapeutic strategy in 17 patients. However, additional 
      information was correct only in eight cases and wrong in nine patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PET/CT has a limited role in hepatic staging of LMCRC. Although 
      PET-CT has higher sensitivity for the detection of extrahepatic disease in some 
      anatomic locations, its results are hampered by its low PPV. PET/CT provided 
      additional useful information in 8% of the cases but also incorrect and 
      potentially harmful data in 9% of the staging. Our findings support a more 
      selective use of PET/CT, basically in patients with high risk of local 
      recurrence.
