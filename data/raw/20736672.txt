AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether perspective-taking, which researchers in other fields 
      have shown to induce empathy, improves patient satisfaction in encounters between 
      student-clinicians and standardized patients (SPs). METHOD: In three studies, 
      randomly assigned students (N = 608) received either a perspective-taking 
      instruction or a neutral instruction prior to a clinical skills examination in 
      2006-2007. SP satisfaction was the main outcome in all three studies. Study 1 
      involved 245 third-year medical students from two universities. Studies 2 and 3 
      extended Study 1 to examine generalizability across student and SP 
      subpopulations. Study 2 (105 physician assistant students, one university) 
      explored the effect of perspective-taking on African American SPs' satisfaction. 
      Study 3 (258 third-year medical students, two universities) examined the 
      intervention's effect on students with high and low baseline perspective-taking 
      tendencies. RESULTS: Intervention students outscored controls in patient 
      satisfaction in all studies: Study 1: P = .01, standardized effect size = 0.16; 
      Study 2: P = .001, standardized effect size = 0.31; Study 3: P = .009, 
      standardized effect size = 0.13. In Study 2, perspective-taking improved African 
      American SPs' satisfaction. In Study 3, intervention students with high baseline 
      perspective-taking tendencies outscored controls (P = .0004, standardized effect 
      size = 0.25), whereas those with low perspective-taking tendencies did not (P = 
      .72, standardized effect size = 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: Perspective-taking increased 
      patient satisfaction in all three studies, across medical schools, clinical 
      disciplines, and racially diverse students and SPs. Perspective-taking as a means 
      for improving patient satisfaction deserves further exploration in clinical 
      training and practice.
