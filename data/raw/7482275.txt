TI  - Necrotizing fasciitis: an indication for hyperbaric oxygenation therapy?
PG  - 873-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accepted treatment protocol for necrotizing fasciitis (NF) 
      consists of extensive surgery and wide spectrum antibiotics. Hyperbaric 
      oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving 
      patient mortality and outcome. However, the beneficial effect of HBO for NF 
      remains controversial. METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome 
      in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The 
      mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were 
      compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their 
      treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical 
      excision and antibiotics alone. RESULTS: The two groups were found to be similar 
      with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous 
      prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II 
      score for disease's severity on presentation. The mortality rate among the 
      HBO-treated patients was 36%, as opposed to 25% in the non-HBO group. The mean 
      number of surgical debridements required per patient was significantly higher in 
      the HBO group: 3.3 compared with 1.5 in the non-HBO-treated patients. Although 
      the average length of hospitalization for survivors was shorter for the HBO 
      group, the difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study cast doubt on the suggested advantage of 
      HBO in reducing patient mortality and morbidity when used as adjuvant therapy for 
      NF.
