TI  - Do familiar teammates request and accept more backup? Transactive memory in air 
      traffic control.
PG  - 181-92
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated factors that explain when and why 
      different groups of teammates are more likely to request and accept backup from 
      one another when needed in an environment characterized by extreme time pressure 
      and severe consequences of error: commercial air traffic control (ATC). 
      BACKGROUND: Transactive memory theory states that teammates develop consensus 
      regarding the distribution of their relative expertise as well as confidence in 
      that expertise over time and that this facilitates coordination processes. The 
      present study investigated whether this theory could help to explain between-team 
      differences in requesting and accepting backup when needed. METHOD: The present 
      study used cross-sectional data collected from 51 commercial ATC teams. 
      Hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Teammates 
      with greater experience working together requested and accepted backup from one 
      another more than those with lesser experience working together. Teammate 
      knowledge consensus and perceived team efficacy appear to have mediated this 
      relationship. CONCLUSION: Transactive memory theory extends to high-stress 
      environments in which members' expertise is highly overlapping. Teammates' shared 
      mental models about one another increase the likelihood that they will request 
      and accept backup. APPLICATION: Teammate familiarity should be considered when 
      choosing among potential replacement team members. Training strategies that 
      accelerate the development of teammate knowledge consensus and team efficacy are 
      warranted.
