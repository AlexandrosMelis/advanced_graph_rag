TI  - Does rural or urban residence make a difference to neonatal outcome in premature 
      birth? A regional study in Australia.
PG  - F251-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients living in rural areas may be at a disadvantage in accessing 
      tertiary health care. AIM: To test the hypothesis that very premature infants 
      born to mothers residing in rural areas have poorer outcomes than those residing 
      in urban areas in the state of New South Wales (NSW) and the Australian Capital 
      Territory (ACT) despite a coordinated referral and transport system. METHODS: 
      "Rural" or "urban" status was based on the location of maternal residence. 
      Perinatal characteristics, major morbidity and case mix adjusted mortality were 
      compared between 1879 rural and 6775 urban infants <32 weeks gestational age, 
      born in 1992-2002 and admitted to all 10 neonatal intensive care units in NSW and 
      ACT. RESULTS: Rural mothers were more likely to be teenaged, indigenous, and to 
      have had a previous premature birth, prolonged ruptured membrane, and antenatal 
      corticosteroid. Urban mothers were more likely to have had assisted conception 
      and a caesarean section. More urban (93% v 83%) infants were born in a tertiary 
      obstetric hospital. Infants of rural residence had a higher mortality (adjusted 
      odds ratio (OR) 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 1.48, p = 0.005). This 
      trend was consistently seen in all subgroups and significantly for the tertiary 
      hospital born population and the 30-31 weeks gestation subgroup. Regional birth 
      data in this gestational age range also showed a higher stillbirth rate among 
      rural infants (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.32, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Premature 
      births from rural mothers have a higher risk of stillbirth and mortality in 
      neonatal intensive care than urban infants.
