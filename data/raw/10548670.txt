TI  - Does the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale favor left hemisphere 
      strokes? NINDS t-PA Stroke Study Group.
PG  - 2355-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is 
      a valid, reproducible scale that measures neurological deficit. Of 42 possible 
      points, 7 points are directly related to measurement of language compared with 
      only 2 points related to neglect. METHODS: We examined the placebo arm of the 
      NINDS t-PA stroke trial to test the hypothesis that the total volume of cerebral 
      infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes would be greater than the 
      volume of cerebral infarction in patients with left hemisphere strokes who have 
      similar NIHSS scores. The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image 
      analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. 
      Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed 
      lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of 
      stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to 
      determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume. RESULTS: The 
      volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for 
      left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 
      5-point category of the NIHSS score <20, the median volume of right hemisphere 
      strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. 
      For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score 
      of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile 
      range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) 
      for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001). The median volume of a 
      right hemisphere stroke was roughly equal to the median volume of a left 
      hemisphere stroke in the next highest 5-point category of the NIHSS. The Spearman 
      rank correlation between the 24-hour NIHSS score and 3-month lesion volume was 
      0.72 for patients with left hemisphere stroke and 0.71 for patients with right 
      hemisphere stroke. CONCLUSIONS: For a given NIHSS score, the median volume of 
      right hemisphere strokes is consistently larger than the median volume of left 
      hemisphere strokes. The clinical implications of our finding need further 
      exploration.
