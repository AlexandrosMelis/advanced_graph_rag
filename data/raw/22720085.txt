AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown associations between hyperglycemia and 
      risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality, yet glucose-lowering 
      treatment does little to mitigate this risk. We examined whether associations 
      between hyperglycemia and CVD risk were explained by underlying insulin 
      resistance. METHODS: In 60 middle-aged individuals without diabetes we studied 
      the associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour post oral glucose tolerance 
      test plasma glucose, insulin sensitivity as well as body fat percentage with CVD 
      risk. Insulin sensitivity was measured as the glucose infusion rate during a 
      euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, body fat percentage was measured by dual X-ray 
      absorptiometry, and CVD risk was estimated using the Framingham risk score. 
      Associations of fasting plasma glucose, 2-hour plasma glucose, insulin 
      sensitivity and body fat percentage with the Framingham risk score were assessed 
      in linear regression models. RESULTS: Both fasting and 2-hour plasma glucose 
      levels were associated with higher Framingham risk score (fasting glucose: r(2) = 
      0.21; 2-hour glucose: r(2) = 0.24; P<0.001 for both), and insulin sensitivity 
      with lower Framingham risk score (r(2) = 0.36; P<0.001). However, adjustment for 
      insulin sensitivity and 2-hour glucose made the effect of fasting glucose 
      non-significant (P = 0.060). Likewise, when adjusting for insulin sensitivity and 
      fasting glucose, the association between 2-hour glucose and Framingham risk score 
      disappeared (P = 0.143). In contrast, insulin sensitivity was still associated 
      with Framingham risk score after adjusting for glucose levels (P<0.001). Body fat 
      was not associated with Framingham risk score when taking insulin sensitivity 
      into account (P = 0.550). CONCLUSION: The association between plasma glucose 
      levels and CVD risk is mainly explained by insulin resistance, which raises the 
      question of whether glucose lowering per se without changes in the processes that 
      underlie hyperglycemia should be the sole clinical paradigm in the treatment of 
      type 2 diabetes or its prevention.
