AB  - BACKGROUND: The temporal pattern of the biologic mechanism linking red blood cell 
      (RBC) storage duration with clinical outcomes is yet unknown. This study 
      investigates how such a temporal pattern can affect the power of randomized 
      controlled trials (RCT) to detect a relevant clinical outcome mediated by the 
      transfusion of stored RBCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was a computer 
      simulation of four RCTs, each using a specific categorization of the RBC storage 
      time. The trial's endpoint was evaluated assuming five hypothetical temporal 
      patterns for the biologic mechanism linking RBC storage duration with clinical 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Power of RCTs to unveil a significant association between RBC 
      storage duration and clinical outcomes was critically dependent on a complex 
      interaction among three factors: 1) the way the RBC storage time is categorized 
      in the trial design, 2) the temporal pattern assumed for the RBC storage lesion, 
      and 3) the age distribution of RBCs in the inventory from which they are picked 
      up for transfusion. For most combinations of these factors, the power of RCTs to 
      detect a significant treatment effect was below 80%. All the four simulated RCTs 
      had a very low power to disclose a harmful clinical effect confined to last week 
      of the maximum 42-day shelf life of stored RBCs. CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing RCTs may 
      lack enough power to settle the issue of whether or not the transfusion of stored 
      blood has a negative clinical impact. A precautionary reduction of the maximum 
      storage time to 35 days is advisable.
