TI  - Can patient coaching reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control? 
      Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 17-24
AB  - PURPOSE: Minority patients with cancer experience worse control of their pain 
      than do their white counterparts. This disparity may, in part, reflect more 
      miscommunication between minority patients and their physicians. Therefore, we 
      examined whether patient coaching could reduce disparities in pain control in a 
      secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Sixty-seven 
      English-speaking adult cancer outpatients, including 15 minorities, with moderate 
      pain over the prior 2 weeks were randomly assigned to the experimental (N = 34) 
      or control group (N = 33). Experimental patients received a 20-minute 
      individualized education and coaching session to increase knowledge of pain 
      self-management, to redress personal misconceptions about pain treatment, and to 
      rehearse an individually scripted patient-physician dialog about pain control. 
      The control group received standardized information on controlling pain. Data on 
      average pain (0-10 scale) were collected at enrollment and 2-week follow-up. 
      RESULTS: At enrollment, minority patients had significantly more pain than their 
      white counterparts (6.0 vs 5.0, P = 0.05). At follow-up, minorities in the 
      control group continued to have more pain (6.4 vs 4.7, P = 0.01), whereas in the 
      experimental group, disparities were eliminated (4.0 vs 4.3, P = 0.71). The 
      effect of the intervention on reducing disparities was significant (P = 0.04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patient coaching offers promise as a means of reducing racial/ethnic 
      disparities in pain control. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings 
      and to explore possible mechanisms.
