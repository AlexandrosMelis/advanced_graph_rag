TI  - Does airway surgery lower serum lipid levels in obstructive sleep apnea patients? 
      A retrospective case review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is tightly linked to increased 
      cardiovascular disease. Surgery is an important method to treat OSA, but its 
      effect on serum lipid levels in OSA patients is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the 
      effect of upper airway surgery on lipid profiles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective review of 113 adult patients with OSA who underwent 
      surgery (nasal or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty [UPPP]) at a major, urban, academic 
      hospital in Beijing from 2012 to 2013 who had preoperative and postoperative 
      serum lipid profiles. RESULTS: Serum TC (4.86+/-0.74 to 4.69+/-0.71) and LP(a) 
      (median 18.50 to 10.90) all decreased significantly post-operatively (P<0.01, 
      0.01, respectively), with no changes in serum HDL, LDL, or TG (P>0.05, all). For 
      UPPP patients (n=51), serum TC, HDL and LP(a) improved (P=0.01, 0.01,<0.01, 
      respectively). For nasal patients (n=62), only the serum LP(a) decreased 
      (P<0.01). In patients with normal serum lipids at baseline, only serum LP(a) 
      decreased (P<0.01). In contrast, in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia, 
      the serum HDL, TG and LP(a) showed significant improvements (P=0.02, 0.03, <0.01, 
      respectively). In patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, the serum LP(a) 
      decreased significantly (P=0.01), with a similar trend for serum TC (P=0.06). In 
      patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, the serum TC and LDL also decreased (P=0.02, 
      0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery may improve blood lipid levels in 
      patients with OSA, especially in patients with preoperative dyslipidemia, 
      potentially yielding a major benefit in metabolism and cardiovascular sequelae. 
      Prospective studies should examine this potential metabolic effect of airway 
      surgery for OSA.
