TI  - Intravenous administration of metoclopramide by 2 min bolus vs 15 min infusion: 
      does it affect the improvement of headache while reducing the side effects?
PG  - 664-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the therapeutic effect (alleviation of vascular type 
      headache) and side effects of a slow intravenous metoclopramide infusion over 15 
      min compared with those effects of a bolus intravenous metoclopramide infusion 
      over 2 min in the treatment of patients with recent onset vascular type headache. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: All adults treated with metoclopramide for vascular type 
      headache were eligible for entry into this clinical randomised double blinded 
      trial. This study compared the effects of two different rates of intravenous 
      infusion of metoclopramide over a period of 13 months at a university hospital 
      emergency department. During the trial, side effects and headache scores were 
      recorded at baseline (0 min), and then at 5, 15, 30 and 60 min. Repeated measures 
      analysis of variance was used to compare the medication's efficacy and side 
      effects. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients presenting to the emergency department 
      met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 62 patients (51.7%) were given 10 mg 
      metoclopramide as a slow intravenous infusion over 15 min (SIG group) and 58 
      patients (48.3%) were given 10 mg metoclopramide intravenous bolus infusion over 
      2 min (BIG group). 17 of the 58 patients in the BIG group (29.3%) and 4 of the 62 
      patients (6.5%) in the SIG group had akathisia (p = 0.001). There were no 
      significant differences between the BIG and SIG groups in terms of mean headache 
      scores (p = 0.34) and no adverse reactions in the study period. Metoclopramide 
      successfully relieved the headache symptom(s) of patients in both the BIG and SIG 
      groups. CONCLUSION: Slowing the infusion rate of metoclopramide is an effective 
      strategy for the improvement of headache and reducing the incidence of akathisia 
      in patients with vascular type headache.
