TI  - Are laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein 
      hormone that exists in multiple forms. Immunoassays commonly used in clinical 
      laboratories measure intact hCG, total beta hCG (intact hCG + hCG free 
      beta-subunit), and/or hCG free beta-subunit. Measurement of serum concentrations 
      of hCG is useful for confirmation and monitoring of pregnancy, diagnosis of 
      trophoblastic diseases and monitoring of the efficacy of treatment, and prenatal 
      screening. Correctly reporting results for the various forms of hCG is clinically 
      important. METHOD: We prepared samples by addition of intact hCG and hCG free 
      beta-subunit to an essentially hCG-free human serum matrix. The samples were 
      analyzed by participant laboratories using various immunoassay methods. RESULTS: 
      We identified errors in participant reporting of intact hCG results as total beta 
      hCG (9.3%; 22 of 235 laboratories) and total beta hCG as intact hCG (13.1%; 8 of 
      61 laboratories). CONCLUSIONS: Many factors contribute to the erroneous reporting 
      of hCG results, including (a) the complexity of hCG molecule and confusion of 
      nomenclature on the various forms of hCG; (b) laboratory personnel's lack of 
      awareness of the distinctions of the forms of hCG and failure to recognize the 
      specificity of assays for their measurement; (c) lack of clarity and uniformity 
      in manufacturers' reagent labeling; and (d) most product inserts' lack of 
      information on the specificity of each method to the various forms of hCG.
