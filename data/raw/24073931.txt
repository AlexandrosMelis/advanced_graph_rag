AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, many advances in pancreatic surgery have been 
      achieved. Nevertheless, the rate of pancreatic fistula following pancreatic tail 
      resection does not differ between various techniques, still reaching up to 30% in 
      prospective multicentric studies. Taking into account contradictory results 
      concerning the usefulness of covering resection margins after distal 
      pancreatectomy, we sought to perform a systematic, retrospective analysis of 
      patients that underwent distal pancreatectomy at our center. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively analysed the data of 74 patients that underwent distal 
      pancreatectomy between 2001 and 2011 at the community hospital in Neuss. 
      Demographic factors, indications, postoperative complications, surgical or 
      interventional revisions, and length of hospital stay were registered to compare 
      the outcome of patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy with coverage of the 
      resection margins vs. patients undergoing distal pancreatectomy without coverage 
      of the resection margins. Differences between groups were calculated using 
      Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Main indications for pancreatic 
      surgery were insulinoma (n=18, 24%), ductal adenocarcinoma (n=9, 12%), 
      non-single-insulinoma-pancreatogenic-hypoglycemia-syndrome (NSIPHS) (n=8, 11%), 
      and pancreatic cysts with pancreatitis (n=8, 11%). In 39 of 74 (53%) patients no 
      postoperative complications were noted. In detail we found that 23/42 (55%) 
      patients with coverage vs. 16/32 (50%) without coverage of the resection margins 
      had no postoperative complications. The most common complications were pancreatic 
      fistulas in eleven patients (15%), and postoperative bleeding in nine patients 
      (12%). Pancreatic fistulas occurred in patients without coverage of the resection 
      margins in 7/32 (22%) vs. 4/42 (1011%) with coverage are of the resection 
      margins, yet without reaching statistical significance. Postoperative bleeding 
      ensued with equal frequency in both groups (12% with coverage versus 13% without 
      coverage of the resection margins). The reoperation rate was 8%. The hospital 
      stay for patients without coverage was 13 days (5-60) vs. 17 days (8-60) for 
      patients with coverage. CONCLUSIONS: The results show no significant difference 
      in the fistula rate after covering of the resection margin after distal 
      pancreatectomy, which contributes to the picture of an unsolved problem.
