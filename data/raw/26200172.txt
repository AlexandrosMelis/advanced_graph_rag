      performance? A practitioner's perspective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, biofeedback has become increasingly popular for its 
      proven success in peak performance training - the psychophysiological preparation 
      of athletes for high-stakes sport competitions, such as the Olympic games. The 
      aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to 
      biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over 
      competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects. 
      METHODS: Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training 
      in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes 
      (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). 
      All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, 
      was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. 
      Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress 
      tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, 
      the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then 
      calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared 
      with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin 
      conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart 
      respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we 
      questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they 
      continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement 
      in their athletic performance. RESULTS: We demonstrated that a greater number of 
      participants in the experimental group were able to successfully control their 
      psychophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peers in the control 
      group. Significant results (p < 0.05) were noted in regulation of GSR following 
      short stress test conditions (p = 0.037), in regulation of HR after exposure to 
      STROOP stressor (p = 0.037), in regulation of GSR following the Math and GSR 
      stressors (p = 0.033, p = 0.409) and in achieving HR - breathing coherence 
      following the math stressor (p = 0.042). CONCLUSION: One year following 
      completion of the training program, all participants from the experimental group 
      indicated that they were still using the biofeedback - psycho-regulation skills. 
      Furthermore, these participants uniformly reported believing that these skills 
      had enhanced their athletic performance and general well-being.
