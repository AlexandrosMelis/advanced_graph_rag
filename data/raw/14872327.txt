AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of pain and risk factors for pain in 
      psychiatric patients in a psychiatric hospital. METHODS: Using a questionnaire we 
      investigated in a cross-sectional study the prevalence of pain, duration of pain, 
      impairment and unfitness for work due to pain in 106 patients primarily diagnosed 
      with a psychiatric disorder in the field of general adult psychiatry. Potential 
      risk factors were explored. RESULTS: The point prevalence of pain was about 50%, 
      the 6-month prevalence 75.5% and the 12-month prevalence 76.5%. The patients' 
      most frequent complaints were low back pain, headache and shoulder and neck pain. 
      Patients with affective disorders most frequently had pain complaints, followed 
      by those with neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders and those with 
      psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, schizotypic and delusional disorders. 
      Almost 10% of all patients reported pain continuing at least 3 months in the past 
      year. Impairment and unfitness for work were related to specific psychiatric 
      diagnosis. Statistically significant risk factors for pain were depression 
      (OR=6.05) and the number of past admissions to psychiatric hospitals (OR=3.609). 
      CONCLUSION: We found evidence that pain can be a significant clinical problem in 
      psychiatric patients which seems to be underestimated in psychiatry. The 
      investigated patients in general adult psychiatry are characterized by specific 
      risk factors different from clinical subpopulations of other disciplines.
