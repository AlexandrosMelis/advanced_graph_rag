AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compare 30-day and 180-day postadmission hospital mortality rates 
      for all Medicare patients and those in three categories of cardiac care: coronary 
      artery bypass graft surgery, acute myocardial infarction, and congestive heart 
      failure. DATA SOURCES/COLLECTION: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) 
      hospital mortality data for FY 1989. STUDY DESIGN: Using hospital level public 
      use files of actual and predicted mortality at 30 and 180 days, we constructed 
      residual mortality measures for each hospital. We ranked hospitals and used 
      receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to compare 0-30, 31-180, and 
      0-180-day postadmission mortality. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For the admissions we 
      studied, we found a broad range of hospital performance when we ranked hospitals 
      using the 30-day data; some hospitals had much lower than predicted 30-day 
      mortality rates, while others had much higher than predicted mortality rates. 
      Data from the time period 31-180 days postadmission yield results that 
      corroborate the 0-30 day postadmission data. Moreover, we found evidence that 
      hospital performance on one condition is related to performance on the other 
      conditions, but that the correlation is much weaker in the 31-180-day interval 
      than in the 0-30-day period. Using ROC curves, we found that the 30-day data 
      discriminated the top and bottom fifths of the 180-day data extremely well, 
      especially for AMI outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Using data on cumulative hospital 
      mortality from 180 days postadmission does not yield a different perspective from 
      using data from 30 days postadmission for the conditions we studied.
