TI  - Cardiopulmonary bypass temperature does not affect postoperative euthyroid sick 
      syndrome?
PG  - 1541-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if temperature during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) 
      has an effect on perioperative and postoperative thyroid function. DESIGN: 
      Prospective study comparing thyroid function during and after hypothermic and 
      normothermic CPB. SETTING: Cardiac surgical unit at a university-affiliated 
      hospital. PATIENTS: Twelve patients scheduled to undergo cardiac operations with 
      normothermic (n = 6) or hypothermic (n = 6) CPB. INTERVENTIONS: Blood was 
      analyzed for serum concentration of total thyroxine (TT4), total triiodothyronine 
      (TT3), free T3 (fT3), reverse T3 (rT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
      preoperatively, 60 min after CPB was initiated, 30 min after discontinuing CPB, 
      and on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, and 5. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients 
      who underwent either cold (26 degrees +/- 5 degrees C) or warm (35 degrees +/- 1 
      degree C) CPB were comparable with regard to age, body weight, duration of CPB, 
      cross-clamp time, use of inotropes, total heparin dose, and length of hospital 
      stay. Incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, 
      and death were similar. In both groups, TT4 and TT3 were reduced below baseline 
      values beginning with CPB and persisting for up to 5 days after CPB (p < 0.05), 
      free T3 was reduced for up to 3 days after CPB (p < 0.05), mean serum rT3 was 
      elevated on POD 1 and POD 3 (p < 0.05), and TSH remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: 
      The results of this study suggest that normothermic CPB does not prevent the 
      development of the "euthyroid sick syndrome" during and after CPB. Despite these 
      changes in thyroid function, most patients in both groups had a normal 
      postoperative recovery.
