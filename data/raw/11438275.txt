TI  - Does patient position during liver surgery influence the risk of venous air 
      embolism?
PG  - 366-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally believed that positioning of the patient in a 
      head-down tilt (Trendelenberg position) decreases the likelihood of a venous air 
      embolism during liver resection. METHODS: The physiological effect of variation 
      in horizontal attitude on central and hepatic venous pressure was measured in 10 
      patients during liver surgery. Hemodynamic indices were recorded with the 
      operating table in the horizontal, 20 degrees head-up and 20 degrees head-down 
      positions. RESULTS: There was no demonstrable pressure gradient between the 
      hepatic and central venous levels in any of the positions. The absolute pressures 
      did, however, vary in a predictable way, being highest in the head-down and 
      lowest during head-up tilt. However, on no occasion was a negative intraluminal 
      pressure recorded. CONCLUSION: The effect on venous pressures caused by the 
      change in patient positioning alone during liver surgery does not affect the risk 
      of venous air embolism.
