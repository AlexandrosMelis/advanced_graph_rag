      in 370 Postmenopausal Women?

AB  - CONTEXT: The levels of bone formation and resorption can be assessed at the 
      tissue level by bone histomorphometry on transiliac bone biopsies. Systemic 
      biochemical markers of bone turnover reflect the overall bone formation and 
      resorption at the level of the entire skeleton but cannot discriminate the 
      different skeletal compartments. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the 
      correlations between the serum biochemical markers of formation and resorption 
      with histomorphometric parameters. DESIGN: We performed post hoc analysis of a 
      previous clinical study. SETTING: Patients were selected from the general 
      population. PATIENTS: A total of 371 untreated postmenopausal osteoporotic women 
      aged 50 to 84 years with a lumbar T-score </= -2.5 SD or </= -1 SD with at least one 
      osteoporotic fracture. INTERVENTIONS: Transiliac bone biopsies were obtained 
      after a double tetracycline labeling, and blood samples were collected. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The static and dynamic parameters of formation and bone 
      resorption were measured by histomorphometry. Serum biochemical markers of 
      formation (bone alkaline phosphatase [ALP]; procollagen type I N-terminal 
      propeptide [PINP]) and resorption (C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of 
      collagen type 1 [sCTX]) were assessed. RESULTS: The mean values of biochemical 
      markers were: bone ALP, 15.0 +/- 5.2 ng/mL; PINP, 56.2 +/- 21.9 mug/mL; and sCTX, 0.58 
      +/- 0.26 ng/mL. Bone ALP and PINP were significantly correlated with both the 
      static and dynamic parameters of formation (0.21 </= r' </= 0.36; 0.01 >/= P >/= .0001). 
      sCTX was significantly correlated with all resorption parameters (0.18 </= r' </= 
      0.24; 0.02 >/= P >/= .0001). CONCLUSION: Bone turnover markers were significantly but 
      modestly associated with bone turnover parameters measured in iliac cancellous 
      bone. The iliac crest bone may not represent perfectly the whole bone turnover.
