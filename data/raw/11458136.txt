TI  - Does managed care enable more low income persons to identify a usual source of 
      care? Implications for access to care.
PG  - 716-26
AB  - BACKGROUND: By requiring or encouraging enrollees to obtain a usual source of 
      care, managed care programs hope to improve access to care without incurring 
      higher costs. OBJECTIVES: (1) To examine the effects of managed care on the 
      likelihood of low-income persons having a usual source of care and a usual 
      physician, and; (2) To examine the association between usual source of care and 
      access. RESEARCH DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of households conducted during 
      1996 and 1997. SUBJECTS: A nationally representative sample of 14,271 low-income 
      persons. MEASURES: Usual source of care, usual physician, managed care 
      enrollment, managed care penetration. RESULTS: High managed care penetration in 
      the community is associated with a lower likelihood of having a usual source of 
      care for uninsured persons (54.8% vs. 62.2% in low penetration areas) as well as 
      a lower likelihood of having a usual physician (60% vs. 72.8%). Managed care has 
      only marginal effects on the likelihood of having a usual source of care for 
      privately insured and Medicaid beneficiaries. Having a usual physician 
      substantially reduces unmet medical needs for the insured but less so for the 
      uninsured. CONCLUSIONS: Having a usual physician can be an effective tool in 
      improving access to care for low-income populations, although it is most 
      effective when combined with insurance coverage. However, the effectiveness of 
      managed care in linking more low-income persons to a medical home is uncertain, 
      and may have unintended consequences for uninsured persons.
