TI  - Can mass drug administration lead to the sustainable control of schistosomiasis?

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the Philippines, the current national control strategy for 
      schistosomiasis is annual mass drug administration (MDA) with 40 mg/kg of 
      praziquantel in all schistosomiasis-endemic villages with a prevalence >/=10%. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of schistosomiasis was conducted in 2012 on 18 
      221 individuals residing in 22 schistosomiasis-endemic villages in the province 
      of Northern Samar. The prevalence of schistosomiasis, intensity of Schistosoma 
      infection, and morbidity of disease were assessed. RESULTS: Despite an active 
      schistosomiasis-control program in Northern Samar for >30 years, which included a 
      MDA campaign in the last 5 years, the mean prevalence of schistosomiasis among 10 
      435 evaluated subjects was 27.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.3%-28.0%), and 
      the geometric mean intensity of infection among 2832 evaluated subjects was 17.2 
      eggs per gram of feces (95% CI, 16.4-18.1). Ultrasonography revealed high levels 
      of schistosomiasis-induced morbidity in the schistosomiasis-endemic communities. 
      Left lobe liver enlargement (>/=70 mm) was evident in 89.3% of subjects. 
      Twenty-five percent of the study population had grade II/III liver parenchyma 
      fibrosis, and 13.3% had splenomegaly (>/=100 mm). CONCLUSIONS: MDA on its own was 
      insufficient to control the prevalence of schistosomiasis, intensity of 
      Schistosoma infection, or morbidity of the disease. Alternative control measures 
      will be needed to complement the existing national MDA program.
