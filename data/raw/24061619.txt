TI  - Location and number of sutures placed for hiatal hernia repair during 
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding: does it matter?

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that hiatal hernia repair (HHR) during 
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) decreases the rate of reoperation. 
      However, the technical aspects (location and number of sutures) are not 
      standardized. It is unknown whether such technical details are associated with 
      differing rates of reoperation for band-related problems. METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis was performed from a single institution, including 2,301 
      patients undergoing LAGB with HHR from July 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. 
      Independent variables were number and location of sutures. Data collected 
      included demographics, operating room (OR) time, length of stay (LOS), follow-up 
      time, postoperative BMI/%EWL, and rates of readmission/reoperation. Statistical 
      analyses included ANOVA and Chi squared tests. Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox 
      regression tests were used for follow-up data and reoperation rates, in order to 
      account for differential length of follow-up and confounding variables. RESULTS: 
      There was no difference in length of follow-up among all groups. The majority of 
      patients had one suture (range 1-6; 55 %). Patients with fewer sutures had 
      shorter OR time (1 suture 45 min vs. 4+ sutures 56 min, p < 0.0001). LOS, 30-day 
      readmission, band-related reoperation, and postop BMI/%EWL were not statistically 
      significant. Anterior suture placement (vs. posterior vs. both) was most common 
      (61 %). OR time was shorter in those with anterior suture (41 min vs. posterior 
      56 min vs. both 59 min, p < 0.0001). Patients with posterior suture had a longer 
      LOS (84 % 1 day vs. anterior 74 % 1 day vs. both 74 % 1 day, p < 0.0001). There 
      was no difference in 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and 
      postoperative BMI/%EWL. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with fewer or anterior sutures have 
      shorter OR times. However, 30-day readmission, band-related reoperation, and 
      postoperative weight loss were unaffected by number or location of suture. The 
      technical aspects of HHR did not appear to be associated with readmission or 
      reoperation, and therefore a standardized approach may not be necessary.
