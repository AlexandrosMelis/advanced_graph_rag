AB  - BACKGROUND: Ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) may require 
      adjunctive methods of substrate modification. Both ablation-targeting complex 
      fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) recorded during AF and fractionated 
      electrograms recorded during sinus rhythm (sinus rhythm fractionation [SRF]) have 
      been described. However, the relationship of CFAEs with SRF is unclear. METHODS: 
      Twenty patients (age 62 +/- 9 years, 13 males) with persistent AF and 9 control 
      subjects without organic heart disease or AF (age 36 +/- 6 years, 4 males) 
      underwent detailed CFAE and SRF left atrial electroanatomic maps. The overlap in 
      left atrial regions with CFAEs and SRF was compared in the AF population, and the 
      distribution of SRF was compared among patients with AF and normal controls. 
      Propagation maps were analyzed to identify the activation patterns associated 
      with SR fractionation. RESULTS: SRF (338 +/- 150 points) and CFAE (418 +/- 135 
      points) regions comprised 29% +/- 14% and 25% +/- 15% of the left atrial surface 
      area, respectively. There was no significant correlation between SRF and CFAE 
      maps (r = .2; P = NS). On comparing patients with AF and controls, no significant 
      difference was found in the distribution of SRF between groups (P = .74). Regions 
      of SRF overlapped areas of wave-front collision 75% +/- 13% of the time. 
      CONCLUSIONS: (1) There is little overlap between regions of CFAEs during AF and 
      regions of SRF measured in the time domain or the frequency domain, (2) the 
      majority of SRF appears to occur in regions with wave-front collision, (3) the 
      distribution of SRF is similar in patients with AF and normal controls, 
      suggesting that this may not have an important role in AF maintenance and may not 
      be a suitable ablation target.
