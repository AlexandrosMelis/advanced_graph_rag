AB  - INTRODUCTION: Poor bone quality and unstable fractures increase the cut-out rate 
      in implants with gliding lag screws. The U-Blade (RC) lag screw for the Gamma3((R)) 
      nail was introduced to provide monoaxial rotational stability of the femoral head 
      and neck fragment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the use of 
      the U-Blade (RC) lag screw is associated with reduced cut-out in patients with 
      OTA/AO 31A1-3 fractures. MATERIAL & METHODS: Between 2009 and 2014, 751 patients 
      with OTA/AO 31A1-3 fractures were treated with a Gamma3((R)) nail at our 
      institution. Out of this sample 199 patients were treated with U-blade (RC) lag 
      screws. A total of 135 patients (117 female, 18 male) with standard lag screw 
      (treatment group A) were matched equally regarding age (+/-4 years) sex, fracture 
      type and location to 135 patients with U-blade (RC) lag screw (treatment group 
      B). Within a mean follow up of 9.2 months (range 6-18 months) we assessed the 
      cut-out rate, the calTAD, lag screw migration, the Parker's mobility score and 
      the Parker's ratio at postoperatively, six and 12 months following surgery. 
      Furthermore we recorded all complications, ASA-Score, hospital stay and duration 
      of surgery retrospectively. RESULTS: The most common fracture among group B with 
      a cut-out of the lag screw were AO/OTA 2.3 and 3.2 fractures whereas in group A 
      cut-out was most commonly seen in AO/OTA 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 fractures, there was no 
      significant reduction of the cut-out rate in group B 2.2% (n=3) compared to group 
      A 3.7% (n=5). The duration of surgery was significantly shorter in group A 
      (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in lag screw placement, the 
      Parker's ratio and mobilization. CONCLUSION: In our study the U-Blade (RC) lag 
      screw did not reduce the cut-out in treatment of OTA/AO 31A1-3 fractures at all. 
      Considering the longer duration of surgery and the higher costs of the U-Blade 
      (RC) lag screw, our results do not justify its use. However, further prospective 
      randomized studies will be necessary.
