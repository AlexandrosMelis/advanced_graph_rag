AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of research emphasizes the importance of contextual 
      factors on health outcomes. Using postcode sector data for Scotland (UK), this 
      study tests the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between 
      area-level deprivation and mortality to determine if contextual differences in 
      the West vs. the rest of Scotland influence this relationship. Research into 
      health inequalities frequently fails to recognise spatial heterogeneity in the 
      deprivation-health relationship, assuming that global relationships apply 
      uniformly across geographical areas. In this study, exploratory spatial data 
      analysis methods are used to assess local patterns in deprivation and mortality. 
      Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship 
      between deprivation and mortality more formally. RESULTS: The initial exploratory 
      spatial data analysis reveals concentrations of high standardized mortality 
      ratios (SMR) and deprivation (hotspots) in the West of Scotland and 
      concentrations of low values (coldspots) for both variables in the rest of the 
      country. The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only 
      variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all 
      models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the 
      deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions 
      in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, 
      including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation 
      and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and 
      socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and 
      female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions. The 
      rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between 
      socio-economic deprivation and mortality complements prior research on the 
      stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      homogeneity we found in the deprivation-mortality relationship across the regions 
      of Scotland and the absence of a contextualized effect of region highlights the 
      importance of taking a broader strategic policy that can combat the toxic impacts 
      of socio-economic deprivation on health. Focusing on a few specific places (e.g. 
      15% of the poorest areas) to concentrate resources might be a good start but the 
      impact of socio-economic deprivation on mortality is not restricted to a few 
      places. A comprehensive strategy that can be sustained over time might be needed 
      to interrupt the linkages between poverty and mortality.
