TI  - Immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors in tissues of the 
      anal canal. Implications for anal incontinence?
PG  - 892-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: A prerequisite for a hormonal influence on anal continence in women 
      is the presence of hormone receptors in the tissues of the anal canal. Using 
      immunohistochemical techniques, we demonstrated and localized estrogen and 
      progesterone receptors (ER, PR) in tissue sections of the anal canal. METHODS: 
      Thirty-five specimens of the anorectal region from 21 patients (14 women, seven 
      men) were examined histologically for smooth muscle (present in specimens from 
      ten females and in seven males), striated muscle (present in three females and 
      five males), and perimuscular connective tissue (present in 12 females and seven 
      males). Immunostaining for ER and PR was then performed by incubating with 
      primary anti-ER and anti-PR antibody and visualization of specific antibody 
      binding by the ABC technique with DAB as chromogen. RESULTS: Positive staining 
      for ER and PR was seen exclusively over cell nuclei. Estrogen receptors were 
      found in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter of all females (10/10) 
      and in four of the seven males. Staining for ER was detected in the perimuscular 
      connective tissue of all females (12/12) and in four of the seven males. No 
      specific staining for ER or PR was found in the nuclei of striated muscle cells 
      of the external sphincter in males or females (n = 8). In females, about 50% of 
      the ER-positive tissues were also found to be positive for PR. Amongst the male 
      patients, only one exhibited staining for PR, and this was confined to the smooth 
      muscle. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of ER is a constitutional feature of the 
      connective tissue and smooth muscle cells of the anal continence organ. Estrogen 
      receptors and PR are not detectable in the striated muscle fibers of the external 
      anal sphincter in either sex. The presence of ER in the stroma and smooth muscles 
      of the anal canal suggests that these tissues are targets for estrogen. This 
      constitutes a theoretical basis for the beneficial effects of estrogen and 
      progestin replacement on anal continence in postmenopausal women.
