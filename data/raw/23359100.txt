TI  - Is etoricoxib effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after primary 
      total hip arthroplasty?

AB  - PURPOSE: Heterotopic ossification is a common complication after total hip 
      arthroplasty. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are known to prevent 
      heterotopic ossifications effectively, however gastrointestinal complaints are 
      reported frequently. In this study, we investigated whether etoricoxib, a 
      selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor that produces fewer 
      gastrointestinal side effects, is an effective alternative for the prevention of 
      heterotopic ossification. METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of oral 
      etoricoxib 90 mg for seven days in a prospective two-stage study design for 
      phase-2 clinical trials in a small sample of patients (n = 42). A cemented 
      primary total hip arthroplasty was implanted for osteoarthritis. Six months after 
      surgery, heterotopic ossification was determined on anteroposterior pelvic 
      radiographs using the Brooker classification. RESULTS: No heterotopic 
      ossification was found in 62 % of the patients that took etoricoxib; 31 % of the 
      patients had Brooker grade 1 and 7 % Brooker grade 2 ossification. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Etoricoxib seems effective in preventing heterotopic ossification after total hip 
      arthroplasty. This finding further supports the use of COX-2 inhibitors for the 
      prevention of heterotopic ossification following total hip arthroplasty.
