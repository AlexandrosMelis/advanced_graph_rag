AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to measure the accuracy and reliability of 
      normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians at making street 
      crossing decisions using visual and/or auditory information. METHODS: Using a 
      5-point rating scale, safety ratings for vehicular gaps of different durations 
      were measured along a two-lane street of one-way traffic without a traffic 
      signal. Safety ratings were collected from 12 normally sighted, 10 visually 
      impaired, and 10 blind subjects for eight different gap times under three sensory 
      conditions: (1) visual plus auditory information, (2) visual information only, 
      and (3) auditory information only. Accuracy and reliability in street crossing 
      decision-making were calculated for each subject under each sensory condition. 
      RESULTS: We found that normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians were 
      accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using 
      either vision plus hearing or vision only (P > 0.05). Under the hearing only 
      condition, all subjects were reliable (P > 0.05) but inaccurate with their street 
      crossing decisions (P < 0.05). Compared to either the normally sighted (P = 
      0.018) or visually impaired subjects (P = 0.019), blind subjects were the least 
      accurate with their street crossing decisions under the hearing only condition. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that visually impaired pedestrians can make 
      accurate and reliable street crossing decisions like those of normally sighted 
      pedestrians. When using auditory information only, all subjects significantly 
      overestimated the vehicular gap time. Our finding that blind pedestrians 
      performed significantly worse than either the normally sighted or visually 
      impaired subjects under the hearing only condition suggested that they may 
      benefit from training to improve their detection ability and/or interpretation of 
      vehicular gap times.
