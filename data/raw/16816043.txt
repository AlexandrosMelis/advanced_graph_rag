TI  - Do French lay people and health professionals find it acceptable to breach 
      confidentiality to protect a patient's wife from a sexually transmitted disease?
PG  - 414-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine under what conditions lay people and health professionals 
      find it acceptable for a physician to breach confidentiality to protect the wife 
      of a patient with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). METHODS: In a study in 
      France, breaching confidentiality in 48 scenarios were accepted by 144 lay 
      people, 10 psychologists and 7 physicians. The scenarios were all possible 
      combinations of five factors: severity of the disease (severe, lethal); time 
      taken to discuss this with (little time, much time); intent to inform the spouse 
      about the disease (none, one of these days, immediately); intent to adopt 
      protective behaviours (no intent, intent); and decision to consult an expert in 
      STDs (yes, no), 2 x 2 x 3 x 2 x 2. The importance and interactions of each factor 
      were determined, at the group level, by performing analyses of variance and 
      constructing graphs. RESULTS: The concept of breaching confidentiality to protect 
      a wife from her husband's STD was favoured much more by lay people and 
      psychologists than by physicians (mean ratings 11.76, 9.28 and 2.90, 
      respectively, on a scale of 0-22). The patient's stated intentions to protect his 
      wife and to inform her of the disease had the greatest impact on acceptability. A 
      cluster analysis showed groups of lay participants who found breaching 
      confidentiality "always acceptable" (n = 14), "depending on the many 
      circumstances" (n = 87), requiring "consultation with an expert" (n = 30) and 
      "never acceptable (n = 13)". CONCLUSIONS: Most people in France are influenced by 
      situational factors when deciding if a physician should breach confidentiality to 
      protect the spouse of a patient infected with STD.
