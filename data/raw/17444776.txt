TI  - Is the holmium:YAG laser the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter? A 
      3-year retrospective study.
PG  - 305-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the efficiency and safety of holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy for 
      ureteral stones. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 188 patients with 208 ureteral 
      stones were treated with semirigid ureteroscopy and holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy 
      from January 2003 to December 2005. Of the stones, 116 were lower ureteral, 37 
      middle ureteral, and 55 upper ureteral. RESULTS: The success rate was 92.7% at 
      the time of ureteroscopy and 96.7% at 3 months. The failures were secondary to 
      retropulsion of the stones (3.3%). There were no perforations and one stricture. 
      Stenting was done in 90% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Holmium:YAG laser is an 
      ideal intracorporeal lithotripter for ureteral calculi, with a high success rate 
      and low morbidity.
