TI  - Adults with mild intellectual disabilities: can their reading comprehension 
      ability be improved?
PG  - 835-49
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with a mild intellectual disability (ID) often show poor 
      decoding and reading comprehension skills. The goal of this study was to 
      investigate the effects of teaching text comprehension strategies to these 
      adults. Specific research goals were to determine (1) the effects of two 
      instruction conditions, i.e. strategy instruction to individuals and strategy 
      instruction in small groups in a reciprocal teaching context; (2) intervention 
      programme effects on specific strategy tests (so-called direct effects), and 
      possible differences between strategies; (3) (long-term) transfer effects of the 
      programme on general reading comprehension ability; and (4) the regression of 
      general text comprehension by the variables of technical reading, IQ, reading 
      comprehension of sentences (RCS), and pretest and posttest scores on the 
      strategies taught. METHODS: In total, 38 adults (age range 20-72 years; mean age 
      of 36 years) with ID participated in the study. IQs ranged from 45 to 69 with a 
      mean IQ of 58. The intervention programme involved 15 weekly lessons of 1 h each, 
      taught during 3 months. Blocks of lessons included each of Brown and Palincsar's 
      strategies of summarizing, questioning, clarifying and predicting, as 
      participants read and studied narrative and expository texts. RESULTS: Results 
      indicated no significant difference between group and individual instruction 
      conditions. Second, direct programme effects - as determined by posttest-pretest 
      contrasts for strategy tests - were substantial, except for the questioning 
      strategy. Third, even more substantial was the transfer effect to general text 
      comprehension. Moreover, the results on this test were well maintained at a 
      follow-up test. Finally, the variance of general reading comprehension ability 
      was best explained by the test of RCS, and only moderately by the strategies 
      trained. CONCLUSION: The presently used intervention programme provides a good 
      starting point for adults with ID to become better readers.
