TI  - Do inhaled steroids differ from cromones in terms of hospital admission rates for 
      asthma in children?
PG  - 1612-8
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics of 
      hospital admissions in two child populations receiving different types of drugs 
      as their regular medication for steady-state asthma. METHODS: Annual data on 
      children aged under 16 y treated for asthma, including consumption of regular 
      medication for asthma, numbers of hospital periods, lengths of hospitalizations 
      and annual proportions of readmissions, were collected using patient-specific 
      medical records from 1995 to 1999. In the Kuopio province, on average, 
      35.6-36.7/1000 children were on maintenance for asthma, of which 23% were 
      receiving cromones, 51% were taking inhaled steroids and 26% were treated with 
      cromones plus intermittent steroids. In the Oulu province, the respective 
      prevalence was 32.7-34.9/1000, and the respective proportions were 5%, 93% and 
      2%. RESULTS: Total and first admissions, as well as hospital days were clearly 
      less in the Oulu province. In the children aged > or = 6y, the average annual 
      total admissions were 0.3/1000 (Oulu) vs 1.2/1000 (Kuopio) (p < 0.001). 
      Similarly, the first admissions were 0.2/1000 vs 1.0/1000 (p < 0.001), 
      proportions of readmissions 6.3% vs 19.3% (p < 0.05), and numbers of hospital 
      days 0.7/1000 vs 3.8/1000 (p < 0.001). The differences were in the same 
      direction, though less prominent, also among children 2-5 y of age. CONCLUSION: 
      Our results suggest that inhaled steroids are better than cromones in preventing 
      admissions for asthma when two provinces with different practices for maintenance 
      medication of steady-state asthma were compared.
