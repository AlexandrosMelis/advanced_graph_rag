      stability?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sternal instability with mediastinitis is a very serious complication 
      after median sternotomy. Biomechanical studies have suggested superiority of 
      rigid plate fixation over wire cerclage for sternal fixation. This study tests 
      the hypothesis that sternal closure stability can be improved by adding plate 
      fixation in a human cadaver model. METHODS: Midline sternotomy was performed in 
      18 human cadavers. Four sternal closure techniques were tested: (1) approximation 
      with six interrupted steel wires; (2) approximation with six interrupted cables; 
      (3) closure 1 (wires) or 2 (cables) reinforced with a transverse sternal plate at 
      the sixth rib; (4) Closure using 4 sternal plates alone. Intrathoracic pressure 
      was increased in all techniques while sternal separation was measured by three 
      pairs of sonomicrometry crystals fixed at the upper, middle and lower parts of 
      the sternum until 2.0 mm separation was detected. Differences in displacement 
      pressures were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA and Regression 
      Coefficients. RESULTS: Intrathoracic pressure required to cause 2.0 mm separation 
      increased significantly from 183.3 +/- 123.9 to 301.4 +/- 204.5 in wires/cables 
      alone vs. wires/cables plus one plate respectively, and to 355.0 +/- 210.4 in the 
      4 plates group (p < 0.05). Regression Coefficients (95% CI) were 120 (47-194) and 
      142 (66-219) respectively for the plate groups. CONCLUSION: Transverse sternal 
      plating with 1 or 4 plates significantly improves sternal stability closure in 
      human cadaver model. Adding a single sternal plate to primary closure improves 
      the strength of sternal closure with traditional wiring potentially reducing the 
      risk of sternal dehiscence and could be considered in high risk patients.
