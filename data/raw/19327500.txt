AB  - OBJECTIVE: It remains controversial whether there is a gender difference in 
      survival of patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively analyzed 2770 patients (1689 men and 1081 women) with non-small 
      cell lung cancer who underwent pulmonary resection between 1995 and 2005 at the 
      National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo. A gender difference in survival was 
      studied in all patients, in those divided according to histology or pathologic 
      stage, and in propensity-matched gender pairs. RESULTS: There were no differences 
      in background, such as preoperative pulmonary function, operation procedures, or 
      operative mortality. The proportions of adenocarcinoma and pathologic stage I in 
      women were greater than those in men (93.6% vs 61.7% and 71.4% vs 58.6%, 
      respectively) (P < .001). Overall 5-year survival of women was better than that 
      of men (81% vs 70%, P < .001). In adenocarcinoma, the overall 5-year survival for 
      women was better than that for men in pathologic stage I (95% vs 87%, P < .001) 
      and in pathologic stage II or higher (58% vs 51%, P = .017). In 
      non-adenocarcinoma, there was no significant gender difference in survival in 
      pathologic stage I (P = .313) or pathologic stage II or higher (P = .770). The 
      variables such as age, smoking status, histology, and pathologic stage were used 
      for propensity score matching, and survival analysis of propensity score-matched 
      gender pairs did not show a significant difference (P = .69). CONCLUSION: Women 
      had better survival than men; however, there was no survival advantage in 
      propensity-matched gender pairs. A gender difference in survival was observed 
      only in the adenocarcinoma subset, suggesting pathobiology in adenocarcinoma in 
      women might be different from that of men.
