TI  - Are WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected 
      mothers appropriate in the South African context?
PG  - 164-71
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the nutritional adequacy and feasibility of 
      breastmilk replacement options recommended by WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF. The study aim 
      was to explore suitability of the 2001 feeding recommendations for infants of 
      HIV-infected mothers for a rural region in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa 
      specifically with respect to adequacy of micronutrients and essential fatty 
      acids, cost, and preparation times of replacement milks. METHODS: Nutritional 
      adequacy, cost, and preparation time of home-prepared replacement milks 
      containing powdered full cream milk (PM) and fresh full cream milk (FM) and 
      different micronutrient supplements (2 g UNICEF micronutrient sachet, government 
      supplement routinely available in district public health clinics, and best 
      available liquid paediatric supplement found in local pharmacies) were compared. 
      Costs of locally available ingredients for replacement milk were used to 
      calculate monthly costs for infants aged one, three, and six months. Total 
      monthly costs of ingredients of commercial and home-prepared replacement milks 
      were compared with each other and the average monthly income of domestic or shop 
      workers. Time needed to prepare one feed of replacement milk was simulated. 
      FINDINGS: When mixed with water, sugar, and each micronutrient supplement, PM and 
      FM provided <50% of estimated required amounts for vitamins E and C, folic acid, 
      iodine, and selenium and <75% for zinc and pantothenic acid. PM and FM made with 
      UNICEF micronutrient sachets provided 30% adequate intake for niacin. FM prepared 
      with any micronutrient supplement provided no more than 32% vitamin D. All PMs 
      provided more than adequate amounts of vitamin D. Compared with the commercial 
      formula, PM and FM provided 8-60% of vitamins A, E, and C, folic acid, manganese, 
      zinc, and iodine. Preparations of PM and FM provided 11% minimum recommended 
      linoleic acid and 67% minimum recommended alpha-linolenic acid per 450 ml 
      mixture. It took 21-25 minutes to optimally prepare 120 ml of replacement feed 
      from PM or commercial infant formula and 30-35 minutes for the fresh milk 
      preparation. PM or FM cost approximately 20% of monthly income averaged over the 
      first six months of life; commercial formula cost approximately 32%. CONCLUSION: 
      No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated 
      micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged <6 months. 
      Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional 
      needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement 
      milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, 
      preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of 
      linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals.
