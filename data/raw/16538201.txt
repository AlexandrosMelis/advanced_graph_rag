TI  - Does use of hydrophilic guidewires significantly improve technical success rates 
      of peripheral PTA?
PG  - 55-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether the use of hydrophilic guidewires has increased 
      the technical success rate of peripheral percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
      (PTA). MATERIAL/METHODS: We performed 125 procedures and analyzed the technical 
      success rates of PTA using the conventional guidewire first and then if needed, 
      the hydrophilic guidewire for iliac and SFA stenoses or occlusions. Angioplasty 
      was performed on 25 stenosed, 25 occluded iliac arteries and 25 stenosed, 50 
      occluded femoral arteries. The result was defined as technical success when the 
      lesion was crossed by a guidewire and balloon, then it was dilated with 
      restoration of vessel lumen and less than 30% residual stenosis and the rise in 
      ABI values was at least 0.15 after 24 hours. RESULTS: The technical success rate 
      after PTA of stenosed iliac arteries was achieved in 96% (24/25) using 
      conventional wires and 100% using hydrophilic guidewire; in iliac occlusions, the 
      rates were 60% (15/25) and 96%, respectively; in femoral stenosis - 84% (21/25) 
      and 100%; in occlusions in the first group: lesions <10 cm -64% (16/25) and 96%, 
      in the second group: lesions >10 cm -48% (12/25) and 88%. In the iliac group, 
      there was no significant difference in the success of iliac stenosis PTA. 
      However, there were significant changes in the success rates of PTA performed for 
      SFA stenosis and iliac and SFA occlusions. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we report an 
      overall improvement and high technical success rate for peripherial PTA. The use 
      of hydrophilic guidewires made significant difference to the technical success 
      rate of PTA, especially in occlusion and more complicated lesions.
