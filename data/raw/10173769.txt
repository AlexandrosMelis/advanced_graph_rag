TI  - Longer term quality of life and outcome in stroke patients: is the Barthel index 
      alone an adequate measure of outcome?
PG  - 125-30
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To consider whether the Barthel Index alone provides sufficient 
      information about the long term outcome of stroke. DESIGN: Cross sectional follow 
      up study with a structured interview questionnaire and measures of impairment, 
      disability, handicap, and general health. The scales used were the hospital 
      anxiety and depression scale, mini mental state examination, Barthel index, 
      modified Rankin scale, London handicap scale, Frenchay activities index, SF36, 
      Nottingham health profile, life satisfaction index, and the caregiver strain 
      index. SETTING: South east London. SUBJECTS: People, and their identified carers, 
      resident in south east London in 1989-90 when they had their first in a life-time 
      stroke aged under 75 years. INTERVENTIONS: Observational study. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Comparison and correlation of the individual Barthel index scores with 
      the scores on other outcome measures. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty three (42%) 
      people were known to be alive, of whom 106 (86%) were interviewed. The median age 
      was 71 years (range 34-79). The mean interval between the stroke and follow up 
      was 4.9 years. The rank correlation coefficients between the Barthel and the 
      different dimensions of the SF36 ranged from r = 0.217 (with the role emotional 
      dimension) to r = 0.810 (with the physical functioning dimension); with the 
      Nottingham health profile the range was r = -0.189 (with the sleep dimension, NS) 
      to r = -0.840 (with the physical mobility dimension); with the hospital and 
      anxiety scale depression component the coefficient was r = -0.563, with the life 
      satisfaction index r = 0.361, with the London handicap scale r = 0.726 and with 
      the Frenchay activities index r = 0.826. CONCLUSIONS: The place of the Barthel 
      index as the standard outcome measure for populations of stroke patients is still 
      justified for long term follow up, and may be a proxy for different outcome 
      measures intended for the assessment of other domains.
