AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Interference from irrelevant negative material might 
      be a key mechanism underlying intrusive ruminative thoughts in depression. 
      Considering commonalities between depression and social anxiety and the presence 
      of similar intrusive thoughts in social anxiety, the current study was designed 
      to assess whether interference from irrelevant material in working memory is 
      specific to depression or is also present in social anxiety disorder. METHODS: To 
      examine the effects of irrelevant emotional material on working memory 
      performance, participants memorized two lists of words on each trial and were 
      subsequently instructed to ignore one of the lists. Participants were then asked 
      to indicate whether a probe word belonged to the relevant list or not. RESULTS: 
      Compared to control and social anxiety groups, the depression groups (both pure 
      and comorbid with social anxiety disorder) exhibited greater difficulties 
      removing irrelevant emotional material from working memory (i.e., greater 
      intrusion effects). Greater intrusion effects were also associated with increased 
      rumination. LIMITATIONS: Although we included three clinical groups (depression, 
      social anxiety, and the comorbid groups), the results are based on a relatively 
      small number of participants. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that difficulties 
      removing irrelevant material from working memory might be unique to depression, 
      and the ability to inhibit irrelevant information is relatively preserved in 
      social anxiety disorder.
