TI  - Does pediatric housestaff experience influence tests ordered for infants in the 
      neonatal intensive care unit?
PG  - 704-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between the experience of pediatric 
      housestaff and tests ordered on infants in the neonatal intensive care unit 
      (ICU). DESIGN: Prospective, cohort study over one full academic year. SETTING: 
      One academic Level III neonatal intensive care nursery. PATIENTS: Data were 
      collected prospectively on all 785 infants admitted to the neonatal ICU from July 
      1993 to June 1994. These infants were cared for by 14 different categorical 
      pediatric housestaff. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our neonatal ICU has either 
      a resident or an intern on-call by himself/herself at night, affording us a 
      natural setting to compare intern vs. resident test ordering. The outcomes of 
      interest were number of arterial blood gases, radiographs, and electrolytes 
      ordered per infant by the on-call pediatric houseofficer, as tabulated the 
      morning after the call night. Control variables included the severity-of-illness 
      of the individual infant (using the Neonatal Therapeutic Intervention Scoring 
      System), the workload of the houseofficer (number of patients, number of 
      admissions), and supervision (rounding frequency and on-call attending). 
      Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call 
      night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns 
      ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per 
      infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call 
      night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night). This increase of 
      0.33 blood gases per infant amounts to interns ordering $169 more arterial blood 
      gases per call night at our institution. There was no difference between interns 
      and residents in ordering radiographs or electrolytes. CONCLUSION: Interns order 
      significantly more arterial blood gases per infant than junior and senior 
      residents on-call in the neonatal ICU. Additional study is required to see if the 
      experience of housestaff is associated with a broader array of neonatal outcomes, 
      such as morbidity and mortality.
