TI  - Are endothelial cell patterns of astrocytomas indicative of grade?
PG  - 371-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most common primary brain tumors in children and adults are of 
      astrocytic origin. Classic histologic grading schemes for astrocytomas have 
      included evaluating the presence or absence of nuclear abnormalities, mitoses, 
      vascular endothelial proliferation, and tumor necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      evaluated the vascular pattern of 17 astrocytoma surgical specimens (seven from 
      children and 10 from adults), and four normal brains obtained at autopsy, 
      utilizing antibody to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and von Willebrand 
      factor (vWF) utilizing confocal microscopy. A modified WHO classification was 
      used. RESULTS: All tumor cases showed cells positive for GFAP. Control tissues 
      showed a few, widely separated vessels. Pilocytic astrocytomas (four cases) 
      showed lacy clusters of small-to-medium sized vessels, with intact vessel wall 
      integrity. Diffuse, low grade astrocytoma (three cases) showed a staining pattern 
      similar to control tissue; intermediate grade (one case), anaplastic astrocytoma 
      (three cases) and gliobastoma multiforme (six cases) showed an increased vessel 
      density with multiple small vessels (glomeruloid clusters), some with prominent 
      intimal hyperplasia, loss of vessel wall integrity, and with numerous 
      vWF-positive single cells/microvessels within the tumor substance. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Evaluation of astrocytomas utilizing antibody to vWF and confocal microscopy aids 
      in the grading of these neoplasms.
