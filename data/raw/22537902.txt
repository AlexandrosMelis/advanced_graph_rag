AB  - BACKGROUND: Synchronous liver metastases (SLM) occur in 20% of colorectal cancers 
      (CRC). Resection of SLM and CLC can be undertaken at different centres (separate 
      management, SM) or at the same centre (global management, GM). METHODS: 
      Retrospective study of SLM and CRC resections carried out during 01/2000 - 
      12/2006 by SM or GM, using a combined or delayed strategy. RESULTS: Morphologic 
      characteristics and type of CRC and SLM resection were similar for the GM (n = 
      45) or SM (n = 66) groups. In patients with delayed liver resection (62 SM, 17 
      GM), chemotherapy prior to liver surgery was used in 92% and 38% of SM and GM 
      patients (P < 0.0001) and the median delay between procedures was 212 and 182 
      days, respectively (P = 0.04). First step of liver resection was more often 
      performed during colorectal surgery in the GM group (62 vs. 6% for SM, P < 
      0.0001) and the mean number of procedures (CRC+SLM) was lower (1.6 vs. 2.3, P = 
      0.003). Three-month mortality was 3% for GM and 0% for SM (n.s.). Overall 
      survival rates were 67% and 51% for SM and GM at 3 years (n.s.), and 35 and 31% 
      at 5 years (n.s.). Disease-free survival to 5 years was higher in SM patients 
      (14% vs. 11%, P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: GM of CRC and SLM was associated with 
      fewer procedures but did not influence overall survival. SM was associated with a 
      longer delay and increased use of chemotherapy between procedures, suggesting 
      that more rigorous selection of SM patients for surgery may explain the higher 
      disease-free survival after SLM resection.
