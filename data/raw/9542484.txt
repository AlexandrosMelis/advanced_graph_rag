AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether successful completion of the Perinatal Education 
      Programme (PEP) improves obstetric practice. METHOD: The three midwife obstetric 
      units (MOUs) in a health district of Mpumalanga were included in the study. Two 
      MOUs enrolled in the PEP and the third did not. A 'before-and-after' study design 
      was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes 
      occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected 
      at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the 
      patient had delivered. OUTCOME MEASURES: We ascertained whether the obstetric 
      history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and 
      uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether 
      appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, 
      the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, 
      evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of 
      contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate 
      actions were taken, were assessed. RESULTS: Eight of the 13 midwives at the two 
      MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case 
      notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change 
      in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The 
      obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory 
      response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 
      12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no 
      difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% 
      of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a 
      problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% 
      of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was 
      ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom 
      performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done 
      and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of 
      contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No 
      differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, 
      appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly. 
      CONCLUSION: Completion of the obstetric manual of the PEP improved the knowledge 
      of the midwives but no alteration in practice was detected.
