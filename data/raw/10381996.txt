TI  - Clinician assessment for acute chest syndrome in febrile patients with sickle 
      cell disease: is it accurate enough?
PG  - 64-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the use of empiric chest radiography (CXR) 
      is of significant value in detecting clinically unsuspected acute chest syndrome 
      (ACS) in febrile patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). METHODS: Patients with 
      SCD presenting to the emergency department and hematology clinic with temperature 
      greater than or equal to 38 degrees C were prospectively evaluated using a 
      physician-completed questionnaire. The questionnaire included inquiries into the 
      patient's physical signs and symptoms and the physician's clinical impression for 
      the presence of ACS. The questionnaire was completed before obtaining CXR results 
      in all patients. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with SCD with 96 febrile events 
      were evaluated over a 1-year period. Twenty-four percent (23/96) of the patients 
      had CXR evidence of ACS. On the basis of the questionnaire data, 61% (14/23) of 
      ACS cases were not clinically suspected by the evaluating physician before 
      obtaining CXR. Comparing the patients with and without ACS revealed that, with 
      the exception of splinting (4/23 [17%] versus 0/73 [0%]), no symptom or physical 
      examination finding helped to identify which patients had ACS. Fifty-seven 
      percent of patients with ACS had completely normal findings on physical 
      examination. The presentation of patients with clinically detected versus 
      clinically unsuspected ACS also did not differ significantly. Length of 
      hospitalization, oxygen use, and need for transfusion were the same in both the 
      unsuspected and detected ACS groups. Overall physician sensitivity for predicting 
      ACS was only 39%, and diagnostic accuracy did not improve significantly with 
      increasing levels of pediatric training. CONCLUSION: ACS is common in patients 
      with SCD who present with fever and was grossly underestimated by evaluating 
      physicians. History and physical examination appear to be of little value in 
      defining which febrile patients require CXR. In view of the mortality and 
      morbidity associated with ACS, empiric CXR should be considered when evaluating a 
      febrile patient with SCD.
