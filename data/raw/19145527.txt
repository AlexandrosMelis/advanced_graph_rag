AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study was to determine emergency medical 
      services (EMS) professionals' opinions regarding participation in disease and 
      injury prevention programs. A secondary objective was to determine the proportion 
      of EMS professionals who had participated in disease prevention programs. 
      METHODS: As part of the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians' 
      biennial reregistration process, EMS professionals reregistering in 2006 were 
      asked to complete an optional survey regarding their opinions on and 
      participation in disease and injury prevention. Demographic characteristics were 
      also collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and 99% 
      confidence intervals (CIs). The chi-square test was used to compare differences 
      by responder demographics (alpha = 0.01). A 10% difference between groups was 
      determined to be clinically significant. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 
      27,233 EMS professionals. Of these responders, 82.7% (99% CI: 82.1-83.3) felt 
      that EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention, with those 
      working 20 to 29 hours per week being the least likely to think they should 
      participate (67.4%, p < 0.001). About a third, 33.8% (99% CI: 33.1-34.6), of the 
      respondents reported having provided prevention services, with those having a 
      graduate degree (43.5%, p < 0.001), those working in EMS for more than 21 years 
      (44%, p < 0.001), those working for the military (57%, p < 0.001), those working 
      60 to 69 hours per week (41%, p < 0.001), and those responding to zero emergency 
      calls in a typical week (43%, p < 0.001) being the most likely to report having 
      provided prevention services. About half, 51.1% (99% CI: 50.4-51.9), of the 
      respondents agreed that prevention services should be provided during emergency 
      calls, and 7.7% (99% CI: 7.3-8.1) of the respondents reported providing 
      prevention services during emergency calls. No demographic differences existed. 
      Those who had participated in prevention programs were more likely to respond 
      that EMS professionals should participate in prevention (92% vs. 82%, p < 0.001). 
      Further, those who had provided prevention services during emergency calls were 
      more likely to think EMS professionals should provide prevention services during 
      emergency calls (81% vs. 51%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The majority of EMS 
      professionals thought that they should participate in disease and injury 
      prevention programs. The respondents were mixed as to whether prevention services 
      should be provided while on emergency calls, but those with experience providing 
      these services were more likely to agree with providing them during emergency 
      calls.
