TI  - Does a history of unintended pregnancy lessen the likelihood of desire for 
      sterilization reversal?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Unintended pregnancy has been significantly associated with 
      subsequent female sterilization. Whether women who are sterilized after 
      experiencing an unintended pregnancy are less likely to express desire for 
      sterilization reversal is unknown. METHODS: This study used national, 
      cross-sectional data collected by the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth. 
      The study sample included women ages 15-44 who were surgically sterile from a 
      tubal sterilization at the time of interview. Multivariable logistic regression 
      was used to examine the relationship between a history of unintended pregnancy 
      and desire for sterilization reversal while controlling for potential 
      confounders. RESULTS: In this nationally representative sample of 1,418 women who 
      were sterile from a tubal sterilization, 78% had a history of at least one 
      unintended pregnancy and 28% expressed a desire to have their sterilization 
      reversed. In unadjusted analysis, having a prior unintended pregnancy was 
      associated with higher odds of expressing desire for sterilization reversal (odds 
      ratio [OR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.79). In adjusted analysis 
      controlling for sociodemographic factors, unintended pregnancy was no longer 
      significantly associated with desire for reversal (OR: 1.46; 95% CI: 0.91-2.34). 
      CONCLUSION: Among women who had undergone tubal sterilization, a prior history of 
      unintended pregnancy did not decrease desire for sterilization reversal.
