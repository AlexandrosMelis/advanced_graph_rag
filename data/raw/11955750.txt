TI  - Does escalation of the apical dose change treatment outcome in beta-radiation of 
      posterior choroidal melanomas with 106Ru plaques?
PG  - 1360-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To show the results of treating posterior uveal melanomas with 106Ru 
      plaque beta-ray radiotherapy and to review and discuss the literature concerning 
      the optimal apical dose prescription (100 vs. 160 Gy). METHODS AND MATERIALS: 
      Forty-eight patients with uveal melanomas (median height 3.85 mm + 1 mm sclera) 
      were treated with ruthenium plaques. The median apical dose was 120 Gy, the 
      median scleral dose 546 Gy. RESULTS: After 5.8 years of follow-up, the overall 
      5-year survival rate was 90%, the disease specific 5-year survival rate was 92% 
      (3 patients alive with metastasis). Six percent received a second ruthenium 
      application, 10% of the eyes had to be enucleated. Local control was achieved in 
      90% of the patients with conservative therapy alone. Central or paracentral 
      tumors showed 50% of the pretherapeutic vision after 4 years, and 80% of the 
      vision was preserved in those with peripheral tumors. The main side effects were 
      mostly an uncomplicated retinopathy (30%); macular degeneration or scarring led 
      to poor central vision in 30% of cases. CONCLUSION: Brachytherapy with ruthenium 
      applicators is an effective therapy for small- and medium-size posterior uveal 
      melanomas. Our results are comparable to other series. The treatment outcome does 
      not seem to be capable of improvement by increasing the apical dose. An 
      internationally accepted model for defining the dosage in brachytherapy is 
      needed.
