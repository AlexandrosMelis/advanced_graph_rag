TI  - Does topical N-acetylcysteine application after myringotomy cause severe 
      otorrhea?
PG  - 22-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effect of topical N-acetylcysteine (NAC) application was 
      investigated on the healing of acute experimental tympanic membrane perforations. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty guinea pigs were used in this study. Under 
      intraperitoneal ketamine anesthesia, incisional myringotomies were performed in 
      the posterosuperior quadrant of the tympanic membranes with a straight otologic 
      hook. The diameter of the perforations was approximately 2 mm. Perforations in 
      both ears were treated with freshly prepared sponges soaked in either 0.1 ml 0.9% 
      NaCl solution (10 control animals) or 0.6 mg/0.1 ml NAC (10 animals) for three 
      consecutive days. All the tympanic membranes were examined by otomicroscopy on 
      the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth days. RESULTS: In the control group, all the 
      perforations were completely closed at the end of nine days. During the same 
      period, only 40% of the perforations were completely closed in the NAC group. The 
      remaining ears exhibited otorrhea by the third day. CONCLUSION: N-acetylcysteine 
      may cause severe otorrhea in the healing process of tympanic membrane 
      perforations. Further studies including histopathological examinations are 
      required to elucidate this condition.
