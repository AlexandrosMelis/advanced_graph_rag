AB  - BACKGROUND: The technique of induced sputum has allowed to subdivide asthma 
      patients into inflammatory phenotypes according to their level of granulocyte 
      airway infiltration. There are very few studies which looked at detailed sputum 
      and blood cell counts in a large cohort of asthmatics divided into inflammatory 
      phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to analyze sputum cell counts, blood 
      leukocytes and systemic inflammatory markers in these phenotypes, and investigate 
      how those groups compared with healthy subjects. METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective cross-sectional study on 833 asthmatics recruited from the 
      University Asthma Clinic of Liege and compared them with 194 healthy subjects. 
      Asthmatics were classified into inflammatory phenotypes. RESULTS: The total 
      non-squamous cell count per gram of sputum was greater in mixed granulocytic and 
      neutrophilic phenotypes as compared to eosinophilic, paucigranulocytic asthma and 
      healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Sputum eosinophils (in absolute values and 
      percentages) were increased in all asthma phenotypes including paucigranulocytic 
      asthma, compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Eosinophilic asthma showed 
      higher absolute sputum neutrophil and lymphocyte counts than healthy subjects 
      (p < 0.005), while neutrophilic asthmatics had a particularly low number of 
      sputum macrophages and epithelial cells. All asthma phenotypes showed an 
      increased blood leukocyte count compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005), with 
      paucigranulocytic asthmatics having also increased absolute blood eosinophils 
      compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.005). Neutrophilic asthma had raised CRP and 
      fibrinogen while eosinophilic asthma only showed raised fibrinogen compared to 
      healthy subjects (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that a 
      significant eosinophilic inflammation is present across all categories of asthma, 
      and that paucigranulocytic asthma may be seen as a low grade inflammatory 
      disease.
