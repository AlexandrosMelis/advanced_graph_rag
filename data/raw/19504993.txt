TI  - It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous?
PG  - 77-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fournier's gangrene is known to have an impact in the morbidity and 
      despite antibiotics and aggressive debridement, the mortality rate remains high. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the morbidity and mortality in the treatment of Fournier's 
      gangrene in our experience. METHODS: The medical records of 14 patients with 
      Fournier's gangrene who presented at the University Hospital Center "Mother 
      Teresa" from January 1997 to December 2006 were reviewed retrospectively to 
      analyze the outcome and identify the risk factor and prognostic indicators of 
      mortality. RESULTS: Of the 14 patients, 5 died and 9 survived. Mean age was 54 
      years (range from 41-61): it was 53 years in the group of survivors and 62 years 
      in deceased group. There was a significant difference in leukocyte count between 
      patients who survived (range 4900-17000/mm) and those died (range 
      20.300-31000/mm3). Mean hospital stay was about 19 days (range 2-57 days). 
      CONCLUSION: The interval from the onset of clinical symptoms to the initial 
      surgical intervention seems to be the most important prognostic factor with a 
      significant impact on outcome. Despite extensive therapeutic efforts, Fournier's 
      gangrene remains a surgical emergency and early recognition with prompt radical 
      debridement is the mainstays of management.
