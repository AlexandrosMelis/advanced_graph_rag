AB  - PURPOSE: To our knowledge there are no evidence-based medicine data to date to 
      critically judge the vulnerability of a solitary kidney to warm ischemia compared 
      to paired kidneys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten dogs were exposed to open right 
      nephrectomy to create a solitary kidney model (group 1). Ten dogs with both 
      kidneys were considered group 2. All dogs underwent warm ischemia by open 
      occlusion of the left renal artery for 90 minutes. Dogs were sacrificed at 
      different intervals (3 days to 4 weeks). All dogs were reevaluated by renogram 
      before sacrifice and histopathology of the investigated kidney. The 
      proinflammatory markers CD95 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were assessed using 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In group 1 clearance decreased by 
      20% at 1 week but basal function was regained starting at week 2. In group 2 
      clearance decreased more than 90% up to week 2. Recovery started at week 3 and by 
      4 weeks there was a 23% clearance reduction. Histopathological examination in 
      group 1 revealed significant tubular necrosis (60%) at 3 days with regeneration 
      starting at 1 week. In group 2 there was more pronounced tubular necrosis (90%) 
      with regeneration starting at 2 weeks. The expression of proinflammatory markers 
      was up-regulated in each group with higher, more sustained expression in group 2. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Solitary kidney in a canine model is more resistant to ischemia than 
      paired kidneys based on radiological, pathological and genetic evidence.
