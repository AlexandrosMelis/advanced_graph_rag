TI  - Is the ability to perform transurethral resection of the prostate influenced by 
      the surgeon's previous experience?
PG  - 315-20
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of the urologist's experience on the surgical 
      results and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients undergoing transurethral resection of 
      the prostate without the use of a video camera were randomly allocated into three 
      groups according to the urologist's experience: a urologist having done 25 
      transurethral resections of the prostate (Group I - 24 patients); a urologist 
      having done 50 transurethral resections of the prostate (Group II - 24 patients); 
      a senior urologist with vast transurethral resection of the prostate experience 
      (Group III - 19 patients). The following were recorded: the weight of resected 
      tissue, the duration of the resection procedure, the volume of irrigation used, 
      the amount of irrigation absorbed and the hemoglobin and sodium levels in the 
      serum during the procedure. RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups 
      in the amount of irrigation fluid used per operation, the amount of irrigation 
      fluid absorbed or hematocrit and hemoglobin variation during the procedure. The 
      weight of resected tissue per minute was approximately four times higher in group 
      III than in groups I and II. The mean absorbed irrigation fluid was similar 
      between the groups, with no statistical difference between them (p=0.24). Four 
      patients (6%) presented with TUR syndrome, without a significant difference 
      between the groups. CONCLUSION: The senior urologist was capable of resecting 
      four times more tissue per time unit than the more inexperienced surgeons. 
      Therefore, a surgeon's experience may be important to reduce the risk of 
      secondary TURP due to recurring adenomas or adenomas that were incompletely 
      resected. However, the incidence of complications was the same between the three 
      groups.
