TI  - Is first-line single-agent mitoxantrone in the treatment of high-risk metastatic 
      breast cancer patients as effective as combination chemotherapy? No difference in 
      survival but higher quality of life were found in a multicenter randomized trial.
PG  - 1717-29
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine whether patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer 
      draw benefit from combination chemotherapy as first-line treatment. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 260 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer fulfilling 
      high-risk criteria, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic 
      disease, were randomized to receive either mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) or the 
      combination of fluorouracil 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin 50 mg/m(2) and 
      cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m(2) (FEC) every 3 weeks. Treatment was continued until 
      complete remission plus two cycles, or until disease progression. In the case of 
      partial remission or stable disease, treatment was stopped after 12 cycles. 
      Second-line treatment was vindesine, mitomycin and prednisolone. Gain from 
      treatment was estimated using a modified Brunner's score composed of time to 
      progression, patients' rating of the treatment benefit, alopecia, vomiting and 
      performance status. RESULTS: After recruitment from 1992 to 1997 and observation 
      from 1997 to 1999, the final evaluation showed that single-agent treatment with 
      mitoxantrone does not differ significantly from combination treatment with FEC in 
      terms of response, objective remission rate, remission duration, time to 
      response, time to best response, time to progression or overall survival. There 
      was, however, a significant difference in gain from treatment using a modified 
      Brunner's score favoring the single-agent treatment arm. There was no evidence 
      that any subgroup would fare better with combination treatment. CONCLUSIONS: No 
      significant difference was detected between the treatment with mitoxantrone as a 
      single agent and the combination of low-dose FEC in terms of response or 
      survival; therefore, the imperative of the necessity of first-line combination 
      chemotherapy for patients with high-risk metastatic breast cancer may be 
      questioned. Since toxicity and quality of life score favored the single-agent 
      mitoxantrone treatment arm, this treatment may be offered to patients preferring 
      quality of life to a potential small prolongation of survival.
