AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports indicate that the prevalence of bipolar disorder (BD) 
      in patients with an acute major depressive episode might be higher than 
      previously thought. We aimed to study systematically all patients who sought 
      therapy for major depressive episode (MDE) within the BRIDGE study in Germany, 
      reporting on an increased number (increased from 2 in the international BRIDGE 
      report to 5) of different diagnostic algorithms. METHODS: A total of 252 patients 
      with acute MDE (DSM-IV confirmed) were examined for the existence of BD (a) 
      according to DSM-IV criteria, (b) according to modified DSM-IV criteria (without 
      the exclusion criterion of 'mania not induced by substances/antidepressants'), 
      (c) according to a Bipolarity Specifier Algorithm which expands the DSM-IV 
      criteria, (d) according to HCL-32R (Hypomania-Checklist-32R), and (e) according 
      to a criteria-free physician's diagnosis. RESULTS: The five different diagnostic 
      approaches yielded immensely variable prevalences for BD: (a) 11.6; (b) 24.8%; 
      (c) 40.6%; (d) 58.7; e) 18.4% with only partial overlap between diagnoses 
      according to the physician's diagnosis or HCL-32R with diagnoses according to the 
      three DSM-based algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of BD in patients with MDE 
      depends strongly on the method and criteria employed. The considerable difference 
      between criteria-free physician's diagnosis and the remaining algorithms indicate 
      the usefulness of criteria lists within the everyday clinical setting. 
      LIMITATIONS: Diagnoses based on DSM were only made with checklists. The diagnoses 
      of (hypo-) manic episodes in the patient history were not systematically 
      verifiable by indirect anamnesis.
