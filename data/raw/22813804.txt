AB  - PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Childhood obesity is pandemic condition. The effect of 
      obesity on trauma outcomes in children has been relatively understudied. We 
      conducted this study to ascertain the effects of obesity on the hospital outcome 
      of injured children. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients aged 2 to 
      18 years admitted to the King Abdul Aziz Medical City between May 2001 and May 
      2009 was conducted. Patients were categorized as lean (body mass index <95th 
      percentile) and obese (body mass index >/= 95th percentile). Groups were compared 
      regarding admission demographics, mechanism of injury, pattern of injury, length 
      of stay, intensive care unit admission, ventilation duration, types of procedures 
      performed, injury severity score, and mortality. RESULT: Nine hundred 
      thirty-three patients were included, of those 55 (5.89%) children were obese. The 
      obese children were older than nonobese (P = .001) and had a higher injury 
      severity score (P = .001) and a lower pediatric trauma score (P = .00), heart 
      rate (P = .0081), and respiratory rate (P = .000). There were no differences 
      between groups with regard to sex, mechanism of injury, and surgical procedures. 
      Obese children were more likely to have rib fractures (P = .02) and pelvic 
      injuries (P = .033). There was no significant association between mortality and 
      obesity (P = .42). CONCLUSION: Obesity does not seem to impact the severity of 
      injury, mortality rate, types of injury, and procedure outcomes in children. 
      Obese patients are more likely to have rib and pelvic injuries.
