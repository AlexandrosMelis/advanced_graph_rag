      foot?

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential use of a 3-phase 
      bone scintigraphy method to determine the level of amputation on treatment cost, 
      morbidity and mortality, reamputation rates, and the duration of hospitalization 
      in diabetic foot. METHODS: Thirty patients who were admitted to our clinic 
      between September 2008 and July 2009, with diabetic foot were included. All 
      patients were evaluated according to age, gender, diabetes duration, 3-phase bone 
      scintigraphy, Doppler ultrasound, amputation/reamputation levels, and 
      hospitalization periods. Patients underwent 3-phase bone scintigraphy using 
      technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate, and the most distal site of the region 
      displaying perfusion during the perfusion and early blood flow phase was marked 
      as the amputation level. Amputation level was determined by 3-phase bone 
      scintigraphy, Doppler ultrasound, and inspection of the infection-free clear 
      region during surgery. RESULTS: The amputation levels of the patients were as 
      follows: finger in six (20%), ray amputation in five (16.6%), transmetatarsal in 
      one (3.3%), Lisfranc in two (6.6%), Chopart in seven (23.3%), Syme in one (3.3%), 
      below-the-knee in six (20%), above the knee in one (3.3%), knee disarticulation 
      in one (3.3%), and two patients underwent amputation at other centers. After 
      primary amputation, reamputation was performed on seven patients, and one patient 
      was treated with debridement for wound site problems. No mortality was 
      encountered during study. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 3-phase bone scintigraphy 
      prior to surgery could be a useful method to determine the amputation level in a 
      diabetic foot. We conclude that further, comparative, more comprehensive, 
      long-term, and controlled studies are required.
