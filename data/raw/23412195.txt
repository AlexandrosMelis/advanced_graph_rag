AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to compare clinical effectiveness of operative 
      with nonoperative treatment for displaced midshaft clavicular fractures (DMCF). 
      METHODS: We systematically searched electronic databases (MEDILINE, EMBASE, 
      CLINICAL, OVID, BIOSIS and Cochrane registry of controlled clinical trials) to 
      identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which operative treatment was 
      compared with nonoperative treatment for DMCF from 1980 to 2012. The methodologic 
      quality of trials was assessed. Data from chosen studies were pooled with using 
      of fixed-effects and random-effects models with mean differences and risk ratios 
      for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. RESULTS: Four RCTs with a 
      total of 321 patients were screened for the present study. Results showed that 
      the operative treatment was superior to the nonoperative treatment regarding the 
      rate of nonunion [95 % confidence interval (CI) (0.05, 0.43), P = 0.0004], 
      malunion [95 % CI (0.06, 0.34), P < 0.00001] and overall complication [95 % CI 
      (0.43-0.76), P = 0.0001]. Subgroup analyses of complications revealed that 
      significant differences were existed in the incidence of neurologic symptoms 
      [95 % CI (0.20, 0.74), P = 0.004] and dissatisfaction with appearance [95 % CI 
      (0.19, 0.65), P = 0.001]. Lack of consistent and standardized assessment data, 
      insufficiency analysis that carried out showed improved functional outcomes 
      (P < 0.05) in operative treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence suggests 
      that the operative treatment for DMCF is associated with a lower rate of 
      nonunion, malunion and complication than nonoperative treatment. This study 
      supports traditional primary operative treatment for DMCF in active adults.
