TI  - The effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio: a better way to 
      compare different bioprostheses? A prospective randomized comparison of the 
      Mosaic and Perimount bioprostheses in the aortic position.
PG  - 382-8; discussion 388-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this prospective, randomized study 
      was to compare the hemodynamic performance of the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards 
      Perimount bioprostheses in the aortic position, and to evaluate 
      prosthesis-specific differences in valve sizing and valve-size labeling. METHODS: 
      Between August 2000 and September 2002, 139 patients underwent isolated aortic 
      valve replacement (AVR) with the Mosaic (n = 67) or Perimount (n = 72) 
      bioprosthesis. Intraoperatively, the internal aortic annulus diameter was 
      measured by insertion of a gauge (Hegar dilator), while prosthesis size was 
      determined by using the original sizers. Transthoracic echocardiography was 
      performed to determine hemodynamic and dimensional data. As the aim of AVR is to 
      achieve a maximal effective orifice area (EOA) within a given aortic annulus, the 
      ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area was calculated, the latter being 
      based on annulus diameter measured intraoperatively. RESULTS: Operative mortality 
      was 2.2% (Mosaic 3.0%; Perimount 1.4%; p = NS). Upsizing (using a prosthesis 
      larger in labeled valve size than the patient's measured internal aortic annulus 
      diameter) was possible in 28.4% of Mosaic patients and 8.3% of Perimount 
      patients. The postoperative mean systolic pressure gradient ranged from 10.5 to 
      22.2 mmHg in the Mosaic group, and from 9.4 to 12.6 mmHg in the Perimount group; 
      it was significantly lower for 21 and 23 Perimount valves than for 21 and 23 
      Mosaic valves. The EOA ranged from 0.78 to 2.37 cm2 in Mosaic patients, and from 
      0.95 to 2.12 cm2 in Perimount patients. When indexing EOA by calculating the 
      ratio of EOA to patient aortic annulus area to adjust for variables such as 
      patient anatomy and valve dimensions, there was no significant difference between 
      the two bioprostheses. CONCLUSION: Comparisons of absolute EOA values grouped by 
      the manufacturers' valve sizes are misleading because of specific differences in 
      geometric dimensions. The EOA:patient aortic annulus area ratio provides a new 
      hemodynamic index which may facilitate objective comparisons between different 
      valve types.
