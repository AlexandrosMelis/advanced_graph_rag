TI  - Production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue: a role in the 
      pathogenesis of atherosclerosis?
PG  - 2594-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular 
      disease. Although it is known that white adipose tissue (WAT) produces numerous 
      proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines and chemokines, it is unclear 
      whether adipose-derived chemotactic signals affect the chronic inflammation in 
      atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Histological examination showed that 
      perivascular WAT (pWAT) is in close proximity to vascular walls, particularly at 
      sites that have a tendency to develop atherosclerosis. In rodents, the amount of 
      pWAT is markedly increased by a high-fat diet. At a functional level, supernatant 
      from subcutaneous and pWAT strongly induced the chemotaxis of peripheral blood 
      leukocytes. The migration of granulocytes and monocytes was mostly mediated by 
      interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, respectively, whereas both 
      chemokines contributed to the migration of activated T cells. Moreover, pWAT 
      produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant 
      culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between 
      pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this 
      prochemotactic activity of pWAT. CONCLUSIONS: Human pWAT has chemotactic 
      properties through the secretion of different chemokines, and we propose that 
      pWAT might contribute to the progression of obesity-associated atherosclerosis.
