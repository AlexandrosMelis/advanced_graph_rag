AB  - PURPOSE: To assess gender differences among residents regarding their plans to 
      have children during residency and determine the most influential reasons for 
      these differences. METHOD: Using the Health Belief Model as a framework, the 
      authors created an instrument to survey 424 residents from 11 residency programs 
      at three academic medical institutions about their intentions to have children 
      during residency. The authors developed a scale to assess the perceived career 
      threats of having children during residency, evaluated its psychometric 
      properties, and calculated the effect of the mediators. RESULTS: The response 
      rate was 77% (328/424). Forty-one percent of men versus 27% of women planned to 
      have children during residency (P = .01). The instrument measured four career 
      threats-extended training, loss of fellowship positions, pregnancy complications, 
      and interference with career plans-on a five-point Likert scale. The scale had a 
      Cronbach alpha of 0.84 and an eigenvalue of 2.2. Compared with men, women had 
      higher scores for each item and a higher mean score (2.9 versus 2.1, P = .001), 
      signifying greater belief in the potential of pregnancy to threaten careers. 
      After adjusting for age, institution, postgraduate year, and knowledge of 
      parental leave policies, women were less likely to plan to have children during 
      residency (odds ratio 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.84]). In mediation 
      analysis, threats to career explained 67% of the gender variance. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Women residents intentionally postpone pregnancy because of perceived threats to 
      their careers. Medical educators should be aware of these findings when 
      counseling female trainees.
