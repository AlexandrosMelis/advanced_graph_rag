TI  - Comparative safety of infliximab and etanercept on the risk of serious 
      infections: does the association vary by patient characteristics?

AB  - PURPOSE: Infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal anti-TNFalpha antibody, has been found to 
      increase the risk of serious infections compared with the TNF receptor fusion 
      protein etanercept in some studies. It is unclear whether the risk varies by 
      patient characteristics. We conducted a study to address this question. METHODS: 
      We identified members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who initiated 
      infliximab (n = 793) or etanercept (n = 2692) in 1997-2007. Using a Cox model, we 
      estimated the propensity-score-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) of serious infections requiring hospitalization or opportunistic 
      infections comparing infliximab initiators to etanercept initiators. We tested 
      whether the adjusted HR differed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, 
      and smoking status. RESULTS: The crude incidence rate of serious infections per 
      100 person-years was 5.4 (95%CI: 3.8, 7.5) in patients <65 years and 16.0 (95%CI: 
      10.4, 23.4) in patients >/= 65 years during the first 3 months following treatment 
      initiation. Compared with etanercept, the adjusted HR during this period was 
      elevated for infliximab in patients <65 years (HR: 3.01; 95%CI: 1.49, 6.07), but 
      not in those >/= 65 years (HR 0.94; 95%CI: 0.41, 2.13). Findings did not suggest 
      that the HR varied by the other patient characteristics examined. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      increased risk of serious infections associated with infliximab relative to 
      etanercept did not appear to be modified by patients' sex, race/ethnicity, body 
      mass index, or smoking status. There was an indication that the increased risk 
      might be limited to patients <65 years. Additional studies are warranted to 
      verify or refute this finding.
