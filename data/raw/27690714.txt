AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the prehospital setting, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 
      professionals rely on providing positive pressure ventilation with a 
      bag-valve-mask (BVM). Multiple emergency medicine and critical care studies have 
      shown that lung-protective ventilation protocols reduce morbidity and mortality. 
      Our primary objective was to determine if a group of EMS professionals could 
      provide ventilations with a smaller BVM that would be sufficient to ventilate 
      patients. Secondary objectives included 1) if the pediatric bag provided volumes 
      similar to lung-protective ventilation in the hospital setting and 2) compare 
      volumes provided to the patient depending on the type of airway (mask, King tube, 
      and intubation). METHODS: Using a patient simulator of a head and thorax that was 
      able to record respiratory rate, tidal volume, peak pressure, and minute volume 
      via a laptop computer, participants were asked to ventilate the simulator during 
      six 1-minute ventilation tests. The first scenario was BVM ventilation with an 
      oropharyngeal airway in place ventilating with both an adult- and pediatric-sized 
      BVM, the second scenario had a supraglottic airway and both bags, and the third 
      scenario had an endotracheal tube and both bags. Participants were enrolled in 
      convenience manner while they were on-duty and the research staff was able to 
      travel to their stations. Prior to enrolling, participants were not given any 
      additional training on ventilation skills. RESULTS: We enrolled 50 providers from 
      a large, busy, urban fire-based EMS agency with 14.96 (SD = 9.92) mean years of 
      experience. Only 1.5% of all breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM during the 
      ventilation scenarios were below the recommended tidal volume. A greater 
      percentage of breaths delivered in the recommended range occurred when the 
      pediatric BVM was used (17.5% vs 5.1%, p < 0.001). Median volumes for each 
      scenario were 570.5mL, 664.0mL, 663.0mL for the pediatric BMV and 796.0mL, 
      994.5mL, 981.5mL for the adult BVM. In all three categories of airway devices, 
      the pediatric BVM provided lower median tidal volumes (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      The study suggests that ventilating an adult patient is possible with a smaller, 
      pediatric-sized BVM. The tidal volumes recorded with the pediatric BVM were more 
      consistent with lung-protective ventilation volumes.
