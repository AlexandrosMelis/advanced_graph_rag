AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with an enlarged prostate and suspicion of prostate cancer pose 
      a diagnostic dilemma. The prostate cancer detection rate of systematic 12-core 
      transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy is between 30% and 40%. For prostates 
      greater than 40 cc this decreases to 30% or less. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound 
      fusion biopsy has shown superior prostate cancer detection rates. We defined the 
      detection rate of magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy in men with an 
      enlarged prostate gland. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the 
      records of patients who underwent multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance 
      imaging followed by magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy at our 
      institution. Whole prostate volumes were calculated using magnetic resonance 
      imaging reconstructions. Detection rates were analyzed with respect to age, 
      prostate specific antigen and whole prostate volumes. Multivariable logistic 
      regression was used to assess these parameters as independent predictors of 
      prostate cancer detection. RESULTS: We analyzed 649 patients with a mean+/-SD age 
      of 61.8+/-7.9 years and a median prostate specific antigen of 6.65 ng/ml (IQR 
      4.35-11.0). Mean whole prostate volume was 58.7+/-34.3 cc. The overall detection 
      rate of the magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion platform was 55%. For prostates 
      less than 40 cc the detection rate was 71.1% compared to 57.5%, 46.9%, 46.9% 
      33.3%, 36.4% and 30.4% for glands 40 to 54.9, 55 to 69.9, 70 to 84.9, 85 to 99.9, 
      100 to 114.9 and 115 cc or greater, respectively (p<0.0001). Multivariable 
      logistic regression showed a significant inverse association of magnetic 
      resonance imaging volume with prostate cancer detection, controlling for age and 
      prostate specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Transrectal ultrasound guided and fusion 
      biopsy cancer detection rates decreased with increasing prostate volume. However, 
      magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy had a higher prostate cancer 
      detection rate compared to that of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy in the 
      literature. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy represents a promising 
      solution for patients with suspicion of prostate cancer and an enlarged prostate.
