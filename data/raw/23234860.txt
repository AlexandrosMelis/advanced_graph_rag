AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment delays in breast cancer are generally thought to affect 
      prognosis but the impact on survival remains unclear. Indicators for breast 
      cancer care include time to primary treatment. The purpose of this study was to 
      evaluate whether time to primary treatment (TPT) in breast cancer impacts 
      survival. METHOD: A total of 648 breast cancer patients treated in the University 
      Malaya Medical Center (UMMC), Malaysia between 2004 and 2005 were included in the 
      study. TPT was calculated from the date of pathological diagnosis to the date of 
      primary treatment. Mortality data was obtained from the National Registry of 
      Births and Deaths. Last date of follow-up was November 2010. RESULTS: Median TPT 
      was 18 days. Majority 508 (69.1%) of the patients received treatment within 30 
      days after diagnosis. The majority was surgically treated. Ethnicity (p=0.002) 
      and stage at presentation (p=0.007) were significantly associated with delayed 
      TPT. Malay ethnicity had delayed TPT compared to the Chinese; Hazard Ratio (HR) 
      1.9 (Confidence Interval (CI) 1.237, 2.987). Delayed TPT did not affect overall 
      survival on univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Time to primary 
      treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer had no impact on overall survival. 
      Further studies on care before diagnosis are important in drawing up meaningful 
      quality indicators.
