TI  - Does the manic/mixed episode distinction in bipolar disorder patients run true 
      over time?
PG  - 1324-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether the manic/mixed episode 
      distinction in patients with bipolar disorder runs true over time. METHOD: Over 
      an 11-year period, the observed distribution of manic and mixed episodes 
      (N=1,224) for patients with three or more entries in the management information 
      system of a community mental health center (N=241) was compared to the expected 
      distribution determined by averaging 1,000 randomly generated simulations. 
      RESULTS: Episodes were consistent (all manic or all mixed) in significantly more 
      patients than would be expected by chance. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a 
      pattern of diagnostic stability over time for manic and mixed episodes in 
      patients with bipolar disorder. Careful prospective studies of this issue are 
      needed.
