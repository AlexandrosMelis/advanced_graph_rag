TI  - Do mossy fibers release GABA?
PG  - 196-202
AB  - PURPOSE: Mossy fibers are the sole excitatory projection from dentate gyrus 
      granule cells to the hippocampus, forming part of the trisynaptic hippocampal 
      circuit. They undergo significant plasticity during epileptogenesis and have been 
      implicated in seizure generation. Mossy fibers are a highly unusual projection in 
      the mammalian brain; in addition to glutamate, they release adenosine, dynorphin, 
      zinc, and possibly other peptides. Mossy fiber terminals also show intense 
      immunoreactivity for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid 
      (GABA), and immunoreactivity for GAD67. The purpose of this review is to present 
      physiologic evidence of GABA release by mossy fibers and its modulation by 
      epileptic activity. METHODS: We used hippocampal slices from 3- to 5-week-old 
      guinea pigs and made whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from CA3 pyramidal 
      cells. We placed stimulating electrodes in stratum granulosum and adjusted their 
      position in order to recruit mossy fiber to CA3 projections. RESULTS: We have 
      shown that electrical stimuli that recruit dentate granule cells elicit 
      monosynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic signals in CA3 pyramidal neurons. 
      These inhibitory signals satisfy the criteria that distinguish mossy fiber-CA3 
      synapses: high sensitivity to metabotropic glutamate-receptor agonists, 
      facilitation during repetitive stimulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) 
      receptor-independent long-term potentiation. CONCLUSIONS: We have thus provided 
      compelling evidence that there is a mossy fiber GABAergic signal. The physiologic 
      role of this mossy fiber GABAergic signal is uncertain, but may be of 
      developmental importance. Other evidence suggests that this GABAergic signal is 
      transiently upregulated after seizures. This could have an inhibitory or 
      disinhibitory effect, and further work is needed to elucidate its actual role.
