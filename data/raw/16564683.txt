AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of ultrasonographic examination in boys with 
      an undescended testis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients who were referred to 
      the paediatric surgeon after detection of an undescended testis were evaluated 
      prospectively between November 2001 and November 2004. Among these 377 patients, 
      87 were referred with an ultrasonogram previously prescribed by the referring 
      primary physician. The results of the ultrasonogram were compared to the results 
      of the clinical examination of the paediatric surgeon and, in cases of no 
      palpable testis, to the surgical findings. RESULTS: Ultrasonography did not 
      detect the retractile testes. Ultrasonography detected 67% of the palpable 
      undescended testes. In cases of no palpable testis, the ultrasonographic 
      examination missed the abdominal testes and sometimes other structures were 
      falsely interpreted as a testis. CONCLUSION: Sonography has no place in the 
      diagnosis of undescended testis.
