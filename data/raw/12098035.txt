TI  - Does a special interest in laparoscopy affect the treatment of acute 
      cholecystitis?
PG  - 1697-703
AB  - BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that the treatment of patients with acute 
      cholecystitis (AC) would be improved under the care of laparoscopic specialists. 
      METHODS: The records of patients undergoing cholecystectomy for AC from 1 January 
      1996 to 31 December 1998 were reviewed retrospectively. Of 170 patients, 48 were 
      cared for by three laparoscopic specialists (LS group), whereas 122 were treated 
      by nine general surgeons who perform only laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) (GS 
      group). The rates of successful LC, complications, and length of hospital stay 
      were compared. Multivariate analysis was used to control for baseline 
      differences. RESULTS: The patients in the GS group were older (median age, 63 vs 
      53 years; p = 0.01). In all, 31 LS patients (65%), as compared with 44 GS 
      patients (36%), had successful laparoscopic treatment (p = 0.001). The operating 
      time was the same (median, 70 min). The proportion of patients with postoperative 
      complications was similar in the two groups (37% in the GS vs 31% in the LS 
      group; p = 0.6). The median postoperative hospital stay (3 vs 5 days; p <0.01) 
      was shorter in the LS group. On logistic regression analysis, significant 
      predictors of a successful laparoscopic operation included LS group (p <0.01) and 
      age (p = 0). Predictors of prolonged length of hospital stay were age (p <0.01) 
      and comorbidity score (p <0.01), with LS group status not a significant factor (p 
      = 0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AC are more likely to undergo successful LC 
      if cared for by a surgeon with an interest in laparoscopy. However, length of 
      hospital stay is influenced more by patient factors in a multivariate model.
