TI  - Do cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice predict the presence of pancreatic 
      diseases?
PG  - 782-9
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cytokine concentration in pancreatic juice of patients with 
      pancreatic disease is unknown. Secretin stimulation allows endoscopic collection 
      of pancreatic juice secreted into the duodenum. We aimed to evaluate the cytokine 
      concentrations in pancreatic juice of patients with abdominal pain to 
      discriminate presence from absence of pancreatic disease. METHODS: From January 
      2003-December 2004, consecutive patients with abdominal pain compatible with 
      pancreatic origin were enrolled. Patients underwent upper endoscopy. Intravenous 
      secretin (0.2 mug/kg) was given immediately before scope intubation. Pancreatic 
      juice collected from the duodenum was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen 
      until assays were performed. Pancreatic juice levels of interleukin-8, 
      interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and transforming growth 
      factor-beta 1 were measured by modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The 
      final diagnosis was made by the primary gastroenterologist on the basis of 
      medical history; laboratory, endoscopic, and imaging studies; and clinical 
      follow-up. Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for 
      statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of 130 patients screened, 118 met the inclusion 
      criteria. Multivariate analysis revealed that only interleukin-8 was able to 
      discriminate between normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis (P = .011), 
      pancreatic cancer (P = .044), and the presence of pancreatic diseases (P = .007). 
      Individual cytokine concentrations were not significantly different in chronic 
      pancreatitis compared with pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokine levels can be 
      measured in pancreatic juice obtained from the duodenum without direct 
      cannulation of the pancreatic duct. Interleukin-8 concentration in pancreatic 
      juice can be used to discriminate between normal pancreas and patients with 
      pancreatic disease. This is a relatively simple and noninvasive method to aid in 
      the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases.
