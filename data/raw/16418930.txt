TI  - [Landolt C and snellen e acuity: differences in strabismus amblyopia?].
PG  - 24-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of visual acuity depends on the optotypes used for 
      measurement. The ability to recognize different optotypes differs even if their 
      critical details appear under the same visual angle. Since optotypes are 
      evaluated on individuals with good visual acuity and without eye disorders, 
      differences in the lower visual acuity range cannot be excluded. In this study, 
      visual acuity measured with the Snellen E was compared to the Landolt C acuity. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: 100 patients (age 8 - 90 years, median 60.5 years) with 
      various eye disorders, among them 39 with amblyopia due to strabismus, and 13 
      healthy volunteers were tested. Charts with the Snellen E and the Landolt C 
      (Precision Vision) which mimic the ETDRS charts were used to assess visual 
      acuity. Three out of 5 optotypes per line had to be correctly identified, while 
      wrong answers were monitored. In the group of patients, the eyes with the lower 
      visual acuity, and the right eyes of the healthy subjects, were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Differences between Landolt C acuity (LR) and Snellen E acuity (SE) were 
      small. The mean decimal values for LR and SE were 0.25 and 0.29 in the entire 
      group and 0.14 and 0.16 for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia. The mean 
      difference between LR and SE was 0.55 lines in the entire group and 0.55 lines 
      for the eyes with strabismus amblyopia, with higher values of SE in both groups. 
      The results of the other groups were similar with only small differences between 
      LR and SE. CONCLUSION: Using the charts described, there was only a slight 
      overestimation of visual acuity by the Snellen E compared to the Landolt C, even 
      in strabismus amblyopia. Small differences in the lower visual acuity range have 
      to be considered.
