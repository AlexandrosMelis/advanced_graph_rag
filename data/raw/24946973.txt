AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients 
      after oncoplastic surgery for early breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 
      retrospective analysis of 136 breasts of 134 patients, who received 
      breast-conserving oncoplastic surgery for low-risk breast cancer between 2002 and 
      2010 in the Universities of Vienna and Luebeck followed by adjuvant APBI applying 
      total doses of pulse dose rate of 50.4 Gy or high-dose rate (HDR) of 32 Gy over 
      4 days. Target volume definition was performed by the use of surgical-free margin 
      data, related to intraoperatively fixed clip positions, pre- and postoperative 
      imaging, and palpation. RESULTS: At the time of data acquisition, 131 of 134 
      patients were alive. The median follow-up time was 39 months (range, 4-106 
      months). After high-dose rate treatment, 3 of 89 patients showed systemic 
      progress after a mean follow-up of 47 months (range, 19-75 months) and 2 patients 
      had a different quadrant in-breast tumor after 27 and 35 months. One patient died 
      7 months after treatment of unknown causes. After pulse dose rate treatment, 1 of 
      45 patients had a local recurrence after 42 months and 1 patient died because of 
      another cause after 13 months. We observed mild fibrosis in 27 breasts, 
      telangiectasia in 6, hyperpigmentation in 14 cases, and keloid formation in 1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest the feasibility of multicatheter 
      APBI after oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery in selected low-risk breast 
      cancer patients; however, special attention to target volume definition is 
      needed. Further prospective investigations with long follow-up are needed to 
      define the real value of the procedure.
