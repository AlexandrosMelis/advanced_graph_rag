TI  - Does the sequence of clamp application during open abdominal aortic aneurysm 
      surgery influence distal embolisation?
PG  - 61-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Embolisation of atherosclerotic debris during abdominal aortic 
      aneurysm (AAA) repair is responsible for significant peri-operative morbidity. 
      Reports have suggested that preferential clamping of the distal vessel(s) before 
      the proximal aorta may decrease the number of emboli passing distally and hence 
      reduce complications. METHODS: Forty patients undergoing AAA repair were 
      randomised to have either first clamping of the proximal aorta or the iliac 
      vessels. Emboli passing through the Superficial Femoral Arteries were detected 
      with a Transcranial Doppler ultrasound system. RESULTS: There was no difference 
      between the two groups in the number of emboli detected (p=0.49) and no 
      significant correlation between number of emboli and dissection time (r=0.0008). 
      However, there was a significantly higher number of emboli in the patient 
      sub-group that were current smokers (p=0.034). CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be 
      no difference in the numbers of emboli detected when the first vascular clamp is 
      applied to the proximal aorta or iliacs.
