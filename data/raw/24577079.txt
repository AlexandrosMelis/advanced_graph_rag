TI  - Does strategy training reduce age-related deficits in working memory?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older adults typically perform worse on measures of working memory 
      (WM) than do young adults; however, age-related differences in WM performance 
      might be reduced if older adults use effective encoding strategies. OBJECTIVE: 
      The purpose of the current experiment was to evaluate WM performance after 
      training individuals to use effective encoding strategies. METHODS: Participants 
      in the training group (older adults: n = 39; young adults: n = 41) were taught 
      about various verbal encoding strategies and their differential effectiveness and 
      were trained to use interactive imagery and sentence generation on a 
      list-learning task. Participants in the control group (older: n = 37; young: n = 
      38) completed an equally engaging filler task. All participants completed a pre- 
      and post-training reading span task, which included self-reported strategy use, 
      as well as two transfer tasks that differed in the affordance to use the trained 
      strategies - a paired-associate recall task and the self-ordered pointing task. 
      RESULTS: Both young and older adults were able to use the target strategies on 
      the WM task and showed gains in WM performance after training. The age-related WM 
      deficit was not greatly affected, however, and the training gains did not 
      transfer to the other cognitive tasks. In fact, participants attempted to adapt 
      the trained strategies for a paired-associate recall task, but the increased 
      strategy use did not benefit their performance. CONCLUSIONS: Strategy training 
      can boost WM performance, and its benefits appear to arise from strategy-specific 
      effects and not from domain-general gains in cognitive ability.
