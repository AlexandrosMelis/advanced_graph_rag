AB  - AIMS: Hypoglycaemia caused by glucose-lowering therapy has been linked to 
      cardiovascular (CV) events. The ORIGIN trial provides an opportunity to further 
      assess this relationship. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 12 537 participants 
      with dysglycaemia and high CV-risk were randomized to basal insulin glargine 
      titrated to a fasting glucose of </= 5.3 mmol/L (95 mg/dL) or standard glycaemic 
      care. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was defined as symptoms confirmed by glucose </= 54 
      mg/dL and severe hypoglycaemia as a requirement for assistance or glucose </= 36 
      mg/dL. Outcomes were: (i) the composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial 
      infarction or stroke; (ii) mortality; (iii) CV mortality; and (iv) arrhythmic 
      death. Hazards were estimated before and after adjustment for a hypoglycaemia 
      propensity score. During a median of 6.2 years (IQR: 5.8-6.7), non-severe 
      hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in 41.7 and 14.4% glargine and standard group 
      participants, respectively, while severe episodes occurred in 5.7 and 1.8%, 
      respectively. Non-severe hypoglycaemia was not associated with any outcome 
      following adjustment. Conversely, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a 
      greater risk for the primary outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P < 0.001), 
      mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P < 0.001), CV death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 
      1.27-2.30, P < 0.001) and arrhythmic death (HR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.17-2.67, P = 
      0.007). Similar findings were noted for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia for the 
      primary outcome and mortality. The severe hypoglycaemia hazard for all four 
      outcomes was higher with standard care than with insulin glargine. CONCLUSION: 
      Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with an increased risk for CV outcomes in 
      people at high CV risk and dysglycaemia. Although allocation to insulin glargine 
      vs. standard care was associated with an increased risk of severe and non-severe 
      hypoglycaemia, the relative risk of CV outcomes with hypoglycaemia was lower with 
      insulin glargine-based glucose-lowering therapy than with the standard glycaemic 
      control. Trial Registration (ORIGIN ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00069784).
