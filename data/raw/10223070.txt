TI  - Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic 
      pregnancy? An appraisal of the evidence.
PG  - 101-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To critically assess the evidence that appendiceal perforation is a 
      risk factor for subsequent tubal infertility or ectopic pregnancy. DATA SOURCES: 
      Epidemiologic studies investigating the relationship between appendectomy and 
      infertility or ectopic pregnancy were identified by searching the MEDLINE 
      database from 1966 to 1997. Appropriate citations were also extracted from a 
      manual search of the bibliographies of selected papers. STUDY SELECTION: 
      Twenty-three articles were retrieved. Only 4 presented original data including 
      comparisons to a nonexposed control group and they form the basis for this study. 
      DATA EXTRACTION: Because the raw data or specific techniques of data analysis 
      were not always explicitly described, indices of risk for exposure were extracted 
      from the data as presented and were analysed without attempting to convert them 
      to a common measure. DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles were assessed according to the 
      criteria of the Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group for evaluating articles on 
      harm. Review of the literature yielded estimates of the risk of adverse fertility 
      outcomes ranging from 1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1 to 2.5) for ectopic 
      pregnancy after an appendectomy to 4.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 14.9) for tubal infertility 
      from perforation of the appendix. Recall bias, and poor adjustment for 
      confounding variables in some reports, weakened the validity of the studies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance 
      of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of 
      perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the 
      data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased 
      ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a 
      definitive answer.
