TI  - Is there any evidence of a "July effect" in patients undergoing major cancer 
      surgery?
PG  - 82-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The "July effect" refers to the phenomenon of adverse impacts on 
      patient care arising from the changeover in medical staff that takes place during 
      this month at academic medical centres in North America. There has been some 
      evidence supporting the presence of the July effect, including data from surgical 
      specialties. Uniformity of care, regardless of time of year, is required for 
      patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We therefore sought to perform a 
      population-level assessment for the presence of a July effect in this field. 
      METHODS: We used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample to abstract data on patients 
      undergoing 1 of 8 major cancer surgeries at academic medical centres between Jan. 
      1, 1999, and Dec. 30, 2009. The primary outcomes examined were postoperative 
      complications and in-hospital mortality. Univariate analyses and subsequently 
      multivariate analyses, controlling for patient and hospital characteristics, were 
      performed to identify whether the time of surgery was an independent predictor of 
      outcome after major cancer surgery. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, the overall 
      postoperative complication rate, as well as genitourinary and hematologic 
      complications specifically, was higher in July than the rest of the year. 
      However, on multivariate analysis, only hematologic complications were 
      significantly higher in July, with no difference in overall postoperative 
      complication rate or in-hospital mortality for all 8 surgeries considered 
      separately or together. CONCLUSION: On the whole, the data confirm an absence of 
      a July effect in patients undergoing major cancer surgery.
