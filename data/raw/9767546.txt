TI  - Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic 
      plasma: is there oxidative stress in uremia?
PG  - 1290-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed by non-enzymatic 
      glycation and oxidation (glycoxidation) reactions, have been implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of several diseases, including normoglycemic uremia. AGE research in 
      uremia has focused on the accumulation of carbohydrate-derived adducts generated 
      by the Maillard reaction. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that one 
      AGE, the glycoxidation product carboxymethyllysine (CML), could be derived not 
      only from carbohydrates but also from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in 
      vitro, raising the possibility that both carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation 
      might be increased in uremia. METHODS: To address this hypothesis, we applied gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography to 
      measure protein adducts formed in uremic plasma by reactions between carbonyl 
      compounds and protein amino groups: pentosidine derived from carbohydrate-derived 
      carbonyls, malondialdehyde (MDA)-lysine derived from lipid-derived carbonyls, and 
      CML originating possibly from both sources. RESULTS: All three adducts were 
      elevated in uremic plasma. Plasma CML levels were mainly (>95%) albumin bound. 
      Their levels were not correlated with fructoselysine levels and were similar in 
      diabetic and non-diabetic patients on hemodialysis, indicating that their 
      increase was not driven by glucose. Pentosidine and MDA-lysine were also 
      increased in plasma to the same extent in diabetic and non-diabetic hemodialysis 
      patients. Statistical analysis indicated that plasma levels of CML correlated 
      weakly (P < 0.05) with those of pentosidine and MDA-lysine, but that pentosidine 
      and MDA-lysine varied independently (P > 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest 
      that the increased levels of AGEs in blood, and probably in tissues, reported in 
      uremia implicate a broad derangement in non-enzymatic biochemistry involving 
      alterations in autoxidation of both carbohydrates and lipids.
