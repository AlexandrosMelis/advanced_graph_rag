TI  - Pertrochanteric fractures: is there an advantage to an intramedullary nail?: a 
      randomized, prospective study of 206 patients comparing the dynamic hip screw and 
      proximal femoral nail.
PG  - 386-93
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the results between a sliding compression hip screw and an 
      intramedullary nail in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. DESIGN: 
      Prospective computer-generated randomization of 206 patients into two study 
      groups: those treated by sliding compression hip screw (Group 1; n = 106) and 
      those treated by intramedullary nailing (Group 2; n = 100). SETTING: University 
      Level I trauma center. PATIENTS: All patients over the age of fifty-five years 
      presenting with fractures of the trochanteric region caused by a low-energy 
      injury, classified as AO/OTA Type 31-A1 and A2. INTERVENTION: Treatment with a 
      sliding compression hip screw (Dynamic Hip Screw; Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, 
      Switzerland) or an intramedullary nail (Proximal Femoral Nail; Synthes-Stratec, 
      Oberdorf, Switzerland). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Intraoperative: operative and 
      fluoroscopy times, the difficulty of the operation, intraoperative complications, 
      and blood loss. Radiologic: fracture healing and failure of fixation. Clinical: 
      pain, social functioning score, and mobility score. RESULTS: The minimum 
      follow-up was one year. We did not find any statistically significant difference, 
      intraoperatively, radiologically, or clinically, between the two groups of 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: There is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a 
      sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures AO/OTA 
      31-A1 and A2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show 
      decreased complications or improved patient outcome.
