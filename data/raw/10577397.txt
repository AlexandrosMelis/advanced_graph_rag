TI  - Is a pressor necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac 
      arrest?
PG  - 697-702
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Occlusion of the descending aorta and infusion of oxygenated 
      ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin may improve the efficacy of advanced 
      cardiac life support (ACLS). Because selective aortic perfusion and oxygenation 
      (SAPO) directly increases coronary perfusion pressure, exogenous epinephrine may 
      not be required. The purpose of this study was to determine whether exogenous 
      epinephrine is necessary during SAPO by comparing the rate of return of 
      spontaneous circulation and aortic and coronary perfusion pressures during 
      ACLS-SAPO in animals treated with either intra-aortic epinephrine or saline 
      solution. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, interventional before-after trial 
      with a canine model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest and ACLS based on 
      external chest compression was performed. The ECG, right atrial, aortic arch, and 
      esophageal pulse pressures were measured continuously. A descending aortic 
      occlusion balloon catheter was placed through the femoral artery. Ventricular 
      fibrillation was induced, and no therapy was given during the 10-minute arrest 
      time. Basic life support was then initiated and normalized by standardization of 
      esophageal pulse pressure and central aortic blood gases. After 3 minutes of 
      basic life support, the aortic occlusion balloon was inflated, and 0.01 mg/kg 
      epinephrine or saline solution was administered through the aortic catheter 
      followed by 450 mL of ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin over 2 minutes. 
      Defibrillation was then attempted. The outcomes and changes in intravascular 
      pressures were compared. RESULTS: Aortic pressures were higher during infusions 
      in animals treated with epinephrine. During infusion, the mean aortic relaxation 
      pressure increased by 58+/-5 mm Hg in animals that had received epinephrine 
      versus 20+/-11 mm Hg in those that had received saline placebo. The coronary 
      perfusion pressure during infusion increased by 52+/-8 mm Hg in animals that had 
      received epinephrine versus 26+/-10 mm Hg in those that had received saline. Only 
      2 of 7 animals in the placebo group had return of spontaneous circulation versus 
      7 of 8 in the epinephrine group. CONCLUSION: The addition of epinephrine to 
      ACLS-SAPO increases vital organ perfusion pressures and improves outcome from 
      cardiac arrest. There appears to be a profound loss of arterial vasomotor tone 
      after prolonged arrest. This loss of vasomotor tone may make exogenous pressors 
      necessary for resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest.
