AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the comprehensive HIV/STD Control Program 
      established in Jamaica since the late 1980s on the HIV/AIDS epidemic. METHODS: 
      AIDS case reports, HIV testing of blood donors, antenatal clinic attenders (ANC), 
      food service workers, sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic attenders, female 
      prostitutes, homosexuals and other groups were used to monitor the HIV/AIDS 
      epidemic. Primary and secondary syphilis and cases of congenital syphilis were 
      also monitored. National knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) surveys were 
      conducted in 1988, 1989, 1992, 1994 and 1996. RESULTS: The annual AIDS incidence 
      rate in Jamaica increased only marginally in the past three years from 18.5 per 
      100000 population to 21.4 in 1997. HIV prevalence in the general population 
      groups tested has been about 1% or less. Among those at high risk, HIV prevalence 
      rates have risen to 6.3% (95% confidence interval 5.0-8.0) in STD clinic 
      attenders, around 10% and 21% in female prostitutes in Kingston and Montego Bay 
      respectively and approximately 30% among homosexuals. Syphilis rates and 
      congenital syphilis cases have declined. The proportion of men aged 15-49 years 
      reporting sex with a non-regular partner declined from 35% in 1994 to 26% in 1996 
      (P< 0.001). Women ever having used condoms increased from 51% in 1988 to 62.5% in 
      1992 and 73% in 1994 and 1996 (P< 0.001), while condom use with a non-regular 
      partner increased from 37% in 1992 to 73% in 1996 (P= 0.006). Condom use among 
      men was high over the period: around 81% had ever used condoms and 77% used them 
      with non-regular partners. Gay men, inner-city adults and adolescents aged 12-14 
      years all reported increases in condom use while condom sales and distribution 
      increased from around 2 million in 1985 to 10 million in 1995. CONCLUSION: 
      HIV/STD control measures appear to have slowed the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Jamaica, 
      however a significant minority of persons continue to have unprotected sex in 
      high risk situations.
