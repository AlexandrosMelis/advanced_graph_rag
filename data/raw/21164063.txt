AB  - PURPOSE: A possible role for fondaparinux as a bridging agent in the 
      perioperative setting is explored. SUMMARY: Anticoagulation guidelines provide 
      minimal direction on the perioperative use of fondaparinux. Fondaparinux's 
      extended half-life of 17-21 hours complicates its use as a perioperative bridging 
      therapy. The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, 
      particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial 
      anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be 
      derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and 
      anesthesia guidelines. Published trials used fondaparinux sodium 2.5 mg daily for 
      venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in surgical patients, and the majority avoided 
      its use before surgery in patients receiving neuraxial anesthesia. Three case 
      reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one 
      used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. 
      Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations 
      regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use. For 
      these reasons, it may be optimal to avoid fondaparinux use before surgery. In 
      some instances, the use of low-molecular-weight heparin or inpatient use of i.v. 
      unfractionated heparin is not possible, is contraindicated, or has limited 
      efficacy, such as a patient with history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or 
      antithrombin III deficiency. Fondaparinux may have a role in bridge therapy for 
      these patients. CONCLUSION: The role of fondaparinux in perioperative bridge 
      therapy has not been established, and there are some important limitations to its 
      use as a routine bridging agent.
