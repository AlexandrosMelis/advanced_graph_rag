      people?
PG  - 28-30
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess Internet use amongst young people to determine whether it 
      would be a practical way to provide sex education and information. METHODS: Year 
      10 students (aged 14-15 years) from North Nottinghamshire schools were asked to 
      participate in focus groups to discuss the Internet. A series of predefined 
      questions were directed to the whole group to generate debate. Areas explored 
      included: Internet access and site; frequency and purpose of Internet use; 
      websites visited; ideas for a genitourinary medicine (GUM) website. Responses 
      were recorded by a hand count or as individual verbal responses. RESULTS: 
      Thirteen focus groups were held involving 287 students of approximately equal sex 
      distribution. All had access to Internet facilities at school and 224 (78.0%) had 
      access elsewhere. Access was at least once a week by 178 (62.0%) mostly for 
      e-mail, games, chatlines and homework. No one accessed for health information. 
      One hundred and seventy-nine (62.4%) participants said they would use a GUM 
      website. A 'question line' where they could e-mail questions to a health care 
      professional was of interest to 202 (70.4%) participants. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      Internet would be a practical and accessible way of delivering sexual health 
      education to young people, particularly if it is incorporated into activities and 
      websites they enjoy.
