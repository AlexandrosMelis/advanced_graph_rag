AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis with increased left 
      ventricular wall thickness could easily be misdiagnosed by echocardiography as 
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Our aim was to create a diagnostic tool based 
      on echocardiography and ECG that could optimise identification of ATTR 
      amyloidosis. METHODS: Data were analysed from 33 patients with biopsy proven ATTR 
      amyloidosis and 30 patients with diagnosed HCM. Conventional features from ECG 
      were acquired as well as two dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, speckle 
      tracking derived strain and tissue characterisation analysis. Classification 
      trees were used to select the most important variables for differentiation 
      between ATTR amyloidosis and HCM. RESULTS: The best classification was obtained 
      using both ECG and echocardiographic features, where a QRS voltage >30 mm was 
      diagnostic for HCM, whereas in patients with QRS voltage <30 mm, an 
      interventricular septal/posterior wall thickness ratio (IVSt/PWt) >1.6 was 
      consistent with HCM and a ratio <1.6 supported the diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis. 
      This classification presented both high sensitivity (0.939) and specificity 
      (0.833). CONCLUSION: Our study proposes an easily interpretable classification 
      method for the differentiation between HCM and increased left ventricular 
      myocardial thickness due to ATTR amyloidosis. Our combined echocardiographic and 
      ECG model could increase the ability to identify ATTR cardiac amyloidosis in 
      clinical practice.
