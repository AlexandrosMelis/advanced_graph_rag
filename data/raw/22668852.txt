      from a controlled feeding trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of obesity in African American (AA) women may 
      result, in part, from a lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) than non-AA women. If 
      true, AA women should require fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain 
      weight. Our objective was to determine in the setting of a controlled feeding 
      study, if AA women required fewer calories than non-AA women to maintain weight. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This analysis includes 206 women (73% AA), aged 22-75 
      years, who participated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) 
      trial-a multicenter, randomized, controlled, feeding study comparing the effects 
      of 3 dietary patterns on blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or 
      stage 1 hypertension. After a 3-week run-in, participants were randomized to 1 of 
      3 dietary patterns for 8 weeks. Calorie intake was adjusted during feeding to 
      maintain stable weight. The primary outcome of this analysis was average daily 
      calorie (kcal) intake during feeding. RESULTS: AA women had higher baseline 
      weight and body mass index than non-AA women (78.4 vs 72.4 kg, P < .01; 29.0 vs 
      27.6 kg/m(2), P < .05, respectively). During intervention feeding, mean (SD) kcal 
      was 2168 (293) in AA women and 2073 (284) in non-AA women. Mean intake was 94.7 
      kcal higher in AA women than in non-AA women (P < .05). After adjustment for 
      potential confounders, there was no difference in caloric intake between AA and 
      non-AA women (Delta = -2.8 kcal, P = .95). CONCLUSION: These results do not support 
      the view that AA women are at greater risk for obesity because they require fewer 
      calories to maintain weight.
