AB  - OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled study addressed whether sonographic needle 
      guidance affected clinical outcomes of intraarticular (IA) joint injections. 
      METHODS: In total, 148 painful joints were randomized to IA triamcinolone 
      acetonide injection by conventional palpation-guided anatomic injection or 
      sonographic image-guided injection enhanced with a one-handed control syringe 
      (the reciprocating device). A one-needle, 2-syringe technique was used, where the 
      first syringe was used to introduce the needle, aspirate any effusion, and 
      anesthetize and dilate the IA space with lidocaine. After IA placement and 
      synovial space dilation were confirmed, a syringe exchange was performed, and 
      corticosteroid was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling IA 
      needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks), and changes in 
      pain scores were measured with a 0-10 cm visual analog pain scale (VAS). RESULTS: 
      Relative to conventional palpation-guided methods, sonographic guidance resulted 
      in 43.0% reduction in procedural pain (p < 0.001), 58.5% reduction in absolute 
      pain scores at the 2 week outcome (p < 0.001), 75% reduction in significant pain 
      (VAS pain score > or = 5 cm; p < 0.001), 25.6% increase in the responder rate 
      (reduction in VAS score > or = 50% from baseline; p < 0.01), and 62.0% reduction 
      in the nonresponder rate (reduction in VAS score < 50% from baseline; p < 0.01). 
      Sonography also increased detection of effusion by 200% and volume of aspirated 
      fluid by 337%. CONCLUSION: Sonographic needle guidance significantly improves the 
      performance and outcomes of outpatient IA injections in a clinically significant 
      manner.
