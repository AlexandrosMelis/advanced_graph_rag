AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to show the relationship between serum paraoxonase 1 
      level and the epicardial fat tissue thickness. METHODS: Two hundred and seven 
      patients without any atherosclerotic disease history were included in this 
      cross-sectional observational study. Correlation analysis was performed to 
      determine the correlation between epicardial fat tissue thickness, which was 
      measured by echocardiography and serum paraoxonase 1 level. Also correlation 
      analysis was performed to show correlation between patients' clinical and 
      laboratory findings and the level of serum paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) and the 
      epicardial fat tissue thickness. Pearson and Spearman test were used for 
      correlation analysis. RESULTS: No linear correlation between epicardial fat 
      tissue thickness and serum PON 1 found (correlation coefficient: -0.127, 
      p=0.069). When epicardial fat tissue thickness were grouped as 7 mm and over, and 
      below, and 5 mm and over, and below, serum PON 1 level were significantly lower 
      in >/=7 mm group (PON1 : 168.9 U/L) than <7 mm group (PON 1: 253.9 U/L) (p<0.001). 
      Also hypertension prevalence was increased in >/=7 mm group (p=0.001). Serum 
      triglyceride was found to be higher in >/=7 mm group (p=0.014), body mass index was 
      found higher in >/=5 mm group (p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Serum PON 1 level is not 
      correlated with the epicardial fat tissue thickness. But PON 1 level is lower in 
      patients with epicardial fat tissue thickness 7 mm and over. Therefore, increased 
      atherosclerosis progression can be found among patients with 7 mm and higher 
      epicardial fat tissue thickness.
