AB  - BACKGROUND: Parental drinking has been shown to be associated with offspring 
      drinking. However, the relationship appears to be more complex than often assumed 
      and few studies have tracked it over longer time periods. AIMS: To explore the 
      long-term (10-year) transmission of familial drinking during adolescence to 
      offspring drinking patterns in young adulthood. DESIGN: Swedish longitudinal 
      study, assessing the relationship between familial drinking in 2000 and offspring 
      drinking in 2010 using simultaneous quantile regression analysis (n=744). DATA: 
      Data on familial drinking was gathered from the Swedish level-of-living surveys 
      (LNU) and from partner LNU in 2000 while data on offspring drinking in young 
      adulthood was gathered from LNU 2010. Drinking among offspring, parents and 
      potential stepparents was measured through identical quantity-frequency indices 
      referring to the past 12 months in 2010 and 2000 respectively. RESULTS: Young 
      adults whose families were abstainers in 2000 drank substantially less across 
      quintiles in 2010 than offspring of non-abstaining families. The difference, 
      however, was not statistically significant between quintiles of the conditional 
      distribution. Actual drinking levels in drinking families were not at all or 
      weakly associated with drinking in offspring. Supplementary analyses confirmed 
      these patterns. CONCLUSION: The association between familial drinking and 
      offspring drinking in young adulthood exhibits clear non-linear trends. Changes 
      in the lower part of the familial drinking distribution are strongly related to 
      drinking in young adults, but the actual levels of drinking in drinking families 
      appear less important in shaping the drinking patterns of the offspring in young 
      adulthood.
