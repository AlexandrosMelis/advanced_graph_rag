TI  - Substance use and HIV-related sexual behaviors among US high school students: are 
      they related?
PG  - 1116-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to examine whether use of alcohol, 
      cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and other illicit drugs is related to the 
      likelihood of sexual behaviors that increase risk for human immunodeficiency 
      virus (HIV) infection among youth. METHODS: The 1990 national Youth Risk Behavior 
      Survey was used to collect self-reported information about a broad range of 
      health risk behaviors from a representative sample of 11,631 high school students 
      in the United States. RESULTS: Students who reported no substance use were least 
      likely to report having had sexual intercourse, having had four or more sex 
      partners, and not having used a condom at last sexual intercourse. Adjusted for 
      age, sex, and race/ethnicity, odds ratios for each of these sexual risk behaviors 
      were greatest among students who had used marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit 
      drugs. Students who had used only alcohol or cigarettes had smaller but still 
      significant increases in the likelihood of having had sexual intercourse and of 
      having had four or more sex partners. CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevention programs for 
      youth should recognize that substance use may be an important indicator of risk 
      for HIV infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome through its association 
      with unsafe sexual behaviors.
