      of the aneurysm important?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rate of aortic aneurysm rupture correlates with the aneurysm's 
      diameter, and a higher rate of rupture is observed in patients with larger 
      aneurysms. According to the literature, contradictory results concerning the 
      relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm size have been reported. 
      AIM: In this paper, we assessed the influence of changes in atmospheric pressure 
      on abdominal aneurysm ruptures in relationship to the aneurysm's size. METHODS: 
      The records of 223 patients with ruptured abdominal aneurysms were evaluated. All 
      of the patients had been admitted to the department in the period 1997-2007 from 
      the Silesia region. The atmospheric pressures on the day of the rupture and on 
      the days both before the rupture and between the rupture events were compared. 
      The size of the aneurysm was also considered in the analysis. RESULTS: There were 
      no statistically significant differences in pressure between the days of rupture 
      and the remainder of the days within an analysed period. The highest frequency of 
      the admission of patients with a ruptured aortic aneurysm was observed during 
      periods of winter and spring, when the highest mean values of atmospheric 
      pressure were observed; however, this observation was not statistically 
      confirmed. A statistically non-significant trend towards the higher rupture of 
      large aneurysms (> 7 cm) was observed in the cases where the pressure increased 
      between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture. This trend was 
      particularly pronounced in patients suffering from hypertension (p = 0.1). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that there 
      is a direct link between atmospheric pressure values and abdominal aortic 
      aneurysm ruptures.
