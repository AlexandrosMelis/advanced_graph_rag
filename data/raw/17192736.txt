TI  - Is fluoroscopy essential for retrieval of lower ureteric stones?
PG  - 70-2
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ureteroscopy 
      for lower ureteric stones without the use of fluoroscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Between June 2001 and January 2005, a total of 110 patients with a mean age of 
      33.5 years (range 12-65) suffering from of lower ureteral calculi (below the 
      upper margin of the sacroiliac joint) prospectively underwent ureteroscopic 
      removal. Retrograde pyelography was avoided, and no safety guidewire was placed. 
      Whenever required, the ureteric meatus was dilated with a ureteric balloon under 
      direct vision. Double-J stent placement was done with the aid of ureteroscopy. A 
      fluoroscope was kept standby. The patients had a postoperative X-ray of the 
      kidney-ureter-bladder region to document the stone clearance. RESULTS: The mean 
      stone size was 8.7 mm (range 6-15). Complete clearance without the use of 
      fluoroscopy was achieved in 99 patients (94.2%). Fluoroscopy was required in 6 
      patients (4%) for calcified stricture (n = 1), duplex system (n = 1), narrow and 
      tortuous meatus causing difficulty in passing the 5-Fr balloon dilator (n = 3), 
      and confirmation of spontaneous passage of the stone (n = 1). Of the 13 patients 
      who required balloon dilatation it was successfully achieved without fluoroscopy. 
      Double-J stenting was done due to mucosal ulceration (n = 3), polypoid reaction 
      (n = 2), and perforation (n = 1). All these patients had correct placement of the 
      stent, as confirmed by X-ray of the kidney-ureter-bladder region postoperatively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To uphold the notion for radiation exposure to be as low as 
      reasonably achievable, ureteroscopic stone retrieval can safely be done without 
      the use of fluoroscopy in a significant number of patients.
