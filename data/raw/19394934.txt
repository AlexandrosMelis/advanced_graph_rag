AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of large-scale urban attacks on civilian populations 
      has significantly increased across the globe over the past decade. These 
      incidents often result in Hospital Multiple Casualty Incidents (HMCI), which are 
      very challenging to hospital teams. 15 years ago the Emergency and Disaster 
      Medicine Division in the Israeli Ministry of Health defined a key of 20 percent 
      of each hospital's bed capacity as its readiness for multiple casualties. Half of 
      those casualties are expected to require immediate medical treatment. This study 
      was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the current readiness guidelines based 
      on the epidemiology of encountered HMCIs. METHODS: A retrospective study of HMCIs 
      was recorded in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) home front command and the 
      Israeli National Trauma Registry (ITR) between November 2000 and June 2003. An 
      HMCI is defined by the Emergency and Disaster Medicine Division in the Israeli 
      Ministry of Health as >or=10 casualties or >or=4 suffering from injuries with an 
      ISS>or=16 arriving to a single hospital. RESULTS: The study includes a total of 
      32 attacks, resulting in 62 HMCIs and 1292 casualties. The mean number of 
      arriving casualties to a single hospital was 20.8+/-13.3 (range 4-56, median 
      16.5). In 95% of the HMCIs the casualty load was <or=52. Based on severity scores 
      and ED discharges 1022 (79.2%) casualties did not necessitate immediate medical 
      treatment. CONCLUSION: Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed 
      number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of 
      the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation 
      of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health 
      resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.
