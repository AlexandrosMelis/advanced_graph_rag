TI  - Doppler examination of uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy: can it 
      predict adverse outcome?
PG  - 382-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether spectral Doppler measurements obtained from 
      bilateral uterine, arcuate, radial, and spiral arteries in early gestation 
      correlate with adverse pregnancy outcome. METHODS: One hundred five pregnant 
      women underwent transvaginal Doppler sonographic examination of uteroplacental 
      circulation at 6-12 weeks' gestation. Resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index 
      (PI) of bilateral uterine, arcuate, radial, and spiral arteries were measured. 
      Diameters of gestational sac (GS) and yolk sac, crown-rump length (CRL), GS-CRL 
      difference, and GS/CRL ratio were also recorded. Correlation was made with 
      pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: Sixteen women developed adverse pregnancy outcome. In 
      these women, right uterine artery PI and RI were significantly higher than in 
      women with normal obstetrical outcome. Spiral artery PI and RI values were also 
      higher, but the difference was not statistically significant. GS-CRL difference, 
      GS/CRL ratio, and yolk sac diameters were significantly lower in this group. 
      CONCLUSION: Transvaginal Doppler examination can detect hemodynamic changes in 
      uteroplacental circulation associated with subsequent adverse pregnancy outcome.
