TI  - Does early discharge with nurse home visits affect adequacy of newborn metabolic 
      screening?
PG  - 213-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of early discharge on newborn metabolic 
      screening. STUDY DESIGN: Metabolic screening results were obtained from the 
      Alabama State Lab for all infants born at our hospital between 8/1/97, and 
      1/31/99, and were matched with an existing database of early discharge infants. 
      An early newborn discharge was defined as a discharge between 24 and 47 hours of 
      age. Metabolic screening tests included phenylketonuria (PKU), hypothyroidism, 
      and congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Early discharge and traditional stay 
      infants were compared to determine the percentage of newborns screened and the 
      timing of the first adequate specimen. RESULTS: The state laboratory received 
      specimens from 3860 infants; 1324 were on early discharge newborns and 2536 
      infants in the traditional stay group. At least one filter paper test (PKU, 
      hypothyroidism, and CAH) was collected on 99.2% of early discharge infants and 
      96.0% of traditional stay infants (P<.0001). Early discharge infants had a higher 
      rate of initial filter paper specimens being inadequate (22.9%) compared with 
      traditional stay infants (14.3%, P<.0001) but had a higher rate of repeat 
      specimens when the initial specimen was inadequate (85.0% early discharge vs 
      75.3% traditional stay, P=.002). The early discharge group was more likely to 
      have an adequate specimen within the first 9 days of life (1001, 98.8% early 
      discharge vs 2016, 96.7% traditional stay, P=.0005). CONCLUSIONS: In this well 
      established early discharge program with nurse home visits, newborn metabolic 
      screening is not compromised by early discharge.
