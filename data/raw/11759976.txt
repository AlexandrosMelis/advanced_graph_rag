TI  - Advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma in Thai women: should we continue to offer 
      second-look laparotomy?
PG  - 958-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine survival among patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma 
      (EOC) who underwent a second-look laparotomy (SLL) and those refusing the 
      procedure. Also to analyze factor(s) influencing the survival of the patients. 
      METHOD AND MATERIAL: Medical records were reviewed of patients with advanced EOC 
      who were clinically free of disease after primary surgery and platinum-based 
      chemotherapy between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1998. All of them were 
      offered SLL. Measurement outcomes include patient survival and disease-free 
      survival. RESULTS: There were 50 patients with clinically complete remission 
      after chemotherapy. Sixteen patients underwent SLL, and thirty-four patients 
      refused the procedure (NSLL). Seven patients (43.8%) were reported to have 
      positive SLL. After the median follow-up time of 35 months, 12 patients had died, 
      and 5 patients were lost to follow-up. The median survival time for patients with 
      SLL was about 60 months. Five-year survival rates of patients in the SLL, and 
      NSLL groups were 37 per cent (95%CI = 7%-69%), and 88 per cent (95%CI = 65%-96%) 
      respectively (P<0.001). The median time to relapse was about 25 months for 
      patients with negative SLL. Five-year disease-free survival rates of patients in 
      the negative SLL, and NSLL groups were 28 per cent (95%CI = 4%-59%), and 54 per 
      cent (95%CI = 34%-70%) respectively (P=0.251). By Cox regression analysis, tumor 
      grade was the only significant prognostic factor influencing patients' survival 
      (HR = 6, 95%CI of HR = 1.2-34.2). CONCLUSION: The second-look laparotomy doesn't 
      have a favorable impact on overall and disease-free survival. Tumor grade is the 
      only independent prognostic variable for survival of the patients.
