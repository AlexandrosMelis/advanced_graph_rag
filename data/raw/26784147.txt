TI  - Target Serum Urate: Do Gout Patients Know Their Goal?
PG  - 1028-35
LID - 10.1002/acr.22785 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine gout patients' knowledge of their condition, including the 
      central role of achieving and maintaining the serum urate (SU) goal with the use 
      of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). METHODS: This study of 612 gout patients was 
      conducted at a Veterans Affairs medical center. Gout patients were included based 
      on administrative diagnostic codes and receipt of at least 1 allopurinol 
      prescription over a 1-year period. Questionnaires were mailed to patients and 
      linked to medical records data. The questionnaire included gout-specific 
      knowledge questions, the Patient Activation Measure, and self-reported health 
      outcomes. Knowledge was assessed descriptively. Multivariable logistic regression 
      was used to determine predictors of SU goal knowledge. Associations of knowledge 
      with health outcomes were examined in exploratory analyses. RESULTS: The 
      questionnaire had a 62% response rate. Only 14% of patients knew their SU goal, 
      while the majority answered correctly for the other 5 gout-specific knowledge 
      questions. In adjusted analyses, having a rheumatologist as initial prescriber 
      (odds ratio [OR] 3.0 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.4-6.2]) and knowing all 
      of the other 5 gout-specific knowledge questions (OR 2.1 [95% CI 1.3-3.4]) were 
      associated with greater odds of knowing the SU goal. SU goal knowledge was 
      associated with self-reported global health status, but not with self-reported 
      health-related quality of life or gout-specific health status. CONCLUSION: There 
      is a knowledge deficit regarding the SU treatment goal among gout patients 
      receiving ULT, despite generally high levels of other gout-specific knowledge. SU 
      goal information may be an important and underutilized concept among providers 
      treating gout patients.
