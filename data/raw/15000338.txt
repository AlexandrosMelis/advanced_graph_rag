TI  - Do family physicians know the costs of medical care? Survey in British Columbia.
PG  - 263-70
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost of 46 commonly used investigations and therapies 
      and to assess British Columbia family doctors' awareness of these costs. DESIGN: 
      Mailed survey asking about costs of 23 investigations and 23 therapies relevant 
      to family practice. A random sample of 600 doctors was asked to report their 
      awareness of costs and to estimate costs of the 46 items. SETTING: British 
      Columbia. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred family physicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Estimates within 25% of actual cost were considered correct. Associations between 
      cost awareness and respondents'characteristics (eg, sex, practice location) were 
      sought. Degree of error in estimates was also assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 283 
      (47.2%) surveys were returned and 259 analyzed. Few respondents estimated costs 
      within 25% of true cost, and estimates were highly variable. Physicians 
      underestimated costs of expensive drugs and laboratory investigations and 
      overestimated costs of inexpensive drugs. Cost awareness did not correlate with 
      sex, practice location, College certification, faculty appointment, or years in 
      practice. CONCLUSION: Family doctors in British Columbia have little awareness of 
      the costs of medical care.
