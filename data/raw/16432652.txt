TI  - Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy: is it possible?
PG  - 522-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously reported the feasibility of diagnostic and 
      therapeutic peritoneoscopy including liver biopsy, gastrojejunostomy, and tubal 
      ligation by an oral transgastric approach. We present results of per-oral 
      transgastric splenectomy in a porcine model. The goal of this study was to 
      determine the technical feasibility of per-oral transgastric splenectomy using a 
      flexible endoscope. METHODS: We performed acute experiments on 50-kg pigs. All 
      animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were 
      performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible 
      endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall 
      was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm 
      incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was 
      advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with 
      air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were 
      ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using 
      electrocautery. RESULTS: Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There 
      were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal 
      cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very 
      good. Ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen were 
      achieved using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy in a porcine model appears 
      technically feasible. Additional long-term survival experiments are planned.
