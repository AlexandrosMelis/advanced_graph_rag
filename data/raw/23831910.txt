TI  - Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting?
PG  - 205-10
AB  - AIM: Double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) has been extensively used in tertiary 
      referral centers but little literature exists on the efficacy, complications and 
      outcomes of patients undergoing DBE in the community setting. We present our 
      findings regarding the use of DBE in a community hospital. METHODS: From March 
      2007 to January 2011, 88 DBE procedures were performed on 66 patients. 
      Indications included evaluation anemia/gastrointestinal bleed, small bowel IBD 
      and dilation of strictures. Video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) was used prior to DBE 
      in 43 of the 66 patients prior to DBE evaluation. RESULTS: The mean age was 62 
      years. Thirty-two patients were female, 15 were African-American; 44 antegrade 
      and 44 retrograde DBEs were performed. The mean time per antegrade DBE was 
      107.4+/-30.0 minutes with a distance of 318.4+/-152.9 cm reached past the pylorus. 
      The mean time per lower DBE was 100.7+/-27.3 minutes with 168.9+/-109.1 cm meters 
      past the ileocecal valve reached. Endoscopic therapy in the form of 
      electrocautery to ablate bleeding sources was performed in 20 patients (30.3%), 
      biopsy in 17 patients (25.8%) and dilation of Crohn's-related small bowel 
      strictures in 4 (6.1%). 43 VCEs with pathology noted were performed prior to DBE, 
      with findings endoscopically confirmed in 32 cases (74.4%). In 3 cases the DBE 
      showed findings not noted on VCE. CONCLUSION: DBE appears to be equally safe and 
      effective when performed in the community setting as compared to a tertiary 
      referral center with a comparable yield, efficacy, and complication rate.
