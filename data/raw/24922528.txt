AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the extent to which parent-adolescent emotional closeness, 
      family conflict, and parental permissiveness moderate the association of puberty 
      and alcohol use in adolescents (aged 10-14). METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 
      7631 adolescents from 231 Australian schools. Measures included pubertal status, 
      recent (30day) alcohol use, parent-adolescent emotional closeness, family 
      conflict, parental permissiveness of alcohol use and peer alcohol use. The 
      analysis was based on a two-level (individuals nested within schools) logistic 
      regression model, with main effects entered first, and interaction terms added 
      second. RESULTS: The interaction of family factors and pubertal stage did not 
      improve the fit of the model, so a main effect model of family factors and 
      pubertal stage was adopted. There were significant main effects for pubertal 
      stage with boys in middle puberty at increased odds of alcohol use, and girls in 
      advanced puberty at increased odds of alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: Puberty and 
      family factors were strong predictors of adolescent alcohol use, but family 
      factors did not account for variation in the association of pubertal stage and 
      alcohol use.
