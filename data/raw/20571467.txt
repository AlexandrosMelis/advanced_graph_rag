AB  - BACKGROUND: Kidneys from elderly donors tend to be implanted in recipients who 
      are also elderly. We present the results obtained after 10 years of evolution on 
      transplanting elderly kidneys into young recipients. METHODS: Ninety-one 
      consecutive transplants are studied, carried out in our center with kidneys from 
      cadaver donors older than 60 years implanted in recipients younger than 60 years. 
      The control group is made up of 91 transplants, matched with those from the study 
      group, whose donor and recipient were younger than 60 years. RESULTS: There were 
      no differences between groups with regard to recipient age, sex, cause of death 
      and renal function of the donor, hepatitis C and cytomegalovirus serologies, cold 
      ischemia time, tubular necrosis, immediate diuresis, need for dialysis, human 
      leukocyte antigen incompatibilities, hypersensitized patients, acute rejection, 
      waiting time on dialysis, and days of admission. Survival in both groups at 1, 5, 
      and 10 years was 97.6%, 87.2%, and 76.6% vs. 98.8%, 87.5%, and 69.5% for the 
      patient (P=0.642), 92.9%, 81.3%, and 64.2% vs. 93.9%, 76.4%, and 69.5% for the 
      graft (P=0.980), and 94.4%, 92.6%, and 77.4% vs. 94.3%, 86.7%, and 84.4% for the 
      graft with death censured (P=0.747), respectively. Creatininaemias at 1, 5, and 
      10 years were 172, 175, and 210 vs. 139, 134, and 155 (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We 
      conclude that patient and graft survival on transplanting kidneys from elderly 
      donors to young recipients is superimposable on that obtained with young donors. 
      However, renal function is better in the group of young donors.
