AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the perinatal predictors of discordant screening outcomes 
      based on a two-stage screening protocol with transient-evoked otoacoustic 
      emissions (TEOAE) and automated auditory brainstem response (AABR). METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study of infants tested with TEOAE and AABR under a 
      hospital-based universal newborn hearing screening program in Lagos, Nigeria. 
      Maternal and infant factors associated with discordant TEOAE and AABR outcomes 
      were determined with multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusting for 
      potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Of the 4718 infants enrolled under the 
      program 1745 (36.9%) completed both TEOAE and AABR. Of this group, 1060 (60.7%) 
      passed both TEOAE and AABR ("true-negatives"); 92 (5.3%) failed both TEOAE and 
      AABR ("true-positive"); 571 (32.7%) failed TEOAE but passed AABR 
      ("false-positives") while 22 (1.3%) passed TEOAE but failed AABR 
      ("false-negatives"). Infants with false-positives were likely to be admitted into 
      well-baby nursery (p=0.001), belong to mothers who attended antenatal care 
      (p=0.010) or who delivered vaginally (p<0.001) compared to infants with 
      true-negatives while infants with true-positives were also more likely to be 
      delivered vaginally (p=0.002) or admitted into well-baby nursery (p=0.035) 
      compared to infants with false-negatives. Infants with true-positives were 
      significantly more likely to be delivered vaginally (p<0.001) and have severe 
      hyperbilirubinemia (p=0.045) compared with infants with true-negatives. No 
      association was observed between false-negatives and true-negatives. Antenatal 
      care status, mode of delivery and nursery type were useful predictors of 
      discordant outcomes among all infants undergoing screening (c-statistic=0.73). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the available screening technologies, discordant TEOAE and 
      AABR may be inevitable for some categories of hearing loss among apparently 
      healthy newborns whose mothers received prenatal care. The potential limitations 
      of perinatal morbidities as basis of targeted screening for such cases therefore 
      merit further consideration.
