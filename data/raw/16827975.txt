TI  - [Chemotherapy and survival in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma: is 
      pneumologists' skepticism justified?].
PG  - 273-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few studies have assessed whether the advantage chemotherapy has been 
      shown to have in treating advanced non-small lung carcinoma in clinical trials is 
      transferrable to normal health care activity. This could explain the skepticism 
      of a large number of pneumologists towards this treatment. The objective of our 
      study was to analyze prognostic factors related to survival and to see whether 
      cytostatic treatment was an independent predictor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 
      enrolled in the study had been diagnosed with non-small cell carcinoma in stages 
      IV or IIIB with pleural or N2-N3 involvement and with a performance status of 2 
      or below according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Survival was 
      analyzed with regard to the following variables: age, sex, comorbidity, weight 
      loss, laboratory test results, histological type, ECOG score, TNM staging, and 
      treatment. The Student t test, the chi(2) test, the Kaplan-Meier method, the 
      log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were used in the statistical analysis. 
      RESULTS: We enrolled 190 patients (157 men and 33 women) with a mean (SD) age of 
      61.75 (10.85) years (range, 33-85 years). Of these patients, 144 received 
      cytostatic treatment and 46 palliative treatment. The median survival was 31 
      weeks and was related to absence of weight loss (hazard ratio [HR], 1.73; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.26-2.39; P=.001), cytostatic treatment (HR, 1.85; 95% 
      CI, 1.25-2.76; P=.002), and ECOG score of 0 to 1 (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.62-5.00; 
      P=.0001). In patients with ECOG scores of 0 to 1, weight loss and treatment were 
      significant prognostic factors. Survival in the ECOG 2 group was 15 weeks for 
      patients undergoing cytostatic treatment and 11 weeks for patients with 
      symptomatic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In normal clinical practice, chemotherapy 
      significantly prolongs survival in patients with performance status of less than 
      2, more time being gained if there is no associated weight loss. We conclude that 
      the reluctance shown by many pneumologists toward using this treatment is not 
      entirely justified.
