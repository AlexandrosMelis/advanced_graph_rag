TI  - Does receipt of hospice care in nursing homes improve the management of pain at 
      the end of life?
PG  - 507-15
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare analgesic management of daily pain for dying nursing home 
      residents enrolled and not enrolled in Medicare hospice. DESIGN: Retrospective, 
      comparative cohort study. SETTING: Over 800 nursing homes in Kansas, Maine, 
      Mississippi, New York, and South Dakota. PARTICIPANTS: A subset of residents with 
      daily pain near the end of life taken from a matched cohort of hospice (2,644) 
      and nonhospice (7,929) nursing home residents who had at least two resident 
      assessments (Minimum Data Sets (MDSs)) completed, their last between 1992 and 
      1996, and who died before April 1997. The daily pain subset consisted of 709 
      hospice and 1,326 nonhospice residents. MEASUREMENTS: Detailed drug use data 
      contained on the last MDS before death were used to examine analgesic management 
      of daily pain. Guidelines from the American Medical Directors Association (AMDA) 
      were used to identify analgesics not recommended for use in managing chronic pain 
      in long-term care settings. The study outcome, regular treatment of daily pain, 
      examined whether patients received any analgesic, other than those not 
      recommended by AMDA, at least twice a day for each day of documented daily pain 
      (i.e., 7 days before date of last MDS). RESULTS: Fifteen percent of hospice 
      residents and 23% of nonhospice residents in daily pain received no analgesics 
      (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.45-0.74). A lower 
      proportion of hospice residents (21%) than of nonhospice residents (29%) received 
      analgesics not recommended by AMDA (OR = 0.65, 95% CI =0.52-0.80). Overall, 
      acetaminophen (not in combination with other drugs) was used most frequently for 
      nonhospice residents (25% of 1,673 prescriptions), whereas morphine derivatives 
      were used most frequently for hospice residents (30% of 1,058 prescriptions). 
      Fifty-one percent of hospice residents and 33% of nonhospice residents received 
      regular treatment for daily pain. Controlling for clinical confounders, hospice 
      residents were twice as likely as nonhospice residents to receive regular 
      treatment for daily pain (adjusted odds ratio = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.68-2.56). 
      CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that analgesic management of daily pain is better 
      for nursing home residents enrolled in hospice than for those not enrolled in 
      hospice.The prescribing practices portrayed by this study reveal that many dying 
      nursing home residents in daily pain are receiving no analgesic treatment or are 
      receiving analgesic treatment inconsistent with AMDA and other pain management 
      guidelines. Improving the analgesic management of pain in nursing homes is 
      essential if high-quality end-of-life care in nursing homes is to be achieved.
