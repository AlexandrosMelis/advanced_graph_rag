TI  - Can Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator provide adequate and 
      safe manual inflations for infants up to 10 kg weight?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Manual resuscitation devices for infants and newborns must be able to 
      provide adequate ventilation in a safe and consistent manner across a wide range 
      of patient sizes (0.5-10 kg) and differing clinical states. There are little 
      comparative data assessing biomechanical performance of common infant manual 
      resuscitation devices across the manufacturers' recommended operating weight 
      ranges. We aimed to compare performance of the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) with 
      the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator in three resuscitation models. METHODS: Five 
      experienced clinicians delivered targeted ventilation to three lung models 
      differing in compliance, delivery pressures and inflation rates; Preterm 
      (0.5 mL/cmH(2)O, 25/5 cmH(2)O, 60 per minute), Term (3 mL/cmH(2)O, 30/5 cmH(2)O, 
      40 per minute) and Infant (9 mL/cmH(2)O, 35/5 cmH(2)O, 30 per minute). The 
      Neopuff was examined with three gas inflow rates (5 litres per minute (LPM), 10 
      LPM and 15 LPM) and the Ambu with no gas inflow. RESULTS: 3309 inflations were 
      collected and analysed with analysis of variance for repeated measures. The 
      Neopuff was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited seriously 
      elevated positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) with all inflow gas rates 
      (p<0.001) in this infant model. The Ambu SIB accurately delivered targeted 
      pressures in all three models. CONCLUSIONS: The Ambu SIB was able to accurately 
      deliver targeted pressures across all three models from preterm to infant. The 
      Neopuff infant resuscitator was unable to deliver the targeted pressures in the 
      infant model developing clinically significant levels of inadvertent PEEP which 
      may pose risk during infant resuscitation.
