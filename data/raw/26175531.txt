TI  - Is Aspiration Thrombectomy Beneficial in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous 
      Coronary Intervention? Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or 
      ischemic time might modify any clinical benefits observed with aspiration 
      thrombectomy before primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients 
      with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic 
      databases were searched for trials that randomized ST-segment-elevation 
      myocardial infarction patients to aspiration thrombectomy before PCI versus 
      conventional PCI. Summary estimates were constructed using a DerSimonian-Laird 
      model. Seventeen trials with 20 960 patients were available for analysis. When 
      compared with conventional PCI, aspiration thrombectomy was not associated with a 
      significant reduction in the risk of mortality 2.8% versus 3.2% (risk ratio [RR], 
      0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.04; P=0.13), reinfarction 1.3% versus 
      1.4% (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73-1.17; P=0.52), the combined outcome of mortality or 
      reinfarction 4.1% versus 4.6% (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79-1.02; P=0.11), or stent 
      thrombosis 0.9% versus 1.2% (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.62-1.08; P=0.15). Aspiration 
      thrombectomy was associated with a nonsignificant increase in the risk of stroke 
      0.6% versus 0.4% (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 0.96-2.21; P=0.08). Meta-regression analysis 
      did not identify a difference for the log RR of mortality, reinfarction, and the 
      combined outcome of mortality or reinfarction with intravenous glycoprotein 
      IIb/IIIa inhibitors (P=0.17, 0.70, and 0.50, respectively) or with ischemic time 
      (P=0.29, 0.66, and 0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Aspiration thrombectomy 
      before primary PCI is not associated with any benefit on clinical end points and 
      might increase the risk of stroke. Concomitant administration of intravenous 
      glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and ischemic time did not seem to influence any 
      potential benefits observed with aspiration thrombectomy.
