AB  - AIM: To inform that Actinobaculum schaalii can colonize the urine and cause 
      urinary tract infection in children. METHODS: Urine samples were examined by wet 
      smear microscopy, incubated in 5% CO(2) for 1-2 days, and species-specific 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for A. schaalii was performed. RESULTS: 
      In 5 of the 29 screened urines, A. schaalii was found only by real-time PCR in 
      quantities equivalent to >/= 10(4) -10(5) CFU/mL. In addition, A. schaalii was 
      found in quantities equivalent to >/= 10(6) CFU/mL by both culture and PCR in two 
      children with a urinary tract infection and large numbers of leucocytes in the 
      urine. CONCLUSION: Actinobaculum schaalii is CO(2)-dependent. Therefore, if there 
      are clinical symptoms and/or a negative culture despite the presence of 
      leucocytes in the urine, Gram staining and incubation in 5% CO(2) or 
      species-specific real-time PCR should be performed to identify A. schaalii.
