      rate also relevant?

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Elevated resting heart rate (RHR) is a neglected marker in 
      cardiovascular risk factor studies of sub-Saharan African populations. This study 
      aimed to determine the prevalence of elevated RHR and other risk factors for 
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to investigate any associations between RHR and 
      these risk factors in a rural population in Ghana. DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      analysis. METHODS: A total of 574 adults aged between 18-65 years were randomly 
      sampled from a population register. Data collected included those on 
      sociodemographic variables and anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), and RHR 
      measurements. Within-person variability in RHR was calculated using data from 
      repeat measurements taken 2 weeks apart. RESULTS: Of study participants, 36% were 
      male. Prevalence of casual high BP was 19%. In the population, 10% were current 
      cigarette smokers and habitual alcohol use was high at 56%. As measured by body 
      mass index, 2% were obese and 14% had abdominal obesity. RHR was elevated (>90 
      bpm) in 19%. Overall, 79% of study participants were found to have at least one 
      CVD risk factor. RHR was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, 
      and BP. Individuals with an elevated RHR had a higher risk (OR 1.94, 95% CI 
      1.15-3.26%, p = 0.013) of casual high BP compared with participants with normal 
      RHR independently of several established CVD risk factors. The regression 
      dilution ratio of RHR was 0.75 (95% CI 0.62-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Significant 
      associations were observed between RHR and several established cardiovascular 
      risk factors. Prospective studies are needed in sub-Saharan African populations 
      to establish the potential value of RHR in cardiovascular risk assessment.
