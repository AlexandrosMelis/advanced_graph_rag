AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence against its utility, many surgeons continue to 
      employ prophylactic nasogastric decompression in elective colonic resection. This 
      study aimed to establish whether an easy and practical intervention, mailing out 
      a summary of current evidence to surgeons, can change surgeons practice to bring 
      it more in line with current evidence. METHODS: The use of prophylactic 
      nasogastric (NG) decompression in elective colonic resections was documented for 
      the 2 consecutive months of October and November, 2004 at the Royal Alexandra 
      Hospital (RAH). A one page summary of recent evidence concerning this practice 
      was then mailed to all general surgeons at that institution. A similar second 
      review was carried out for the months of January and February, 2005. The two 
      periods were compared with regards to prophylactic NG use. RESULTS: Twenty two 
      patients underwent elective colonic resections during the months of October and 
      November, 2004. Twenty one patients underwent such procedures in January and 
      February, 2005. Seven out of the 22 cases in the first group (the 
      pre-intervention block) received prophylactic NG decompression. Five out of the 
      21 cases in the second group (the post-intervention block) received prophylactic 
      NG decompression. The difference in prophylactic NG use between the two groups 
      was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that mailing 
      out a summary of current evidence to surgeons concerning a certain issue is not 
      sufficient to lead to a change in practice.
