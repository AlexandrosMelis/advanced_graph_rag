TI  - Are physicians aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      inhibitors?: a questionnaire survey in different medical categories.
PG  - 976-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are considered 
      safe, but they are associated with characteristic side effects, namely cough and 
      angioedema, usually requiring discontinuation. We perceived that referrals for 
      these side effects have become more and more frequent; therefore, we evaluated 
      the degree of knowledge on the safety of ACE-I in different medical categories. 
      DESIGN: A questionnaire (13 questions) on side effects of ACE-I was posted to 
      physicians. SETTING: Everyday clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: Cardiologists, 
      allergists, and general practitioners (GPs) from the National Healthcare System. 
      MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: Three hundred twelve physicians were contacted, and 154 
      returned questionnaires that could be analyzed. Of the 154 physicians (mean age, 
      45 years) 48 were cardiologists, 52 were GPs, and 54 were allergists. The 
      percentage of correct answers was low: 31.9% for cardiologists, 40% for GPs, and 
      33% for allergists. Thus, GPs provided a significantly higher percentage of 
      correct answers with respect to the remaining categories (p = 0.05). The lower 
      rate of correct answers (0 to 15.9%) concerned the time of onset of cough and the 
      action to take. Cardiologists seemed to be less aware of the fact that 
      angiotensin receptor blockers (sartans) can cross-react with ACE-I. CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, there was a poor knowledge of the side effects of ACE-I. This may 
      account for the increased referrals for chronic cough and angioedema.
