TI  - Discharging patients earlier from Winnipeg hospitals: does it adversely affect 
      quality of care?
PG  - 745-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether decreasing lengths of stay over time for selected 
      diagnostic categories were associated with increased hospital readmission rates 
      and mean number of physician visits after discharge. DESIGN: Retrospective 
      descriptive study. SETTING: The seven large (125 beds or more) acute care 
      hospitals in Winnipeg. PATIENTS: Manitoba residents admitted to any one of the 
      seven hospitals because acute myocardial infarction (AMI), bronchitis or asthma, 
      transurethral prostatectomy (TURP) and uterine or adnexal procedures for 
      nonmalignant disease during the fiscal years 1989-90 to 1992-93. Patients from 
      out of province, those who died in hospital, those with excessively long stays 
      (more than 60 days) and those who were transferred to or from another institution 
      were excluded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Length of hospital stay, and rate of readmission 
      within 30 days after discharge for all four categories and mean number of 
      physician visits within 30 days after discharge for two categories (AMI and 
      bronchitis or asthma. RESULTS: The length of stay decreased significantly over 
      the 4 years for all of the four categories, the smallest change being observed 
      for patients with AMI (11.1%) and the largest for those with bronchitis or asthma 
      (22.0%). The readmission rates for AMI, bronchitis or asthma, and TURP showed no 
      consistent change over the 4 years. The readmission rate for uterine or adnexal 
      procedures increased significantly between the first and second year (chi 2 = 
      4.28, p = 0.04) but then remained constant over the next 3 years. The mean number 
      of physician visits increased slightly for AMI in the first year (1.92 to 2.01) 
      and then remained virtually the same. It decreased slightly for bronchitis or 
      asthma over the 4 years. There was no significant correlation between length of 
      stay and readmission rates for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in any of the four 
      categories. Also, no correlation was observed between length of stay and mean 
      number of physician visits for individual hospitals in 1992-93 in the categories 
      AMI and bronchitis or asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Improving hospital efficiency by 
      shortening length of stay does not appear to result in increased rates of 
      readmission or numbers of physician visits within 30 days after discharge from 
      hospital. Research is needed to identify optimal lengths of stay and expected 
      readmission rates.
