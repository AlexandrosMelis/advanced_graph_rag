AB  - BACKGROUND: It is now widely accepted that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is 
      a critical regulator of energy homeostasis. Recently, it has been shown to 
      regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the 
      circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, 
      as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of 
      reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of 
      AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal 
      pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated 
      if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, 
      metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were 
      housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored 
      as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. 
      AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a 
      downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine 
      pathway to the pineal gland. RESULTS: All the subunits of AMPK that we studied 
      were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences 
      in their level of expression among structures. Metformin and AICAR both reduced 
      (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively) the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of 
      melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion. The i.c.v. injection of 
      AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the 
      paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated 
      ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p < 0.001) and in the pineal gland (p < 
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for 
      AMPK on the secretion of melatonin probably acting trough the paraventricular 
      nucleus and/or directly in the pineal gland. We conclude that AMPK may act as a 
      metabolic cue to modulate the rhythm of melatonin secretion.
