      surgery?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation, which occurs in 12% of all major foregut 
      surgeries, can prolong hospital stay and increase morbidity. Minimally invasive 
      techniques in foregut surgery have been suggested to cause less tissue trauma. We 
      examined the factors associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation after foregut 
      surgery at our institution. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the records of 
      154 adult patients who underwent major foregut surgery which included 
      esophagectomy, partial or total gastrectomy, redo Heller myotomy, redo or 
      transthoracic fundoplications. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression 
      analysis with standard modeling techniques were performed to determine risk 
      factors for new-onset atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: Of the 154 patients, 14 
      patients developed new-onset atrial fibrillation with a higher mean age of 67.1 
      years (+/-8.8 years) versus 56.4 years (+/-14.1 years) (p = 0.006). Laparoscopic 
      (p = 0.004) and nonthoracic surgeries (p = 0.01) were associated with lower risk 
      of atrial fibrillation. Patients with atrial fibrillation had received more fluid 
      (6.5 +/- 2.8 liters versus 5.3 +/- 2.0 liters) and had longer operations (370 +/- 
      103 min versus 362 +/- 142 min), none of which were statistically significant. 
      The average intensive care length of stay of patients was longer: 7.5 +/- 6.8 
      days versus 4.0 +/- 7.1 days (p = 0.004). Multivariate analysis revealed an 
      association of atrial fibrillation with age (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14, p = 
      0.01), and laparoscopic surgery (OR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01-0.95, p = 0.04) after 
      adjusting for surgery type. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery is associated with 
      lower risk of atrial fibrillation in foregut surgery. Development of atrial 
      fibrillation is associated with increased length of intensive care stay. We 
      recommend a prospective trial to confirm our findings.
