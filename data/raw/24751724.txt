AB  - BACKGROUND: Ageing is a growing issue for people from UK black, Asian and 
      minority ethnic (BAME) groups. The health experiences of these groups are 
      recognised as a 'tracer' to measure success in end of life patient-preferred 
      outcomes that includes place of death (PoD). AIM: To examine patterns in PoD 
      among BAME groups who died of cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mortality data for 
      93,375 cancer deaths of those aged >/=65 years in London from 2001-2010 were 
      obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). Decedent's country of 
      birth was used as a proxy for ethnicity. Linear regression examined trends in 
      place of death across the eight ethnic groups and Poisson regression examined the 
      association between country of birth and place of death. RESULTS: 76% decedents 
      were born in the UK, followed by Ireland (5.9%), Europe(5.4%) and 
      Caribbean(4.3%). Most deaths(52.5%) occurred in hospital, followed by 
      home(18.7%). During the study period, deaths in hospital declined with an 
      increase in home deaths; trend for time analysis for those born in 
      UK(0.50%/yr[0.36-0.64%]p<0.001), Europe (1.00%/yr[0.64-1.30%]p<0.001), 
      Asia(1.09%/yr[0.94-1.20%]p<0.001) and Caribbean(1.03%/yr[0.72-1.30%]p<0.001). 
      However, time consistent gaps across the geographical groups remained. Following 
      adjustment hospital deaths were more likely for those born in Asia(Proportion 
      ratio(PR)1.12[95%CI1.08-1.15]p<0.001) and Africa(PR 1.11[95%CI1.07-1.16]p<0.001). 
      Hospice deaths were less likely for those born in Asia(PR 0.73 [0.68-0.80] 
      p<0.001), Africa (PR 0.83[95%CI0.74-0.93]p<0.001), and 'other' geographical 
      regions (PR0.90[95% 0.82-0.98]p<0.001). Home deaths were less likely for those 
      born in the Caribbean(PR0.91[95%CI 0.85-0.98]p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Location of 
      death varies by country of birth. BAME groups are more likely to die in a 
      hospital and less likely to die at home or in a hospice. Further investigation is 
      needed to determine whether these differences result from patient-centred 
      preferences, or other environment or service-related factors. This knowledge will 
      enable strategies to be developed to improve access to relevant palliative care 
      and related services, where necessary.
