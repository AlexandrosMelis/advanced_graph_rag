AB  - BACKGROUND: Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form 
      has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among 
      human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients. OBJECTIVES: This is a 
      cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated 
      fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in 
      antiretroviral therapy. METHOD: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was 
      used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with >/=2 active antiretroviral medications. 
      Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity 
      scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were 
      included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. 
      Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual 
      estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte 
      Carlo probabilistic simulation technique. RESULTS: Nine FXD antiretroviral 
      formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was 
      included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with >/=2 
      antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n=92) 
      were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the 
      FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were 
      observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD 
      patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD 
      over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. 
      The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted 
      life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC 
      (>50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold. 
      CONCLUSION: Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within 
      the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. 
      Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy.
