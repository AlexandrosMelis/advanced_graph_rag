TI  - Are even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively associated with 
      increased mortality after CABG surgery?
PG  - 1513-8
AB  - AIMS: Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes 
      mellitus (DM) is associated with macrovascular pathology and increased mortality 
      after percutaneous coronary interventions. The study goal was to determine 
      whether pre-operative fasting blood glucose (fB-glu) is associated with an 
      increased mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: During 2001-03, 1895 patients underwent primary CABG [clinical DM (CDM) 
      in 440/1895; complete data on fB-glu for n=1375/1455]. Using pre-operative 
      fB-glu, non-diabetics were categorized as having normal fB-glu (<5.6 mmol/L), IFG 
      (5.6< or =fB-glu<6.1 mmol/L), or suspected DM (SDM) (> or =6.1 mmol/L). fB-glu 
      was normal in 59%. The relative risks of 30 day and 1 year mortality compared 
      with patients with normal fB-glu was 1.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5-5.5] 
      and 2.9 (CI: 0.8-11.2) with IFG, 2.8 (CI: 1.1-7.2) and 1.9 (CI: 0.5-6.3) with SDM 
      vs. 1.8 (CI: 0.8-4.0) and 1.6 (CI: 0.6-4.3) if CDM, respectively. The receiver 
      operator characteristic area for the continuous variable fB-glu and 1 year 
      mortality was 0.65 (P=0.002). CONCLUSION: The elevated risk of death after CABG 
      surgery known previously to be associated with CDM seems also to be shared by a 
      group of similar size that includes patients with IFG and undiagnosed DM.
