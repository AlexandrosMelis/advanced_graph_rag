TI  - [Are there associations of health status, disease activity and damage in SLE 
      patients?---Results of a study of a cohort of a Swiss specialized outpatient 
      clinic].
PG  - 895-9
AB  - AIM: To study the relationship between self assessed health status of patients 
      with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), lupus activity, damage, patients' age 
      and disease duration in a cohort of a Swiss specialized outpatient clinic. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study of 38 patients fulfilling the 
      classification criteria for SLE. The patients visited a rheumatology outpatient 
      clinic in Switzerland between January 2002 and December 2004. The last assessment 
      during this period was used for the study. The assessment included, besides 
      demographic data, the measurement of disease activity using the BILAG index, the 
      measurement of disease damage using the SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI), as well as 
      the patient's self assessed health status using the patient's questionnaire 
      Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 36 (SF-36). RESULTS: A total of 36 women and 2 
      men were included in the study (median age: 43 yrs, median disease duration: 11 
      yrs). Increased disease activity (total BILAG) was shown to be significantly 
      correlated with reduced physical function. A greater damage (total SDI) 
      correlated significantly with reduced role function due to emotional limitations. 
      Neither age nor disease duration showed any significant correlation with health 
      status in this study. CONCLUSION: The present study, which is based on 
      internationally accepted assessment tools for SLE patients, shows a significant 
      relationship between increased disease activity and reduced physical function. 
      This result emphasizes the importance of optimizing treatment aiming at reducing 
      disease activity.
