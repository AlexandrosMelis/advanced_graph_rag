TI  - Is distance to provider a barrier to care for medicaid patients with breast, 
      colorectal, or lung cancer?

AB  - PURPOSE: Distance to provider might be an important barrier to timely diagnosis 
      and treatment for cancer patients who qualify for Medicaid coverage. Whether 
      driving time or driving distance is a better indicator of travel burden is also 
      of interest. METHODS: Driving distances and times from patient residence to 
      primary care provider were calculated for 3,917 breast, colorectal (CRC) and lung 
      cancer Medicaid patients in Washington State from 1997 to 2003 using 
      MapQuest.com. We fitted regression models of stage at diagnosis and 
      time-to-treatment (number of days between diagnosis and surgery) to test the 
      hypothesis that travel burden is associated with timely diagnosis and treatment 
      of cancer. FINDINGS: Later stage at diagnosis for breast cancer Medicaid patients 
      is associated with travel burden (OR = 1.488 per 100 driving miles, P= .037 and 
      OR = 1.270 per driving hour, P= .016). Time-to-treatment after diagnosis of CRC 
      is also associated with travel burden (14.57 days per 100 driving miles, P= .002 
      and 5.86 days per driving hour, P= .018). CONCLUSIONS: Although travel burden is 
      associated with timely diagnosis and treatment for some types of cancer, we did 
      not find evidence that driving time was, in general, better at predicting 
      timeliness of cancer diagnosis and treatment than driving distance. More 
      intensive efforts at early detection of breast cancer and early treatment of CRC 
      for Medicaid patients who live in remote areas may be needed.
