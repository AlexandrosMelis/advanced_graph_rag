TI  - Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a 
      better predictor than age and FSH?
PG  - 151-5
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine if baseline antral follicle 
      assessment may serve as additional information in predicting in vitro 
      fertilization outcome. METHODS: Prospective, descriptive preliminary study of in 
      vitro fertilization outcome. From July 1998 to July 1999, 224 patients underwent 
      antral follicle assessment (follicle 2-6 mm in diameter) on baseline of the 
      planned, stimulated in vitro fertilization cycle. The outcomes were analyzed with 
      respect to antral follicle assessment (< or = 6 or > 6), basal cycle day 3 
      follicle stimulated hormone (< or = 10 or > 10 IU/L) and maternal age (< or = 35 
      or > 35 years). RESULTS: The clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in 
      the group with baseline antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with 
      antral follicle < or = 6 (51% vs. 19%, respectively). Controlling for patient 
      age, and basal follicle stimulated hormone, the pregnancy rate was significantly 
      higher in the group with antral follicle > 6 compared to that in the group with 
      antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly increased with 
      advancing maternal age, elevated basal follicle stimulated hormone levels, and 
      baseline antral follicle < or = 6. The cancellation rate was significantly higher 
      in the group with antral follicle < or = 6 compared to that in the group with 
      antral follicle > or = 6 (33% vs. 1%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In vitro 
      fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal 
      cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral 
      follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than 
      were age or follicle stimulated hormone. Antral follicle assessment may provide a 
      marker for ovarian age that is distinct from chronological age or hormonal 
      markers.
