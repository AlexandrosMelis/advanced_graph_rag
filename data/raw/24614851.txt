      involvement associated with the neurological prognosis?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to clarify the prognostic factors for 
      cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA). METHODS: The authors retrospectively 
      reviewed the medical records of 47 consecutive patients with CSA in whom the 
      presence/absence of the pyramidal tract sign was noted. We analyzed whether the 
      age, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, medication (vitamin B12), type of the 
      most atrophic and impaired muscle, the muscle strength at the presentation, the 
      presence of the pyramidal tract sign, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, 
      including the presence and number of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) in 
      the spinal cord and the conversion to surgery were associated with the recovery 
      of muscle strength in the patients. In addition, we also investigated whether the 
      duration of symptoms before surgery and the type of surgery were associated with 
      the recovery of muscle strength in patients who required conversion to surgical 
      treatment. RESULTS: The presence of T2 HIA on MRI (P=0.002), the number of T2 HIA 
      on MRI (P=0.002) and conversion to surgery (P=0.015) were found to be 
      significantly associated with a poorer recovery at the observational final 
      follow-up. Further, the presence of the pyramidal tract sign (P=0.043) was 
      significantly associated with a poor recovery at the final follow-up after 
      surgery. CONCLUSION: The presence of a high signal intensity change on 
      T2-weighted MRI and the pyramidal tract sign can be used as prognostic factors 
      for patients with CSA.
