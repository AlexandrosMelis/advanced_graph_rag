AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of Florida's Medicaid Demonstration 4 years 
      post-implementation on per member per month (PMPM) Medicaid expenditures and 
      whether receiving care through HMOs versus provider service networks (PSNs) in 
      the Demonstration was associated with PMPM expenditures. DATA: Florida Medicaid 
      claims from two fiscal years prior to implementation of the Demonstration 
      (FY0405, FY0506) and the first four fiscal years after implementation 
      (FY0607-FY0910) from two urban Demonstration counties and two urban 
      non-Demonstration counties. STUDY DESIGN: A difference-in-difference approach was 
      used to compare changes in enrollee expenditures before and after implementation 
      of the Demonstration overall and specifically for HMOs and PSNs. DATA EXTRACTION: 
      Claims data were extracted for enrollees in the Demonstration and 
      non-Demonstration counties and collapsed into monthly amounts (N = 26,819,987 
      person-months). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among SSI enrollees, the Demonstration 
      resulted in lower increases in PMPM expenditures over time ($40) compared with 
      the non-Demonstration counties ($186), with Demonstration PSNs lowering PMPM 
      expenditures by $7 more than HMOs. Savings were also seen among TANF enrollees 
      but to a lesser extent. CONCLUSIONS: The Medicaid Demonstration in Florida 
      appears to result in lower PMPM expenditures. Demonstration PSNs generated 
      slightly greater reductions in expenditures compared to Demonstration HMOs. PSNs 
      appear to be a promising model for delivering care to Medicaid enrollees.
