AB  - BACKGROUND: It has recently been shown that non-high density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (non-HDL-C) may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than low 
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Based on known ethic differences in 
      lipid parameters and cardiovascular risk prediction, we sought to study the 
      predictability of attaining non-HDL-C target and long-term major adverse 
      cardiovascular event (MACE) in Thai patients after acute myocardial infarction 
      (AMI) compared to attaining LDL-C target. METHODS: We retrospectively obtained 
      the data of all patients who were admitted at Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai hospital 
      due to AMI during 2006-2013. The mean non-HDL-C and LDL-C during long-term 
      follow-up were used to predict MACE at each time point. The patients were 
      classified as target attainment if non-HDL-C <100 mg/dl and/or LDL-C <70 mg/dl. 
      The MACE was defined as combination of all-cause death, nonfatal coronary event 
      and nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: During mean follow-up of 2.6 +/- 1.6 years among 868 
      patients after AMI, 34.4% achieved non-HDL-C target, 23.7% achieved LDL-C target 
      and 21.2% experienced MACEs. LDL-C and non-HDL-C were directly compared in Cox 
      regression model. Compared with non-HDL-C <100 mg/dl, patients with non-HDL-C of 
      >130 mg/dl had higher incidence of MACEs (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.46-6.80, P = 0.003). 
      Surprisingly, LDL-C >100 mg/dl was associated with reduced risk of MACE as 
      compared to LDL <70 mg/dl (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18-0.98, p = 0.046) after direct 
      pairwise comparison with non-HDL-C level. CONCLUSIONS: Non-attaining non-HDL-C 
      goal predicted MACE at long-term follow-up after AMI whereas non-attaining LDL-C 
      goal was not associated with the higher risk. Therefore, non-HDL-C may be a more 
      suitable target of dyslipidemia treatment than LDL-C in patients after AMI.
