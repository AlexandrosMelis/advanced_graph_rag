      clinic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: National guidelines and government directives have adopted policies 
      for urgent assessment of patients with a transient ischaemic attack or minor 
      stroke not admitted to hospital. The risk of recurrent stroke increases 
      substantially with age, as does the potential benefit of secondary prevention. In 
      order to develop effective strategies for older patients, it is important to 
      identify how stroke care is currently provided for this patient group. METHODS: 
      Between 2004 and 2006, older patients (>75 years) referred to a neurovascular 
      clinic were compared with younger patients (< or =75 years). Sociodemographic 
      details, clinical features, resource use and secondary prevention in a 
      neurovascular clinic were collected. RESULTS: Of 379 patients referred to the 
      clinic, 129 (34%) were given a non-stroke diagnosis. Of the remaining 250 
      patients, 149 (60%) were < or =75 years. Median time from symptom onset to clinic 
      appointment was similar for the two groups (24 (IQR 15-42) vs 24 (IQR 14-43) 
      days; p = 0.58). Older patients were more likely to be in atrial fibrillation 
      (10.1% vs 22.8%, p<0.001) and have lacunar stroke (34.7% vs 22.1%; p = 0.04). CT 
      rates were similar in the two groups (27.8% vs 80.0%, p = 0.75). Scans were 
      performed more quickly in younger patients (p<0.01). MRI scan rates were higher 
      in younger patients (26% vs 4%, p<0.01), as was carotid Doppler imaging (92% vs 
      77%, p<0.01). There were no differences in prescribed secondary preventive 
      treatments. Older patients experienced less delay for carotid endarterectomy (49 
      vs 90 days, p<0.01). Younger patients were more likely to be given advice on 
      weight reduction (30.2% vs 12.9%, p<0.01) and diet (46.3% vs 31.7%, p = 0.02) 
      than older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients were less likely to receive 
      diagnostic investigations and lifestyle modification advice than younger 
      patients. Guidelines need to be adopted to ensure prompt evidence-based stroke 
      care in the outpatient setting.
