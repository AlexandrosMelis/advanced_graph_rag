AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare growth curves of body mass index from children to 
      adolescents, and then to young adults, in Japanese girls and women in birth 
      cohorts born from 1930 to 1999. DESIGN: Retrospective repeated cross sectional 
      annual nationwide surveys (national nutrition survey, Japan) carried out from 
      1948 to 2005. SETTING: Japan. PARTICIPANTS: 76,635 females from 1 to 25 years of 
      age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Body mass index. RESULTS: Generally, body mass index 
      decreased in preschool children (2-5 years), increased in children (6-12 years) 
      and adolescents (13-18 years), and slightly decreased in young adults (19-25 
      years) in these Japanese females. However, the curves differed among birth 
      cohorts. More recent cohorts were more overweight as children but thinner as 
      young women. The increments in body mass index in early childhood were larger in 
      more recent cohorts than in older cohorts. However, the increments in body mass 
      index in adolescents were smaller and the decrease in body mass index in young 
      adults started earlier, with lower peak values in more recent cohorts than in 
      older cohorts. The decrements in body mass index in young adults were similar in 
      all birth cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: An overweight birth cohort in childhood does not 
      necessarily continue to be overweight in young adulthood. Not only secular trends 
      in body mass index at fixed ages but also growth curves for wide age ranges by 
      birth cohorts should be considered to study obesity and thinness. Growth curves 
      by birth cohorts were produced by a repeated cross sectional annual survey over 
      nearly six decades.
