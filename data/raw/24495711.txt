AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 50,000 new HIV infections occur annually in the United 
      States. Injection drug users represent twelve percent of incident HIV infections 
      each year. Pharmacy sales of over-the-counter (OTC) syringes have helped prevent 
      HIV transmission among injection drug users in many states throughout the United 
      States. However, concerns exist among some law enforcement officials, 
      policymakers, pharmacists, and community members about potential links between 
      OTC syringe sales and crime. METHODS: We used a geographic information system and 
      novel spatial and longitudinal analyses to determine whether implementation of 
      pharmacy-based OTC syringe sales were associated with reported crime between 
      January 2006 and December 2008 in Los Angeles Police Department Reporting 
      Districts. We assessed reported crime pre- and post-OTC syringe sales initiation 
      as well as longitudinal associations between crime and OTC syringe-selling 
      pharmacies. RESULTS: By December 2008, 9.3% (94/1010) of Los Angeles Police 
      Department Reporting Districts had at least one OTC syringe-selling pharmacy. 
      Overall reported crime counts and reported crime rates decreased between 2006 and 
      2008 in all 1010 Reporting Districts. Using generalized estimating equations and 
      adjusting for potential confounders, reported crime rates were negatively 
      associated with OTC syringe sales (adjusted rate ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence 
      interval: 0.81, 0.99). CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that OTC pharmacy 
      syringe sales were not associated with increases in reported crime in local 
      communities in Los Angeles during 2006-2008.
