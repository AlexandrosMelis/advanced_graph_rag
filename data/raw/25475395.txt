AB  - INTRODUCTION: For women, the correlation between circulating androgens and sexual 
      desire is inconclusive. Substitution with androgens at physiological levels 
      improves sexual function in women who experience decreased sexual desire and 
      androgen deficiency from surgical menopause, pituitary disease, and age-related 
      decline in androgen production in the ovaries. Measuring bioactive testosterone 
      is difficult and new methods have been proposed, including measuring the primary 
      androgen metabolite androsterone glucuronide (ADT-G). AIM: The aim of this study 
      was to investigate a possible correlation between serum levels of androgens and 
      sexual desire in women and whether the level of ADT-G is better correlated than 
      the level of circulating androgens with sexual desire. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study including 560 healthy women aged 19-65 years divided into 
      three age groups. Correlations were considered to be statistically significant at 
      P<0.05. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Sexual desire was determined as the total score of 
      the sexual desire domain of the Female Sexual Function Index. Total testosterone 
      (TT), calculated free testosterone (FT), androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone 
      sulfate (DHEAS), and ADT-G were analyzed using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Sexual 
      desire correlated overall with FT and androstenedione in the total cohort of 
      women. In a subgroup of women aged 25-44 years with no use of systemic hormonal 
      contraception, sexual desire correlated with TT, FT, androstenedione, and DHEAS. 
      In women aged 45-65 years, androstenedione correlated with sexual desire. No 
      correlations between ADT-G and sexual desire were identified. CONCLUSIONS: In the 
      present study, FT and androstenedione were statistically significantly correlated 
      with sexual desire in the total cohort of women. ADT-G did not correlate more 
      strongly than circulating androgens with sexual desire and is therefore not 
      superior to measuring circulating androgens by mass spectrometry.
