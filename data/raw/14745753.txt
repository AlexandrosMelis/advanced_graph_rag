TI  - Is half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography sufficient for 
      the abdominal aorta and pelvis?
PG  - 194-201
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the usefulness of half-dose contrast-enhanced magnetic 
      resonance (MR) angiography for depicting the abdominal aorta and its major 
      branches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 72 consecutive patients were randomly 
      assigned to one of four groups that underwent MR angiography after receiving 
      different concentrations (original or diluted to 50%) and total amounts (single 
      or half-dose) of gadolinium chelate injected at different rates (1 or 0.5 
      mL/second). The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of 
      the abdominal aorta and of the common and external iliac arteries were 
      calculated, and two blinded readers rated the respective image qualities. 
      RESULTS: The SNR and CNR of the abdominal aorta and the common iliac artery in 
      the 0.5 mL/second groups were statistically significantly lower than those in the 
      1 mL/second groups. The differences in overall image quality across the four 
      groups were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Half-dose MR angiography 
      using diluted contrast medium injected at a rate of 1 mL/second depicted the 
      abdominal aorta and its branches as clearly as using a full single dose.
