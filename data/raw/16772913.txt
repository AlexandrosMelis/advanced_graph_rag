TI  - A comparison of 500 prefilled textured saline breast implants versus 500 standard 
      textured saline breast implants: is there a difference in deflation rates?
PG  - 2175-8; discussion 2179-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study provides the first large-volume (1000 implant) comparison 
      of the deflation rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline 
      breast implants versus a control group of Mentor Siltex textured saline implants. 
      METHODS: A consecutive series of 500 Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured 
      saline breast implants was compared with a consecutive series of 500 Mentor 
      Siltex breast implants. Each breast implant was evaluated for a 4-year period, 
      and the annual deflation rate (number of deflations during a given year divided 
      by the total number of implants) and cumulative deflation rate (cumulative total 
      of deflations through a given year divided by the total number of implants) were 
      recorded. Statistical significance was calculated using the Fisher's exact test 
      at year 1 and the chi-square analysis at years 2 through 4. RESULTS: The 
      cumulative deflation rates of the Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was as 
      follows: year 1, 1.2 percent; year 2, 5.6 percent; year 3, 11.4 percent; and year 
      4, 15.4 percent. The cumulative deflation rates of the Mentor implants was: year 
      1, 0.2 percent; year 2, 0.6 percent; year 3, 1.6 percent; and year 4, 4.4 
      percent. At year 1, the difference between deflation rates was not statistically 
      significant (Fisher's exact test, p > 0.05). However, at year 2 (chi-square, 
      13.29; p < 0.001), year 3 (chi-square, 37.91; p < 0.001), and year 4 (chi-square, 
      32.69; p < 0.001), the difference was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was a statistically significant difference between the overall deflation 
      rates of Poly Implant Prosthesis prefilled textured saline breast implants and 
      Mentor Siltex breast implants at year 2, year 3, and year 4. After 4 years, the 
      15.56 percent cumulative deflation rate of Poly Implant Prosthesis implants was 
      over 3.5 times higher than the 4.31 percent deflation rate of the Mentor Siltex 
      implants. There may be several factors contributing to the higher deflation rate 
      seen in Poly Implant Prosthesis implants, including possible in vitro deflation 
      before implantation and silicone shell curing technique. Nevertheless, this 
      statistically significant deflation difference must be taken into account when 
      balancing the risks and benefits of Poly Implant Prosthesis breast implants.
