AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mediastinal lymph node dissection is an essential component of lung 
      cancer surgery; however, choosing mediastinal lymph nodes stations to be 
      dissected is subjective. We carried out this research to investigate the need for 
      dissection of station 9 lymph nodes during lung cancer surgery. METHODS: Patients 
      with primary lung cancer who underwent radical surgery between 2010 and 2014 were 
      retrospectively reviewed. Clinical, pathologic, and prognosis data were obtained 
      and analyzed. RESULTS: A total number of 1397 patients were included in this 
      research. The metastasis rate of station 9 was 3.45%, which was significantly 
      lower than other mediastinal stations. This metastasis rate was significantly 
      correlated with pT stage, the lobe where the tumor was located, metastasis status 
      of intrapulmonary lymph nodes, pTNM stage, and most of the other mediastinal 
      lymph node stations. In males or ground glass opacity (GGO) patients, the 
      metastasis of station 9 nodes was more unlikely to occur, even though there was 
      no statistical significance. The staging results of most patients (99.63%) would 
      not be impaired, even if station 9 nodes were not dissected, and the prognostic 
      analysis showed that the metastasis status of station 9 had no significant 
      influence on survival. CONCLUSION: The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes 
      was significantly lower than other mediastinal stations in lung cancer patients. 
      The metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on tumor staging 
      or prognosis. Routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary, 
      especially in patients with a low T stage, upper or middle lobe tumors, or 
      without intrapulmonary lymph node metastasis.
