TI  - Could ESC (Electronic Stability Control) change the way we drive?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: ESC (Electronic Stability Control) is a crash avoidance technology 
      that reduces the likelihood of collisions involving loss of control. Although 
      past and emerging research indicates that ESC is effective in reducing collision 
      rates and saving lives, and its inclusion in all vehicle platforms is encouraged, 
      drivers may demonstrate behavioral adaptation or an overreliance on ESC that 
      could offset or reduce its overall effectiveness. The main objective of the 
      present study was to determine whether behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely to 
      occur upon the widespread introduction of ESC into the Canadian vehicle fleet. 
      Secondary objectives were to confirm the results of a previous ESC public survey 
      and to generate a baseline measure for the future assessment of planned and 
      ongoing ESC promotional activities in Canada. METHODS: Two separate telephone 
      surveys evaluated drivers' perceptions and awareness of ESC. The first surveyed 
      500 randomly selected owners/drivers of passenger vehicles. The second surveyed 
      1017 owners/drivers of 2006-2008 ESC-equipped passenger vehicles from the 
      provinces of Quebec and British Columbia, Canada. RESULTS: Though ESC drivers 
      were much more likely than drivers of other vehicles to be aware of ESC (77% vs. 
      39%) and that their own vehicle was equipped with it (63% vs. 8%), 23 percent had 
      never heard of it. Ninety percent of drivers who knew that their vehicle was 
      equipped with ESC believed that ESC had made it safer to drive and reported being 
      confident that ESC would work in an emergency. Twenty-three percent of ESC owners 
      who knew their vehicle had ESC reported noticing long-lasting changes in their 
      driving behavior since they began driving the vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, 
      results suggest that behavioral adaptation to ESC is likely in certain drivers; 
      however, its proven effectiveness in reducing the likelihood of being involved in 
      a serious crash probably outweighs any potential increases in unsafe driving. To 
      fully benefit from ESC, vehicle manufacturers are encouraged to market 
      ESC-equipped vehicles in a realistic, safe manner. Driver training and safety 
      organizations are also encouraged to provide balanced educational information 
      about ESC to their members.
