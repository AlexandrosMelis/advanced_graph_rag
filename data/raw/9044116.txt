TI  - Biliary atresia: should all patients undergo a portoenterostomy?
PG  - 168-72; discussion 172-4
AB  - PURPOSE: The management of noncorrectable extra hepatic biliary atresia includes 
      portoenterostomy, although the results of the surgery are variable. This study 
      was done to develop criteria that could successfully predict the outcome of 
      surgery based on preoperative data, including percutaneous liver biopsy, allowing 
      a more selective approach to the care of these babies. METHODS: The charts and 
      biopsy results of 31 patients who underwent a Kasai procedure for biliary atresia 
      between 1984 and 1994 were reviewed. Values for preoperative albumin, bilirubin, 
      age of patient at Kasai, and lowest postoperative bilirubin were recorded. 
      Surgical success was defined as postoperative bilirubin that returned to normal. 
      A pathologist blinded to the child's eventual outcome graded the pre-Kasai needle 
      liver biopsy results according to duct proliferation, ductal plate lesion, bile 
      in ducts, lobular inflammation, giant cells, syncitial giant cells, focal 
      necrosis, bridging necrosis, hepatocyte ballooning, bile in zone 1, 2, and 3, 
      cholangitis, and end-stage cirrhosis. Clinical outcome was then predicted. 
      RESULTS: Success after portoenterostomy could not reliably be predicted based on 
      gender, age at Kasai, preoperative bilirubin or albumin levels. Histological 
      criteria, however, predicted outcome in 27 of 31 patients (P < .01). Fifteen of 
      17 clinical successes were correctly predicted; as were 12 of 14 clinical 
      failures (sensitivity, 86%; specificity, 88%). Individually, the presence of 
      syncitial giant cells, lobular inflammation, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, 
      and cholangitis, were each associated with failure of the portoenterostomy (P < 
      .05). Bile in zone 1 was associated with clinical success of the procedure (P < 
      .05). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the predictive information available in a liver 
      biopsy, we conclude that those patients who will not benefit from a Kasai 
      procedure can be identified preoperatively, and channeled immediately to 
      transplantation.
