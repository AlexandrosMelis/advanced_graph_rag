TI  - Continuity of care experience of residents in an academic vascular department: 
      are trainees learning complete surgical care?
PG  - 999-1003
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is widely accepted that exemplary surgical care involves a 
      surgeon's involvement in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative 
      periods. In an era of ever-expanding therapeutic modalities available to the 
      vascular surgeon, it is important that trainees gain experience in preoperative 
      decision-making and how this affects a patient's operative and postoperative 
      course. The purpose of this study was to define the current experience of 
      residents on a vascular surgery service regarding the continuity of care they are 
      able to provide for patients and the factors affecting this experience. METHODS: 
      This prospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and 
      conducted at the University of British Columbia during January 2005. All patients 
      who underwent a vascular procedure at either of the two teaching hospitals were 
      included. In addition to type of case (emergent, outpatient, inpatient), resident 
      demographic data and involvement in each patient's care (preoperative assessment, 
      postoperative daily assessment, and follow-up clinic assessment) were recorded. 
      Categoric data were analyzed with the chi2 test. RESULTS: The study included 159 
      cases, of which 65% were elective same-day admission patients, 20% were elective 
      previously admitted patients; and 15% were emergent. The overall rate of 
      preoperative assessment was 67%, involvement in the decision to operate, 17%; 
      postoperative assessment on the ward, 79%; and patient follow-up in clinic, 3%. 
      The rate of complete in-hospital continuity of care (assessing patient pre-op and 
      post-op) was 57%. Emergent cases were associated with a significantly higher rate 
      of preoperative assessment (92% vs 63%, P < .05). For elective cases admitted 
      before the day of surgery compared with same-day admission patients, the rates of 
      preoperative assessment (78% vs 58%, P < .05) and involvement in the decision to 
      operate (16% vs 4%, P < .05) were significantly higher. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      continuity-of-care experiences of vascular trainees are suboptimal. This is 
      especially true for postoperative clinic assessment. Same-day admission surgery 
      accounted for most of the cases and was associated with the poorest continuity of 
      care. To provide complete surgical training in an era of changing therapeutic 
      modalities and same-day admission surgery, vascular programs must be creative in 
      structuring training to include adequate ambulatory experience.
