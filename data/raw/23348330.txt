AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of closed reduction and the 
      effects of timing and fracture types on patient satisfaction. METHODS: Only 
      patients with isolated nasal fractures were included in the study. Patients with 
      additional maxillofacial fractures and patients whose application time to our 
      clinic was more than 10 days after the trauma were excluded. Patients were 
      classified into 5 types according to their fracture. All patients underwent 
      closed reduction and external fixation under local anesthesia. Patients were 
      asked about their satisfaction in a survey at 28th day and sixth month after the 
      surgery. Patients were divided into groups according to fracture type and 
      intervention time, and the results of the survey were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 
      43 patients included in the study, 38 were male, 5 were female, and the average 
      age was 24.9. The average intervention time of the patients was 5.44 days. 
      Twenty-eight (65%) of 43 patients were satisfied with the result, whereas 15 
      (35%) patients were not happy with their operation. In a comparison of patient 
      satisfaction rates according to fracture type, the mild fracture group had a 
      higher satisfaction rate compared to the severe fracture group. CONCLUSION: 
      Closed reduction is an easy and sufficient treatment for nasal fractures, 
      especially for mild nasal fractures. Early intervention raises the patient 
      satisfaction rate.
