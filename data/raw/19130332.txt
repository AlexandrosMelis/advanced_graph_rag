TI  - Is the zeolite hemostatic agent beneficial in reducing blood loss during arterial 
      injury?
PG  - 7-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncontrolled hemorrhage is the leading cause of fatality. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the effect of zeolite mineral (QuikClot - Advanced 
      Clotting Sponge [QC-ACS]) on blood loss and physiological variables in a swine 
      extremity arterial injury model. METHODS: Sixteen swine were used. Oblique groin 
      incision was created and a 5 mm incision was made. The animals were allocated to: 
      control group (n: 6): Pressure dressing was applied with manual pressure over 
      gauze sponge; or QC group (n: 10): QC was directly applied over lacerated femoral 
      artery. Mean arterial pressure, blood loss and physiological parameters were 
      measured during the study period. RESULTS: Application of QC led to a slower drop 
      in blood pressure. The control group had a significantly higher increase in 
      lactate within 60 minutes. The mean prothrombin time in the control group was 
      significantly increased at 60 minutes. The application of QC led to decreased 
      total blood loss. The QC group had significantly higher hematocrit levels. QC 
      application generated a significant heat production. There were mild edematous 
      and vacuolar changes in nerve samples. CONCLUSION: According to the physiological 
      parameters, we observed that zeolite tends to reduce blood loss, however could 
      not stop bleeding completely. We believe that further clinical trials are needed 
      to conclude that zeolite could be used in the routine practice.
