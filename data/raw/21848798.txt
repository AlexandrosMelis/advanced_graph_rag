      rate?

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent clinical trials (RCT) of bowel preparation, Golytely was 
      more efficacious than MiraLAX. We hypothesised that there is a difference in 
      adenoma detection between Golytely and MiraLAX. AIMS: To compare the adenoma 
      detection rate (ADR) between these bowel preparations, and to identify 
      independent predictors of bowel preparation quality and adenoma detection. 
      METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of an RCT that assessed efficacy and 
      patient tolerability of Golytely vs. MiraLAX/Gatorade in average risk screening 
      colonoscopy patients. Bowel preparation quality was measured with the Boston 
      Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). An excellent/good equivalent BBPS score was 
      defined as >/= 7. Polyp pathology review was performed. ADR was defined as the 
      proportion of colonoscopies with an adenoma. Univariate and multivariate analyses 
      were conducted. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety patients were prospectively 
      enrolled (87 MiraLAX, 103 Golytely). Golytely had a higher rate of a BBPS score >/= 
      7 (82.5% vs. MiraLAX 67.8%, P=0.02). The ADR in the Golytely cohort was 26.2% 
      (27/103), and was 16.1% (14/87) for MiraLAX (P = 0.091). On multivariate 
      analyses, Golytely was 2.13 x more likely to be associated with a BBPS >/= 7 (95% 
      CI 1.05-4.32, P = 0.04) and 2.28 x more likely to be associated with adenoma 
      detection (95% CI 1.05-4.98, P = 0.04) than MiraLAX. CONCLUSIONS: Golytely was 
      more efficacious than MiraLAX in bowel cleansing, and was independently 
      associated with both bowel prep quality (BBPS >/= 7) and higher adenoma detection. 
      Golytely should be used as first line for bowel prep for colonoscopy. Studies 
      with larger populations are needed to confirm these results.
