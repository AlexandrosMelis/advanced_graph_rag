      extrapulmonary small cell cancers?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (EPSCC) are rare 
      tumors where therapy remains poorly defined. We sought to determine the impact of 
      surgical extirpation and radiation therapy for outcomes of EPSCC. METHODS: The 
      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for 
      patients with EPSCC which were further categorized by site and evaluated for 
      survival by specific treatment strategy. RESULTS: We identified 94,173 patients 
      with small cell carcinoma of which 88,605 (94.1%) and 5,568 (5.9%) had pulmonary 
      small cell carcinoma and EPSCC, respectively. EPSCC patients were subdivided by 
      site with the following proportions: genitourinary (24.1%), gastrointestinal 
      (22.1%), head and neck (7.1%), breast (4%), and miscellaneous (42.7%). Overall 
      EPSSC and specifically gastrointestinal disease had significantly improved 
      median, 5- and 10-year survival with surgery and/or radiation for all stages and 
      sizes. For all EPSCCs multivariate analysis revealed age (>50), gender (female), 
      stage (regional, distant), radiation, and surgery to be independent predictors of 
      survival. CONCLUSIONS: Although outcomes for EPSCC remains poor, both surgery and 
      radiation is shown to significantly improve median, 5- and 10-year survival 
      rates. EPSCC patients who are potential candidates for surgical resection or 
      radiation therapy may benefit from these treatments.
