TI  - Is muscle power related to running speed with changes of direction?
PG  - 282-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to identify the relationships between 
      leg muscle power and sprinting speed with changes of direction. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: the study was designed to describe relationships between physical 
      qualities and a component of sports performance. SETTING: testing was conducted 
      in an indoor sports hall and a biomechanics laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 15 male 
      participants were required to be free of injury and have recent experience 
      competing in sports involving sprints with changes of direction. MEASURES: 
      subjects were timed in 8 m sprints in a straight line and with various changes of 
      direction. They were also tested for bilateral and unilateral leg extensor muscle 
      concentric power output by an isokinetic squat and reactive strength by a drop 
      jump. RESULTS: The correlations between concentric power and straight sprinting 
      speed were non-significant whereas the relationships between reactive strength 
      and straight speed were statistically significant. Correlations between muscle 
      power and speed while changing direction were generally low and non-significant 
      for concentric leg power with some moderate and significant (p<0.05) coefficients 
      found for reactive strength. The participants who turned faster to one side 
      tended to have a reactive strength dominance in the leg responsible for the 
      push-off action. CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between leg muscle power and 
      change-of-direction speed were not consistent. Reactive strength as measured by 
      the drop jump appears to have some importance for lateral change-of-direction 
      speed, possibly because of similar push-off actions. It was concluded that 
      reactive strength of the leg extensor muscles has some importance in 
      change-of-direction performance but the other technical and perceptual factors 
      than influence agility performance should also be considered.
