TI  - Does hippocampal atrophy on MRI predict cognitive decline? A prospective 
      follow-up study.
PG  - 1182-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the presence of hippocampal atrophy (HCA) on 
      MRI in Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to a more rapid decline in cognitive 
      function. To investigate whether cognitively unimpaired controls and depressed 
      subjects with HCA are at higher risk than those without HCA of developing 
      dementia. DESIGN: A prospective follow-up of subjects from a previously reported 
      MRI study. SETTING: Melbourne, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Five controls with HCA 
      and five age-matched controls without HCA, seven depressed subjects with HCA and 
      seven without HCA, and 12 subjects with clinically diagnosed probable AD with HCA 
      and 12 without HCA were studied. They were followed up at approximately 2 years 
      with repeat cognitive testing, blind to initial diagnosis and MRI result. 
      MEASURES: HCA was rated by two radiologists blind to cognitive test score 
      results. Cognitive assessment was by the Cambridge Cognitive Examination 
      (CAMCOG). RESULTS: No significant differences in rate of cognitive decline, 
      mortality or progression to dementia were found between subjects with or without 
      HCA. CONCLUSIONS: HCA was not found to be a predictor of subsequent cognitive 
      decline in this series.
