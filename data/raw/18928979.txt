AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether myometrial 
      electrical activity can differentiate false from true preterm labor. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Electrical uterine myography (EUM) was measured prospectively on 87 
      women, gestational age less than 35 weeks. The period between contractions, power 
      of contraction peaks and movement of center of electrical activity (RMS), was 
      used to develop an index score (1-5) for prediction of preterm delivery (PTD) 
      within 14 days of the test. The score was compared with fetal fibronectin (fFN) 
      and cervical length (CL). RESULTS: Patients delivering within 14 days from 
      testing showed a higher index and mean RMS (P = .000). No patients with EUM index 
      scores of 1-2 delivered in this time frame. Combining EUM with CL or fFN 
      increased predictability. Logistic regression revealed that history of PTD and 
      EUM index had 4- to 5-fold increased risk for PTD. Gestational age at testing, 
      body mass index, fFN, and CL were nonsignificant contributors to PTD risk. 
      CONCLUSION: Measuring myometrial electrical activity may enhance identification 
      of patients in true premature labor.
