AB  - BACKGROUND: The CLASS Act, which was part of the Affordable Care Act of 2010, 
      established a voluntary personal assistance services (PAS) insurance program. 
      However, concerns about enrollment and adverse selection led to repeal of the 
      CLASS Act in 2013. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the number of middle-aged adults 
      interested in purchasing PAS insurance, the sociodemographic, socioeconomic and 
      disability attributes of this population, and the maximum monthly premium they 
      would be willing to pay for such coverage. METHODS: A total of 13,384 adults aged 
      40-65 answered questions about their interest in PAS insurance in the 2011 Sample 
      Adult National Health Interview Survey. We applied survey weights for the U.S. 
      population and conducted logistic regression analyses to identify personal 
      factors associated with interest in paying for the CLASS program. RESULTS: An 
      estimated 25.8 million adults aged 40-65 (26.7%) said they would be interested in 
      paying for a public insurance program to cover PAS benefits. However, interest in 
      PAS insurance varied by age, race, ethnicity, region, income, disability status, 
      and family experience with ADL assistance. Only 1.6 million adults aged 40-65 
      (1.8%) said they would be willing to pay $100 per month or more for coverage. 
      CONCLUSIONS: While more than a quarter of the middle-aged adult population said 
      they were interested in PAS insurance, actual participation would be highly 
      dependent on premium rates. The current lack of publicly subsidized insurance for 
      long-term care and personal assistance services remains a serious gap in the 
      disability service system.
