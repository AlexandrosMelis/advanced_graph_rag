AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the potential 
      benefits of delayed phase imaging series in routine CT scans of the abdomen and 
      pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routine contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans 
      of 1000 consecutively examined patients (912 men, 88 women; average age, 60 
      years; range, 22-94 years) were retrospectively evaluated, and the added benefits 
      of the delayed phase series through the abdomen were recorded for each 
      examination. Examinations performed for indications requiring multiphasic imaging 
      were excluded. Images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained abdominal 
      radiologists, who were blinded to official CT reports. All examinations were 
      performed between July 2008 and February 2010 at a single institution. Radiation 
      doses for both the portal venous and delayed phases, when available, were 
      analyzed to assess the effect of the delayed phase on overall radiation exposure. 
      RESULTS: Forty-two patients (4.2%) had findings that were further characterized 
      or were observed only in the delayed phase. Most were incidental findings that 
      could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging, such as sonography or 
      unenhanced CT or MRI. The most common findings were liver hemangioma (n = 12), 
      adrenal adenoma (n = 12), and parapelvic renal cysts (n = 6). The most important 
      finding was detection of a renal mass in one patient (0.1%). The mass was seen 
      only on the delayed phase images but was difficult to appreciate in the portal 
      venous phase. In the other 958 patients (95.8%), delayed imaging was of no 
      benefit. In addition, use of the delayed phase resulted in a mean 59.5% increase 
      in effective radiation dose. CONCLUSION: An additional delayed phase through the 
      abdomen in routine contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is 
      of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate 
      uncertain findings is available.
