TI  - Do liquid-based preparations of urinary cytology perform differently than 
      classically prepared cases? Observations from the College of American 
      Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Nongynecologic Cytology.
PG  - 19-22
AB  - CONTEXT: The cytomorphology of liquid-based preparations in urine cytology is 
      different than classic slide preparations. OBJECTIVES: To compare the performance 
      of liquid-based preparation specimens to classically prepared urine specimens 
      with a malignant diagnosis in the College of American Pathologists 
      Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Nongynecologic Cytology. DESIGN: 
      Participant responses between 2000 and 2007 for urine specimens with a reference 
      diagnosis of high-grade urothelial carcinoma/carcinoma in situ/dysplasia (HGUCA), 
      squamous cell carcinoma, or adenocarcinoma were evaluated. ThinPrep and SurePath 
      challenges were compared with classic preparations (smears, cytospins) for 
      discordant responses. RESULTS: There were 18 288 pathologist, 11 957 
      cytotechnologist, and 8086 "laboratory" responses available. Classic preparations 
      comprised 90% (n = 34 551) of urine challenges; 9% (n = 3295) were ThinPrep and 
      1% (n = 485) were SurePath. Concordance to the general category of 
      "positive-malignant" was seen in 92% of classic preparations, 96.5% of ThinPrep, 
      and 94.6% of SurePath challenges (P < .001). These results were statistically 
      different for the exact reference interpretation of HGUCA (P < .001) but not for 
      adenocarcinoma (P = .22). Cytotechnologists demonstrate statistically better 
      performance for the general category of "positive-malignant" compared with 
      pathologists for all urinary slide types and for the exact reference 
      interpretation of HGUCA (94% versus 91.1%; P < .001) but not adenocarcinoma 
      (96.3% versus 95.8%; P = .77) or squamous cell carcinoma (93.6% versus 87.7%; P = 
      .07). CONCLUSIONS: Liquid-based preparations performed significantly better in 
      urinary cytology challenges when evaluating malignant categories in the College 
      of American Pathologists interlaboratory comparison program. The liquid-based 
      preparation challenges also performed better for the exact reference 
      interpretation of HGUCA, but no difference was observed for adenocarcinoma 
      challenges. Cytotechnologists perform better than pathologists for all slide 
      types, as well as those demonstrating HGUCA. These results suggest that 
      liquid-based preparations facilitate a more accurate diagnosis than conventional 
      preparations.
