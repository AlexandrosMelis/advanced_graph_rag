AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing concern amongst educators that the provision of 
      recorded lectures may reduce student attendance of live lectures. We therefore 
      sought to determine if the provision of prerecorded lecture video podcasts 
      (VODcasts) to first-year Graduate Entry to Medicine (GEM) students, affected 
      attendance at 21 Physiology lectures within three separate pre-clinical modules. 
      METHODS: Data on lecture attendance, utilization of VODcasts, and whether 
      VODcasts should replace live lectures were drawn from three surveys conducted in 
      academic years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 on all first-year GEM students in two 
      first-year pre-clinical modules where prerecorded Physiology VODcasts were 
      available for viewing or downloading prior to scheduled live lectures. RESULTS: A 
      total of 191/214 (89%) students responded to the three surveys, with 84.3% of 
      students attending all 21 lectures in the study. Only 4% of students missed more 
      than one lecture in each of the three lecture series, with 79% indicating that 
      VODcasts should not replace lectures. CONCLUSION: Therefore, we conclude that the 
      attendance of pre-clinical GEM students at live lectures is not significantly 
      impacted upon by the provision of lecture VODcasts, with most students viewing 
      them as useful revision tools rather than as a replacement for live lectures.
