TI  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict 
      outcome?
PG  - 54-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to delineate early respiratory predictors 
      of mortality in children with hemato-oncology malignancy who developed acute 
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a 
      retrospective chart review of children with malignant and ARDS who needed 
      mechanical ventilation and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from 
      January 1987 to January 1997. RESULTS: Seventeen children with ARDS and 
      malignancy aged 10.5 +/- 5.1 years were identified. Six of the 17 children 
      (35.3%) survived. Sepsis syndrome was present in 70.6% of all the children. Peak 
      inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation 
      index values could distinguish outcome by day 3. A significant relationship 
      between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation, as 
      determined by PaO(2)/FIO(2) and P(A-a)O(2), was present from day 8 after onset of 
      mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and 
      ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. 
      This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in 
      children with malignancy and ARDS.
