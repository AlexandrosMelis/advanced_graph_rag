TI  - Colorectal cancer in young patients: is it a distinct clinical entity?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of colorectal cancer in young patients is increasing. 
      It remains unclear if the disease has unique features in this age group. METHODS: 
      This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study which included patients 
      diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age </=40 years in 1997-2013 matched 1:2 by 
      year of diagnosis with consecutive colorectal cancer patients diagnosed at age 
      >50 years during the same period. Patients aged 41-50 years were not included in 
      the study, to accentuate potential age-related differences. Clinicopathological 
      characteristics, treatment, and outcome were compared between groups. RESULTS: 
      The cohort included 330 patients, followed for a median time of 65.9 months 
      (range 4.7-211). Several significant differences were noted. The younger group 
      had a different ethnic composition. They had higher rates of family history of 
      colorectal cancer (p = 0.003), hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes 
      (p < 0.0001), and inflammatory bowel disease (p = 0.007), and a lower rate of 
      polyps (p < 0.0001). They were more likely to present with stage III or IV 
      disease (p = 0.001), angiolymphatic invasion, signet cell ring adenocarcinoma, 
      and rectal tumors (p = 0.02). Younger patients more frequently received 
      treatment. Young patients had a worse estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate 
      (57.6  vs. 70 %, p = 0.039), but this did not retain significance when analyzed 
      by stage (p = 0.092). Estimated 5-year overall survival rates were 59.1 and 
      62.1 % in the younger and the control group, respectively (p = 0.565). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Colorectal cancer among young patients may constitute a distinct 
      clinical entity. Further research is needed to validate our findings and define 
      the optimal approach in this population.
