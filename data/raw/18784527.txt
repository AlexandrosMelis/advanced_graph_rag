AB  - PURPOSE: Multislice helical computed tomography (CT), which can provide detailed 
      2-D and 3-D reconstructed images, is useful in imaging diagnosis for dental 
      implant treatment. Therefore, in this study, it was performed to clarify the 
      mandibular depiction of double-oblique reconstructed images when changing their 
      thickness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 38 sites in the mandibular molar 
      region were examined using multislice helical CT. The thicknesses of the 
      double-oblique images using multislice helical CT scans were reconstructed in 4 
      conditions: 0.3 mm, 0.9 mm, 1.6 mm, and 4.1 mm. In double-oblique images, 
      mandibular depiction was evaluated by 5 oral radiologists using a subjective 
      rating score. RESULTS: In the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular 
      canal, the highest value was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images; however, there 
      was no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that depiction of the superior wall of the mandibular 
      canal cannot be improved by changing the thickness of images.
