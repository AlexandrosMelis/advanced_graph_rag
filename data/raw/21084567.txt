AB  - BACKGROUND: Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring is gaining increasing popularity 
      among patients and may be useful in hypertension management. Little is known 
      about the reliability of stroke patients' records of home BP monitoring. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability of home BP recording in hypertensive 
      patients who had suffered a recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack. METHODS: 
      Thirty-nine stroke patients (mean age 73 years) randomized to the intervention 
      arm of a trial of home BP monitoring were included. Following instruction by a 
      research nurse, patients recorded their BPs at home and documented them in a 
      booklet over the next year. The booklet readings over a month were compared with 
      the actual readings downloaded from the BP monitor and were checked for errors or 
      selective bias in recording. RESULTS: A total of 1027 monitor and 716 booklet 
      readings were recorded. Ninety per cent of booklet recordings were exactly the 
      same as the BP monitor readings. Average booklet readings were 0.6 mmHg systolic 
      [95% confidence interval (95% CI) -0.6 to 1.8] and 0.3 mmHg diastolic (95% CI 
      -0.3 to 0.8) lower than those on the monitor. CONCLUSIONS: This group of elderly 
      stroke patients were able to record their BPs reliably at home. Any bias was 
      small and would be unlikely to affect management. Since BP readings in a GP 
      surgery are often a poor indication of true BP, GPs might consider using 
      hypertensive patients' records of home BP monitoring to help guide treatment 
      decisions.
