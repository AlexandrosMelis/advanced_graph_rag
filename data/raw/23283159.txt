AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of obesity at the start of adolescence on the 
      prevalence, incidence and maintenance of chest wheezing among individuals aged 
      11-15 years in a birth cohort in a developing country. METHODS: The seventh 
      follow-up of the 1993 Pelotas birth cohort occurred in 2004 (individuals aged 
      10-11 years). Between January and August 2008, the eighth follow-up of the cohort 
      was conducted. All the individuals of the original cohort who were alive (who 
      were then adolescents aged between 14 and 15 years) were targets for the study. 
      The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) 
      questionnaire was used to define wheezing. In addition to the body mass index 
      (BMI), used to define obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, we 
      assessed skinfold thickness. RESULTS: From the original cohort, 4,349 individuals 
      were located (85.7% follow-up rate). The prevalence of chest wheezing at 11 and 
      15 years were 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.5%) and 12.1% (95% CI: 11.1%-13.1%), 
      respectively. The prevalence of wheezing at both times was 4.5% (95% CI: 
      3.9%-5.1%) and the incidence of wheezing was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). 
      Independent of the effect of various confounding variables, the prevalence of 
      wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic 
      individuals at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05). The greater the skinfold 
      tertile at 11 years, the higher the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was (p = 
      .011). Weight status and skinfolds did not present any association with incident 
      wheezing. After controlling for confounding factors, the risk of persistent 
      wheezing among obese individuals at 11 years was 1.82 (95% CI: 1.30-2.54). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Since obesity at the start of adolescence is associated with asthma 
      symptom persistence, prevention and treatment of obesity may reduce avoidable 
      healthcare costs and disease burden.
