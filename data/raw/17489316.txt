TI  - [Is tumour expression of VEGF associated with venous invasion and survival in pT3 
      renal cell carcinoma?].
PG  - 189-93
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a relationship between VEGF 
      expression and renal vein and vena cava invasion in stage pT3 renal cell 
      carcinoma and to evaluate the impact of VEGF expression on survival in pT3 renal 
      cell carcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 78 patients with a pT3a or pT3b tumour 
      without vena cava invasion or pT3b tumour with vena cava invasion were compared 
      for age, gender, Fuhrman grade and immunohistochemical expression of VEGF. All 
      these variables were submitted to univariate and multivariate analysis to 
      establish their impact on survival. RESULTS: Only tumour size appeared to be 
      significantly different between the 3 groups. On univariate analysis, invasion of 
      the perirenal fat, lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression 
      were significantly associated with survival (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, 
      lymph node involvement, distant metastases and VEGF expression (OR 6.07) were 
      identified as independent predictive factors of survival. CONCLUSION: Progression 
      of a pT3 tumour into the renal vein and vena cava is not associated with 
      increased tumour expression of VEGF. However, VEGF is an independent prognostic 
      factor in this group of poor prognosis renal tumours.
