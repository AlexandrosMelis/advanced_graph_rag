TI  - Body dysmorphic disorder: does it have a psychotic subtype?
PG  - 389-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is classified in DSM-III-R as 
      a nonpsychotic somatoform disorder, controversy exists as to whether BDD can 
      present with psychotic features. If it can, this raises the possibility that its 
      DSM-III-R psychotic counterpart-delusional disorder, somatic type--may not be a 
      separate disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients 
      with nonpsychotic BDD (defined according to DSM-III-R criteria, i.e., with 
      maintenance of some insight) were different from patients with psychotic BDD 
      (those whose preoccupation was without insight and of delusional intensity). 
      METHOD: Fifty consecutive patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria A and C for BDD 
      were assessed with a semistructured interview and the Structured Clinical 
      Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Family histories of psychiatric disorders were 
      blindly assessed. The 24 patients with nonpsychotic BDD were compared with the 26 
      patients with psychotic BDD with respect to demographics, phenomenology, course 
      of illness, associated features, comorbid psychiatric disorders, family history, 
      and treatment response. RESULTS: Patients with psychotic BDD displayed a 
      significantly higher rate of lifetime DSM-III-R psychotic disorder diagnoses than 
      patients with nonpsychotic BDD. However, the two groups did not differ 
      significantly on most other variables examined. For instance, both psychotic and 
      nonpsychotic patients displayed significant morbidity; high comorbidity with 
      mood, anxiety, and psychoactive substance use disorders; and apparent 
      preferential response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than to 
      non-serotonin reuptake blocking antidepressants or antipsychotics. CONCLUSION: 
      Body dysmorphic disorder may have a closely related psychotic subtype that 
      significantly overlaps with, or may even be the same disorder as, the BDD variant 
      of delusional disorder, somatic type. Inclusion of a psychotic subtype for BDD 
      should be considered for future editions of DSM.
