TI  - Cue-induced behavioural activation: a novel model of alcohol craving?
PG  - 307-13
AB  - RATIONALE: Alcohol-associated cues elicit craving in human addicts but little is 
      known about craving mechanisms. Current animal models focus on relapse and this 
      may confound the effect of environmental cues. OBJECTIVES. To develop a model to 
      study the effects of environmental cues on alcohol consumption in animals not 
      experiencing withdrawal or relapse. METHODS: Rats were trained to orally 
      self-administer an alcohol (5% w/v)/saccharin (0.2%) solution 30 min a day for 20 
      days. After stable responding on a free choice between alcohol/saccharin and 
      water, rats were exposed to 5, 10 or 15 min of alcohol-associated cues or 5 min 
      of non-alcohol associated cues. The effect of a 5-min cue was measured after a 
      10-day break from training or pre-treatment with 0.03, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg naltrexone. 
      RESULTS: Rats given 5 min of alcohol-associated cues responded significantly more 
      on the active lever (26% increase) and consumed more alcohol as verified by 
      increased blood alcohol levels (8.9 mM versus control 7.5 mM). Ten or 15 min of 
      cues did not change alcohol consumption and 5 min in a novel environment 
      decreased response by 66%. After a 10-day break in training, 5 min of 
      alcohol-associated cues still increased alcohol consumption (29% increase) and 
      the cue effect could be dose-dependently blocked by naltrexone (143% decrease at 
      0.03 mg/kg). CONCLUSIONS: Cue-induced behavioural activation was specific to 
      alcohol cues, reproducible, persistent and could be blocked by naltrexone, and 
      its correlation with human self-report of craving makes it a potentially useful 
      model for studying alcohol craving.
