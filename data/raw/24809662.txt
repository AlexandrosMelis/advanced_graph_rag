      overactive bladder component of mixed incontinence?

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Midurethral sling (MUS) can improve overactive 
      bladder (OAB) symptoms. It is unclear if anterior/apical prolapse (AA) repair 
      provides additional benefit. We hypothesized that women with mixed urinary 
      incontinence (MUI) experience greater improvement in the OAB component of their 
      symptoms after concomitant MUS and AA repair compared with MUS alone. METHODS: 
      This is a retrospective cohort study of women with bothersome MUI (defined by 
      objective stress test and validated questionnaire) undergoing MUS alone 
      ("MUS-only") or concomitant MUS and AA repair ("MUS + AA"). Our primary outcome 
      was the Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Symptom Severity (OAB-q SS) change score 
      6 weeks after surgery. RESULTS: Of 151 women, 67 (44 %) underwent MUS-only and 84 
      (56 %) underwent MUS + AA. The MUS-only cohort was younger and had less severe 
      baseline prolapse (p < 0.05 for both). Postoperative complications (predominantly 
      UTI) occurred in 35 (23 %) patients and were similar between cohorts. For all 
      subjects mean OAB-q SS scores significantly improved postoperatively (p < 0.05). 
      Our primary outcome, OAB-q SS change score, showed no significant differences 
      between cohorts (30 +/- 26 MUS-only vs 25 +/- 25 MUS + AA, p = 0.20), indicating 
      similar improvements in OAB symptoms. Multivariate linear regression analysis 
      revealed no difference in OAB-q SS change score between cohorts; however, OAB-q 
      SS change scores were lower for women with a postoperative complication (beta = -19, 
      95 % CI -31 to -6; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In women with bothersome MUI, 
      concomitant AA repair does not result in additional improvement in OAB symptoms 
      over MUS alone. Patients with postoperative complications exhibit less 
      improvement in OAB symptoms.
