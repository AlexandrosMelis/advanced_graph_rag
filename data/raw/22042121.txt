AB  - PURPOSE: Demonstrate that the rabbit may be used in the training of surgery, in 
      addition to present its perioperative care. METHODS: Thirty two animals, with age 
      and weight, respectively, from 3 to 5.5 months old and 3000 to 4200 grams, were 
      undergone different periods of pre-operative fasting, exclusive intramuscular 
      anesthesia (ketamine+xylazine), laparotomy with total gastrectomy and total 
      splenectomy. It was dosed the pre-operative (initial) and post-surgical (end) 
      serum blood glucose, in addition to quantify the gastric content after the 
      resection of the part. RESULTS: The anesthetical-surgical procedure presented a 
      mortality rate of 3.125% (1:32) and a morbidity rate of 6.25% (2:32). It was 
      evidenced an initial mean blood glucose = 199.4 mg/dl and the end = 326.1 mg/dl. 
      In spite of extended fasting (minimum of 2 hours for the absolute fasting and 
      maximum of 8.5 hours for liquids, and 20.5 hours for solids) all animals 
      presented at the end of the surgical procedure any gastric content and a blood 
      glucose increase. Those with fasting for liquids and solids when compared to the 
      quantity of solid gastric content, presented a moderate negative degree of 
      correlation. CONCLUSION: The rabbit is a good model to be used in training of 
      surgery, with a low morbi-mortality, able to be anesthetized intramuscularly, 
      with no need of pre-operative fasting and does not present hypoglycemia even with 
      the extended fasting period.
