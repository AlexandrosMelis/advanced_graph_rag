TI  - Are there mental health differences between francophone and non-francophone 
      populations in manitoba?
PG  - 366-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Francophones may experience poorer health due to social status, 
      cultural differences in lifestyle and attitudes, and language barriers to health 
      care. Our study sought to compare mental health indicators between Francophones 
      and non-Francophones living in the province of Manitoba. METHODS: Two populations 
      were used: one from administrative datasets housed at the Manitoba Centre for 
      Health Policy and the other from representative survey samples. The 
      administrative datasets contained data from physician billings, hospitalizations, 
      prescription drug use, education, and social services use, and surveys included 
      indicators on language variables and on self-rated health. RESULTS: Outside urban 
      areas, Francophones had lower rates of diagnosed substance use disorder (rate 
      ratio [RR] = 0.80; 95% CI 0.68 to 0.95) and of suicide and suicide attempts (RR = 
      0.59; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.79), compared with non-Francophones, but no differences 
      were found between the groups across the province in rates of diagnosed mood 
      disorders, anxiety disorders, dementia, or any mental disorders after adjusting 
      for age, sex, and geographic area. When surveyed, Francophones were less likely 
      than non-Francophones to report that their mental health was excellent, very 
      good, or good (66.9%, compared with 74.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The discrepancy in how 
      Francophones view their mental health and their rates of diagnosed mental 
      disorders may be related to health seeking behaviours in the Francophone 
      population. Community and government agencies should try to improve the mental 
      health of this population through mental health promotion and by addressing 
      language and cultural barriers to health services.
