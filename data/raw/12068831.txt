TI  - Do nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles exist? A histologic and flow cytometric 
      reevaluation of nontriploid specimens.
PG  - 363-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles truly exist. 
      STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a reevaluation of pathology and ploidy in 19 putative 
      nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles using standardized histologic diagnostic 
      criteria and repeat flow cytometric testing by the Hedley technique. RESULTS: On 
      review of the 19 moles, 53% (10/19) were diploid nonpartial moles (initially 
      pathologically misclassified), and 37% (7/19) were triploid partial moles 
      (initial ploidy misclassifications). One additional case (5%) was a diploid early 
      complete mole (initially pathologically misclassified). CONCLUSION: Nontriploid 
      partial moles probably do not exist: careful reevaluation of putative specimens 
      will probably uncover pathologic or ploid errors in almost all cases.
