      concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement 
      therapy?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the interstitial fluid (ISF) and plasma pharmacokinetics 
      of meropenem in patients on continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational pharmacokinetic study. 
      Meropenem (500 mg) was administered every 8 h. CVVHDF was targeted as a 2-3 L/h 
      exchange using a polyacrylonitrile filter with a surface area of 1.05 m2 and a 
      blood flow rate of 200 mL/min. Serial blood (pre- and post-filter), 
      filtrate/dialysate and ISF concentrations were measured on 2 days of treatment 
      (Profiles A and B). Subcutaneous tissue ISF concentrations were determined using 
      microdialysis. RESULTS: A total of 384 samples were collected. During Profile A, 
      the comparative median (IQR) ISF and plasma peak concentrations were 13.6 
      (12.0-16.8) and 40.7 (36.6-45.6) mg/L and the trough concentrations were 2.6 
      (2.4-3.4) and 4.9 (3.5-5.0) mg/L, respectively. During Profile B, the ISF trough 
      concentrations increased by  approximately 40%. Meropenem ISF penetration was estimated at 63% 
      (60%-69%) and 69% (65%-74%) for Profiles A and B, respectively, using comparative 
      plasma and ISF AUCs. For Profile A, the plasma elimination t1/2 was 3.7 (3.3-4.0) 
      h, the volume of distribution was 0.35 (0.25-0.46) L/kg, the total clearance was 
      4.1 (4.1-4.8) L/h and the CVVHDF clearance was 2.9 (2.7-3.1) L/h. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This is the first known report of concurrent plasma and ISF concentrations of a 
      meropenem antibiotic during CVVHDF. We observed that the ISF concentrations of 
      meropenem were significantly lower than the plasma concentrations, although the 
      present dose was appropriate for infections caused by intermediately susceptible 
      pathogens (MIC</=4 mg/L).
