      laboratory markers useful?

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Specific markers for differentiation of nonalcoholic (NASH) from 
      alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) are lacking. We investigated the role of routine 
      laboratory parameters in distinguishing NASH from ASH. METHODS: Liver biopsies 
      performed at our hospital over a 10-year period were reviewed, 95 patients with 
      steatohepatitis identified and their data prior to biopsy reevaluated. The 
      diagnosis NASH or ASH was assigned (other liver diseases excluded) on the basis 
      of the biopsy and history of alcohol consumption (< 140 g/week). Logistic 
      regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS: NASH was diagnosed in 58 
      patients (61%; 30 f) and ASH in 37 (39%; 9 f). High-grade fibrosis (59% vs. 19%, 
      P < 0.0001) and an AST/ALT ratio > 1 (54.1% vs 20.7%, P = 0.0008) were more 
      common in ASH. The MCV was elevated in 53% of ASH patients and normal in all NASH 
      patients (P < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified the MCV (P = 0.0013), the 
      AST/ALT ratio (P = 0.011) and sex (P = 0.0029) as relevant regressors (aROC = 
      0.92). The AST/ALT ratio (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.00049) were independent 
      predictors of high-grade fibrosis. Differences in MCV were more marked in 
      high-grade fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Higher MCVs and AST/ALT ratios in ASH reflect 
      the severity of underlying liver disease and do not differentiate NASH from ASH. 
      Instead, these biomarkers might prove useful in guiding selection of patients for 
      liver biopsy and in targeting therapy.
