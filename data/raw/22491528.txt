      with colorectal cancer: are scores consistent with short-term outcome?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if composite measures based on process indicators are 
      consistent with short-term outcome indicators in surgical colorectal cancer care. 
      DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of consistency between composite measures based on 
      process indicators and outcome indicators for 85 Dutch hospitals. SETTING: The 
      Dutch Surgical Colorectal Audit database, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 4732 
      elective patients with colon carcinoma and 2239 with rectum carcinoma treated in 
      85 hospitals were included in the analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All available 
      process indicators were aggregated into five different composite measures. The 
      association of the different composite measures with risk-adjusted postoperative 
      mortality and morbidity was analysed at the patient and hospital level. RESULTS: 
      At the patient level, only one of the composite measures was negatively 
      associated with morbidity for rectum carcinoma. At the hospital level, a strong 
      negative association was found between composite measures and hospital mortality 
      and morbidity rates for rectum carcinoma (p<0.05), and hospital morbidity rates 
      for colon carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: For individual patients, a high score on the 
      composite measures based on process indicators is not associated with better 
      short-term outcome. However, at the hospital level, a good score on the composite 
      measures based on process indicators was consistent with more favourable 
      risk-adjusted short-term outcome rates.
