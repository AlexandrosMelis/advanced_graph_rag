TI  - Are high flow nasal cannulae noisier than bubble CPAP for preterm infants?
PG  - F291-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Noise exposure in the neonatal intensive care unit is believed to be 
      a risk factor for hearing loss in preterm neonates. Continuous positive airway 
      pressure (CPAP) devices exceed recommended noise levels. High flow nasal cannulae 
      (HFNC) are an increasingly popular alternative to CPAP for treating preterm 
      infants, but there are no in vivo studies assessing noise production by HFNC. 
      OBJECTIVE: To study whether HFNC are noisier than bubble CPAP (BCPAP) for preterm 
      infants. METHODS: An observational study of preterm infants receiving HFNC or 
      BCPAP. Noise levels within the external auditory meatus (EAM) were measured using 
      a microphone probe tube connected to a calibrated digital dosimeter. Noise was 
      measured across a range of frequencies and reported as decibels A-weighted (dBA). 
      RESULTS: A total of 21 HFNC and 13 BCPAP noise measurements were performed in 21 
      infants. HFNC gas flows were 2-5 L/min, and BCPAP gas flows were 6-10 L/min with 
      set pressures of 5-7 cm of water. There was no evidence of a difference in 
      average noise levels measured at the EAM: mean difference (95% CI) of -1.6 (-4.0 
      to 0.9) dBA for HFNC compared to BCPAP. At low frequency (500 Hz), HFNC was mean 
      (95% CI) 3.0 (0.3 to 5.7) dBA quieter than BCPAP. Noise increased with increasing 
      BCPAP gas flow (p=0.007), but not with increasing set pressure. There was a trend 
      to noise increasing with increasing HFNC gas flows. CONCLUSIONS: At the gas flows 
      studied, HFNC are not noisier than BCPAP for preterm infants.
