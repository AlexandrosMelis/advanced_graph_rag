AB  - BACKGROUND/GOALS: Clinical diagnosis of acute diverticulitis is currently 
      confirmed by an abdominal computerized tomography (CT). Common practice has been 
      to perform a colonoscopy after the event to exclude other diagnoses, mainly colon 
      cancer. Our aim was to evaluate the yield of an early colonoscopy. METHODS: 
      Medical records of 220 patients hospitalized for acute diverticulitis between 
      June 1, 2002 and September 1, 2009 were reviewed. Acute diverticulitis was 
      diagnosed by clinical criteria and characteristic CT findings. Fifteen patients 
      were excluded either because of questionable CT or hematochezia. Mean age was 
      61.8+/-14.3 years (61% females). Clinical parameters, laboratory results, imaging, 
      endoscopic and histopathological reports, and long-term patients' outcome were 
      analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred patients (aged 61.8+/-13.3 y, 54.1% females), 
      underwent an early (4 to 6 wk) colonoscopy after hospital discharge. There were 
      no significant differences in patients' characteristics or survival between those 
      with or without colonoscopy (4+/-1.9 vs. 4.2+/-2.1 y, P=0.62). No colonic malignancy 
      was detected. However, in 32 patients (32%) at least 1 polyp was found. Only 1 
      was determined as an advanced adenoma. No new or different diagnosis was made 
      after colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that colonoscopy does not 
      affect the management of patients with acute diverticulitis nor alter the 
      outcome. The current practice of a routine colonoscopy after acute 
      diverticulitis, diagnosed by typical clinical symptoms and CT needs to be 
      reevaluated.
