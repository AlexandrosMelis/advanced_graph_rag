AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbid major depression (MD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), 
      particularly in adolescents, have been shown to be associated with poorer 
      subsequent MD outcomes. METHODS: Longitudinal data were used to model 
      associations between a four-level classification of MD/AUD during the period 
      15-18 years (neither; MD-only; AUD-only; comorbid MD/AUD) and MD over the period 
      18-35 years. These associations were then adjusted for confounding by a series of 
      factors measured in childhood. RESULTS: The three disorder groups had rates of 
      adult MD during the period 18-35 years that were significantly (p<.05) higher 
      than that of the group with no disorder. Furthermore, those in the comorbid 
      MD/AUD group had significantly (p <.05) higher rates of adult MD than those in 
      the AUD-only group, and marginally (p <.10) higher rates of adult MD than those 
      in the MD-only group. After adjustment for confounding, the difference in rates 
      of adult MD between the MD-only group and the MD/AUD group were no longer 
      statistically significant. The factors that explained the associations were 
      gender, childhood behavior problems, and exposure to physical and sexual abuse. 
      LIMITATIONS: The data were obtained by self-report, and may have been subject to 
      biases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher 
      rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by 
      increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the 
      comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, 
      rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.
