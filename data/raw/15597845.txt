TI  - Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of 
      chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer? Preliminary in vitro 
      investigations.
PG  - 699-701
AB  - PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The endogenous estradiol metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol 
      (2ME), has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cell growth and a strong 
      anti-angiogenic substance. We investigated for the first time whether in vitro 
      combinations of 2ME with various chemotherapeutic compounds may result in an 
      additive inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human ovary cancer cells. 
      METHOD: As a model two different human ovary cancer cell lines were used. All 
      cell lines were incubated with equimolar concentrations of 2ME (0.8-25 microM) 
      and the chemotherapeutics epirubicine, doxorubicine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, 
      carboplatin, vinorelbine, 5-fluorouracil and mafosfamide. Proliferation was 
      measured after four days using the ATP-chemosensitivity test. RESULTS: For both 
      ovary cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of 2ME with epirubicine and 
      carboplatin was observed at the lower concentration range of these 
      chemotherapeutic substances. CONCLUSION: 2ME is able to enhance the 
      antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological 
      relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II 
      trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability 
      has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may 
      therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent 
      cancer.
