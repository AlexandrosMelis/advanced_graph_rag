TI  - Empiric treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection with fluoroquinolones 
      in older women in Israel: another lost treatment option?
PG  - 2223-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract 
      infection (UTI) in women recommend empiric therapy with antibiotics for which 
      local resistance rates do not exceed 10-20%. We hypothesized that resistance 
      rates of Escherichia coli to fluoroquinolones may have surpassed this level in 
      older women in the Israeli community setting. OBJECTIVES: To identify age groups 
      of women in which fluoroquinolones may no longer be appropriate for empiric 
      treatment of UTI. METHODS: Resistance rates for ofloxacin were calculated for all 
      cases of uncomplicated UTI diagnosed during the first 5 months of 2005 in a 
      managed care organization (MCO) in Israel, in community-dwelling women aged 41-75 
      years. The women were without risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance. 
      Uncomplicated UTI was diagnosed with a urine culture positive for E. coli. The 
      data set was stratified for age, using 5 year intervals, and stratum-specific 
      resistance rates (% and 95% CI) were calculated. These data were analyzed to 
      identify age groups in which resistance rates have surpassed 10%. RESULTS: The 
      data from 1291 urine cultures were included. The crude resistance rate to 
      ofloxacin was 8.7% (95% CI 7.4 to 10.2). Resistance was lowest among the youngest 
      (aged 41-50 y) women (3.2%; 95% CI 1.11 to 5.18), approached 10% in women aged 
      51-55 years (7.1%; 95% CI 3.4 to 10.9), and reached 19.86% (95% CI 13.2 to 26.5) 
      among the oldest women (aged 56-75 y). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians who opt to treat 
      UTI in postmenopausal women empirically should consider prescribing drugs other 
      than fluoroquinolones. Concomitant longitudinal surveillance of both antibiotic 
      utilization patterns and uropathogen resistance rates should become routine 
      practice in this managed-care organization.
