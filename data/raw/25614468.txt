AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the diagnostic 
      performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multidetector computed 
      tomography (MDCT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) in the preoperative 
      locoregional staging of gastric cancer. METHODS: This study had Institutional 
      Review Board approval, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. 
      Fifty-two patients with biopsy-proven gastric cancer underwent preoperative 1.5-T 
      MRI, 64-channel MDCT and EUS. All images were analysed blind, and the results 
      were compared with histopathological findings according to the seventh edition of 
      the TNM classification. After the population had been divided on the basis of the 
      local invasion (T1-3 vs T4a-b) and nodal involvement (N0 vs N+), sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and accuracy were calculated 
      and diagnostic performance measures were assessed using the McNemar test. 
      RESULTS: For T staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (94%) than MDCT and MRI (65 
      and 76%; p = 0.02 and p = 0.08). MDCT and MRI had significantly higher 
      specificity (91 and 89%) than EUS (60%) (p = 0.0009 and p = 0.003). Adding MRI to 
      MDCT or EUS did not result in significant differences for sensitivity. For N 
      staging, EUS showed higher sensitivity (92%) than MRI and MDCT (69 and 73%; p = 
      0.01 and p = 0.02). MDCT showed better specificity (81%) than EUS and MRI (58 and 
      73%; p = 0.03 and p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Our prospective study confirmed the 
      leading role of EUS and MDCT in the staging of gastric cancer and did not prove, 
      at present, the value of the clinical use of MRI.
