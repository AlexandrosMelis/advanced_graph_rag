      Apply the Theory of Deliberate Practice?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Outcome feedback is the process of learning patient outcomes after 
      their care within the emergency department. We conducted a national survey of 
      Canadian Royal College emergency medicine (EM) residents and program directors to 
      determine the extent to which active outcome feedback and follow-up occurred. We 
      also compared the perceived educational value of outcome feedback between 
      residents and program directors. METHODS: We distributed surveys to all Royal 
      College-accredited adult and pediatric EM training programs using a modified 
      Dillman method. We analyzed the data using student's t-test for continuous 
      variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. RESULTS: We received 
      210 completed surveys from 260 eligible residents (80.8%) and 21 of 24 program 
      directors (87.5%) (overall 81.3%). Mandatory active outcome feedback was not 
      present in any EM training program for admitted or discharged patients (0/21). 
      Follow-up was performed electively by 89.4% of residents for patients admitted to 
      the hospital, and by 44.2% of residents for patients discharged home. A majority 
      of residents (76.9%) believed that patient follow-up should be mandatory compared 
      to 42.9% of program directors (p=0.002). The perceived educational value of 
      outcome feedback was 5.8/7 for residents and 5.1/7 for program directors 
      (difference 0.7; p=0.002) based on a seven-point Likert scale (1=not important; 
      7=very important). CONCLUSION: While Canadian EM training programs do not mandate 
      follow-up, it is performed electively by the majority of residents surveyed. 
      Residents place a significantly greater educational value on outcome feedback 
      than their program directors, and believe that follow-up should be a mandatory 
      component of EM residencies.
