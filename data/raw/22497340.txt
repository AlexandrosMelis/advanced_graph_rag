      input?

AB  - CONCLUSION: Otolith organs input influences the axis of horizontal semicircular 
      canal ocular reflex; therefore, the plane of compensatory eye movements induced 
      by the horizontal canal stimulation is not always parallel to the canal. 
      OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether horizontal canal ocular reflex is influenced by 
      otolith organs input. METHODS: The subjects were seven healthy humans. The right 
      ear was stimulated using ice-water. Each subject was kept in a left-ear-down 
      position for 20 s and then repositioned to a prone position, a right-ear-down 
      position and a supine position with 20 s intervals. Nystagmus was analysed using 
      three-dimensional video-oculography. RESULTS: Eye movements in the supine 
      position and the prone position were not in a symmetric fashion. Nystagmus in the 
      left-ear-down position and the right-ear-down position were not symmetric either. 
      These phenomena indicate that the axis of the eyeball rotation was affected by 
      the shift of the direction of gravity exerted on the head.
