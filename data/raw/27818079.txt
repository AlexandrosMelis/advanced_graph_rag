AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the outcomes and complications of the surgical 
      treatment of condylar fractures by the retromandibular transparotid approach. The 
      authors hypothesized that such an approach would be safe and reliable for the 
      treatment of most condylar fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective 
      evaluation of patients who underwent surgical reduction of a condylar fracture 
      from January 2012 to December 2014 at the Clinic of Dentistry and Maxillofacial 
      Surgery of the University Hospital of Verona (Verona, Italy) was performed. 
      Inclusion criteria were having undergone surgical treatment of condylar fractures 
      with a retromandibular transparotid approach and the availability of computed 
      tomograms of the preoperative and postoperative facial skeleton with a minimum 
      follow-up of 1 year. Static and dynamic occlusal function, temporomandibular 
      joint health status, presence of neurologic impairments, and esthetic outcomes 
      were evaluated in all patients. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 25 patients. 
      Preinjury occlusion and temporomandibular joint health were restored in most 
      patients. Esthetic outcomes were deemed satisfactory by clinicians and patients. 
      Neither permanent neurologic impairments nor major postoperative complications 
      were observed. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of the present study, the 
      retromandibular transparotid approach is a viable and safe approach for the 
      surgical treatment of condylar fractures.
