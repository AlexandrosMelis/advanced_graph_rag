TI  - Are there gender differences in the reasons why African Americans delay in 
      seeking medical help for symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction?
PG  - 221-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify gender differences in delay time and the reasons why 
      African Americans delay in seeking medical care for symptoms of acute myocardial 
      infarction (AMI). DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Five hospitals in the San 
      Francisco and East Bay areas. PATIENTS: Sixty-one African American men and women 
      diagnosed with an AMI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prehospital delay time. RESULTS: 
      Median delay time was longer for women compared to men (4.4 hours vs 3.5 hours), 
      although the difference was not significant. Single women delayed longer than 
      single men (P = .03), and women who were alone when symptoms began delayed longer 
      than women with someone (P = .03). Women who received advice to seek help or call 
      911 upon symptom onset had shorter delays compared to women who were not advised 
      to call 911 (P = .01). Men at home delayed longer than men who experienced their 
      symptoms outside the home (P = .01). Men with emergency room insurance delayed 
      longer than men without emergency room insurance (P = .03), and men who took an 
      ambulance to the hospital had shorter delay times than men who took other means 
      of transportation (P = .04). CONCLUSION: Women compared to men often delay 
      seeking treatment for an AMI, which further increases their risks. Our findings 
      suggest specific characteristics that can serve as a profile to those African 
      Americans most likely to delay seeking treatment for AMI.
