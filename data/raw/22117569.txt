AB  - AIM: This article reports a study to determine the feasibility of an advance care 
      planning model developed with Australian community palliative care services. 
      BACKGROUND: An effective advance care planning programme involves an 
      organizational wide commitment and preparedness for health service reform to 
      embed advance care planning into routine practice. Internationally, such 
      programmes have been implemented predominantly in aged and acute care with more 
      recent work in primary care. METHODS: A multi-site action research was conducted 
      over a 16-month period in 2007-2009 with three Victorian community palliative 
      care services. Using mixed method data collection strategies to assess 
      feasibility, we conducted a baseline audit of staff and clients; analysed 
      relevant documents (client records, policies, procedures and quality improvement 
      strategies) pre-implementation and post-implementation and conducted key 
      informant interviews (n = 9). SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Three community 
      palliative care services: one regional and two metropolitan services in Victoria, 
      Australia. RESULTS: The services demonstrated that it was feasible to embed the 
      Model into their organizational structures. Advance care planning conversations 
      and involvement of family was an important outcome measure rather than completion 
      rate of advance care planning documents in community settings. Services adapted 
      and applied their own concept of community, which widened the impact of the 
      model. Changes to quality audit processes were essential to consolidate the model 
      into routine palliative care practice. CONCLUSION: An advance care planning model 
      is feasible for community palliative care services. Quality audit processes are 
      an essential component of the Model with documentation of advance care planning 
      discussion established as an important outcome measure.
