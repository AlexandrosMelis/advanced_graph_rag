TI  - Do antibiotics decrease post-tonsillectomy morbidity?
PG  - 705-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A tonsillectomy audit was carried out and compared with other studies, 
      to emphasize the role of antibiotics. METHODS: This study was carried out at 
      North West Armed Forces Hospital, Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, during the year 
      January 1999 through to December 1999. This is a retrospective study of patients 
      who had tonsillectomy with or with adenoidectomy, the topics audited included 
      indication for surgery, grade of surgeon, method of surgery, length of hospital 
      stay, complications and the use of postoperative antibiotics. RESULTS: A total of 
      185 patients underwent tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy. The patients 
      age ranged between 2 years to 53 years and the majority were children. In our 
      audit we found no difference with regard to grade of surgeons, method of 
      hemostasis in the outcome of surgery. Moreover, postoperative antibiotics had no 
      role in pain control, postoperative fever, secondary hemorrhage or reduction in 
      hospital stay. The administration of analgesics on the basis of, as required, had 
      poor pain control. CONCLUSION: Post tonsillectomy antibiotics did not prove to 
      have a role in minimizing postoperative morbidity. Moreover, analgesics given on 
      the basis of as required had a limited value.
