TI  - Is the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene a candidate for 
      schizophrenia?

AB  - BACKGROUND: : The histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, HINT1, hydrolyzes 
      adenosine 5'-monophosphoramidate substrates such as AMP-morpholidate. The human 
      HINT1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, a region implicated in linkage 
      studies of schizophrenia. HINT1 had been shown to have different expression in 
      postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls. It was 
      also found to be associated with the dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine 
      transmission, thus suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric 
      diseases. METHODS: : In this work, we studied 8 SNPs around the HINT1 gene region 
      using the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF, 1350 
      subjects and 273 pedigrees) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia 
      (ICCSS, 655 affected subjects and 626 controls). The expression level of HINT1 
      was compared between the postmortem brain cDNAs from schizophrenic patients and 
      unaffected controls provided by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. RESULTS: 
      : We found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several 
      SNPs for both ISHDSF and ICCSS samples in sex-stratified analyses. However, the 
      sex effect differed between the two samples. In expression studies, no 
      significant difference in expression was observed between patients and controls. 
      However, significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis and rs3864283 genotypes 
      were observed. CONCLUSION: : Data from both association and expression studies 
      suggested that variants at HINT1 may be associated with schizophrenia and the 
      associations may be sex-specific. However, the markers showing associations were 
      in high LD to the SPEC2/PDZ-GEF2/ACSL6 locus reported previously in the same 
      samples. This made it difficult to separate the association signals amongst these 
      genes. Other independent studies may be necessary to distinguish these candidate 
      genes.
