      to a hospital merger in Sweden.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Swedish hospital mergers seem to stem from a conviction among policy 
      makers that bigger hospitals lead to lower average costs and improved clinical 
      outcomes. The effects of mergers in the form of multisited hospitals have not 
      been systematically evaluated. The purpose of this article is to contribute to 
      this area of knowledge by exploring responses to the merger of Blekinge Hospital. 
      METHODS: The evaluation was guided by the philosophy of triangulation. A 
      questionnaire was sent to 597 randomly selected employees, that is 24% of the 
      health care staff. Four hundred ninety-eight employees answered the 
      questionnaire, giving a response rate of 83%. Furthermore, interviews of 
      different groups of stakeholders were conducted. RESULTS: A moderate increase of 
      quality was assessed, which, a low proportion of the employees perceived had 
      decisively or largely to do with the merger. The majority perceives economical 
      incentives as the drivers of change, but, at the same time, only 10% of this 
      group believes this target was reached completely or to a large extent. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The employees believe the merger has neither generated economy of 
      scale advantages nor substantial quality improvement. Instead, it seems more 
      rewarding to promote cross-functional collaboration together with clinical 
      specialisation. Needs for both integration and differentiation could thereby be 
      fulfilled.
