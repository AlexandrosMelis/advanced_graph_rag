TI  - Suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty, is it an effective alternative to 
      nasal packing?
PG  - 1534-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss and compare the results of suturing the nasal septum after 
      septoplasty with the results of nasal packing. METHODS: A prospective study, 
      which was performed at Prince Hashem Military Hospital in Zarqa, Jordan and 
      Prince Rashed Military Hospital in Irbid, Jordan between September 2005 and 
      August 2006 included 169 consecutive patients that underwent septoplasty. The 
      patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. After completion of surgery, the 
      nasal septum was sutured in the first group while nasal packing was performed in 
      the second group. RESULTS: Thirteen patients (15.3%) in the first group and 11 
      patients (13%) in the second group had minor oozing in the first 24 hours, 4 
      patients (4.8%) had bleeding after removal of the pack in the second group. Four 
      patients (4.8%) developed septal hematoma in the second group. Two patients 
      (2.4%) had septal perforation in the second group. One patient (1.1%) in the 
      first group, and 5 patients (5.9%) in the second group had postoperative 
      adhesions. Five patients (5.9%) were found to have remnant deviated nasal septum 
      in each group. The operating time was 4 minutes longer in the first group. 
      CONCLUSION: Septal suturing after septoplasty offers the following advantages: 
      elimination of discomfort for the patients, minimal complications, the outcome is 
      almost the same as with nasal packing, and finally the hospital stay is less than 
      with nasal packing. Therefore, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty 
      should be a preferred alternative to nasal packing.
