TI  - Percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules: is aspiration 
      of ethanol-mixed fluid advantageous?
PG  - 2122-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We evaluated the differences between percutaneous ethanol 
      injection with and without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid for treatment of 
      benign cystic thyroid nodules. METHODS: We examined 60 patients with benign 
      cystic thyroid nodules confirmed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy and divided 
      them into 2 groups according to nonaspiration (group A, n = 30) or aspiration 
      (group B, n = 30) of ethanol-mixed fluid after intracystic ethanol injection. We 
      evaluated in both groups the complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the 
      thyroid nodule on follow-up ultrasonography (first follow-up ultrasonography; 
      mean, 4.6 months in group A; mean, 4.4 months in group B) (chi-square test), side 
      effects or complications during and after the procedure (chi-square test), and 
      the total procedure time (Student t test). RESULTS: Most patients showed complete 
      disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule (group A, n = 29; group 
      B, n = 28), and they revealed no recurrence on follow-up ultrasonography. There 
      was no statistical difference in the success rates between group A and group B (P 
      > .05). Pain, the most common side effect, and other mild side effects or 
      complications occurred in small numbers of patients in each group, but there was 
      no significant difference in side effects or complications between the 2 groups 
      (P > .05), except for intracystic hemorrhage (P < .05) and the complaint of all 
      group B patients due to a double puncture (P < .001). The total procedure time 
      was nearly double in group B than in group A because of the additional 
      procedures, such as complete evacuation of the ethanol-mixed fluid and the 
      10-minute compression. CONCLUSION: Percutaneous ethanol injection without 
      aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid seems to be the preferable method of treatment 
      of benign cystic thyroid nodules from the perspective of both the physician and 
      the patient.
