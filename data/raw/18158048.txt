TI  - Histologic evaluation of the testicular remnant associated with the vanishing 
      testes syndrome: is surgical management necessary?
PG  - 1204-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is controversy surrounding the optimal management of the 
      testicular remnant associated with the vanishing testes syndrome. Some urologists 
      advocate the need for surgical exploration, whereas others believe this is 
      unnecessary. These differing opinions are based on the variable reports of viable 
      germ cell elements found within the testicular remnants. To better understand the 
      pathology associated with this syndrome and the need for surgical management, we 
      reviewed our experience regarding the incidence of viable germ cell elements 
      within the testicular remnant. METHODS: An institutional review board-approved, 
      retrospective review was performed of all consecutive patients undergoing 
      exploration for a nonpalpable testis at Eastern Virginia Medical School and 
      Geisinger Medical Center between 1994 and 2006. Patients who were found to have 
      spermatic vessels and a vas deferens exiting a closed internal inguinal ring were 
      included in this analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients underwent removal of the 
      testicular remnant. Patient age ranged from 11 to 216 months. In 8 of the 
      specimens (14%), we identified viable germ cell elements. In an additional 4 
      patients (7%), we identified seminiferous tubules without germ cell elements. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In our review, we identified that a significant number of testicular 
      remnants associated with the vanishing testes syndrome can harbor viable germ 
      cell elements or seminiferous tubules. The exact fate of these residual elements 
      remains unknown; however, there may exist the potential for malignant 
      transformation. Given the potential for malignant degeneration, we believe that 
      these remnants should be removed.
