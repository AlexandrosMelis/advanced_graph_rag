AB  - BACKGROUND: This study investigated whether the time from emergency room 
      registration to appendectomy (ETA) would affect the incidence of perforation and 
      postoperative complications in patients with acute appendicitis. METHODS: 
      Patients who underwent an appendectomy at the Ren-Ai branch of Taipei City 
      Hospital between January 2010 and October 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. 
      Their demographics, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, body temperature, 
      computed tomography scan usage, operation method, pathology report, postoperative 
      complication, length of hospital stay, and ETA were abstracted. Multivariate 
      analysis was performed to search the predictors, including ETA, of outcomes for 
      the perforation and postoperative complication rates. RESULTS: A total of 236 
      patients were included in the study. Perforation occurred in 12.7% (30/236) and 
      postoperative complications developed in 24.1% (57/236) of these patients. There 
      were 121 patients with ETA <8 hours, 88 patients with ETA of 8-24 hours, and 27 
      patients with ETA >24 hours; patients with ETA >24 hours had significantly longer 
      hospital stay. Univariate analysis showed that perforated patients were 
      significantly older, and had higher C-reactive protein level, longer hospital 
      stay, and higher complication rate. Patients who developed postoperative 
      complications were significantly older, and had higher neutrophil count, less use 
      of computed tomography, and higher open appendectomy rate. After multivariate 
      analysis, age >/=55 years was the only predictor for perforation [odds ratio (OR) = 
      3.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.54-8.68]; for postoperative complications, 
      age >/=55 years (OR = 1.65; 95% CI, 1.84-3.25), perforated appendicitis (OR = 3.17; 
      95% CI, 1.28-7.85), and open appendectomy (OR = 3.21; 95% CI, 1.36-7.58) were 
      associated. ETA was not a significant predictor in both analyses. CONCLUSION: In 
      our study, it was observed that although longer ETA was associated with longer 
      hospitalization, ETA was not correlated with postoperative complications. Our 
      results inclined toward the position that appendectomy can be performed as a 
      semielective surgery.
