AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating 
      phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: A total of 123 dysphonic 
      individuals with benign vocal pathologies were recruited. They were given either 
      genuine acupuncture (n = 40), sham acupuncture (n = 44), or no treatment (n = 39) 
      for 6 weeks (two 30-minute sessions/wk). The genuine acupuncture group received 
      needles puncturing nine voice-related acupoints for 30 minutes, two times a week 
      for 6 weeks, whereas the sham acupuncture group received blunted needles 
      stimulating the skin surface of the nine acupoints for the same frequency and 
      duration. The no-treatment group did not receive any intervention but attended 
      just the assessment sessions. One-hundred seventeen subjects completed the study 
      (genuine acupuncture = 40; sham acupuncture = 43; and no treatment = 34), but 
      only 84 of them had a complete set of vocal functions and quality of life 
      measures (genuine acupuncture = 29; sham acupuncture = 33; and no-treatment = 22) 
      and 42 of them with a complete set of endoscopic data (genuine acupuncture = 16; 
      sham acupuncture = 15; and no treatment = 11). RESULTS: Significant improvement 
      in vocal function, as indicated by the maximum fundamental frequency produced, 
      and also perceived quality of life, were found in both the genuine and sham 
      acupuncture groups, but not in the no-treatment group. Structural (morphological) 
      improvements were, however, only noticed in the genuine acupuncture group, which 
      demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that acupuncture of voice-related acupoints 
      could bring about improvement in vocal function and healing of vocal fold 
      lesions.
