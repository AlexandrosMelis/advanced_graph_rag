AB  - PURPOSE: Patient outcome after resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLM) 
      following second-line preoperative chemotherapy (PCT) performed for insufficient 
      response or toxicity of the first-line, is little known and has here been 
      compared to the outcome following first-line. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 
      2005 to June 2013, 5624 and 791 consecutive patients of a prospective 
      international cohort received 1 and 2 PCT lines before CLM resection (group 1 and 
      2, respectively). Survival and prognostic factors were analysed. RESULTS: After a 
      mean follow-up of 30.1 months, there was no difference in survival from CLM 
      diagnosis (median, 3-, and 5-year overall survival [OS]: 58.6 months, 76% and 49% 
      in group 2 versus 58.9 months, 71% and 49% in group 1, respectively, P = 0.32). 
      After hepatectomy, disease-free survival (DFS) was however shorter in group 2: 
      17.2 months, 27% and 15% versus 19.4 months, 32% and 23%, respectively 
      (P = 0.001). Among the initially unresectable patients of group 1 and 2, no 
      statistical difference in OS or DFS was observed. Independent predictors of worse 
      OS in group 2 were positive primary lymph nodes, extrahepatic disease, tumour 
      progression on second line, R2 resection and number of hepatectomies/year <50. 
      Positive primary nodes, synchronous and bilateral metastases were predictors of 
      shorter DFS. Initial unresectability did not impact OS or DFS in group 2. 
      CONCLUSION: CLM resection following second-line PCT, after oncosurgically 
      favourable selection, could bring similar OS compared to what observed after 
      first-line. For initially unresectable patients, OS or DFS is comparable between 
      first- and second-line PCT. Surgery should not be denied after the failure of 
      first-line chemotherapy.
