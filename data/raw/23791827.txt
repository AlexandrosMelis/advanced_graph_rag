AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the utility of risk stratification of 
      gynecologic oncology patients with neutropenic fever (NF). METHODS: A 
      retrospective chart review of gynecologic cancer patients admitted with NF from 
      2007 to 2011 was performed, wherein demographic, oncologic, and NF 
      characteristics (hospitalization length, complications, and death) were 
      collected. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) 
      risk index score was calculated; low risk was considered >/= 21. SAS 9.2 was used 
      for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Eighty-three patients met the study criteria. 
      Most (92%) were Caucasian and had advanced stage disease (71%). Primary tumors 
      were 58% ovary, 35% endometrium, and 6% cervix. All patients were receiving 
      chemotherapy on admission (72% for primary, 28% for recurrent disease). 
      Forty-eight percent had a positive culture, and most (58%) positive cultures were 
      urine. Seventy-six percent of patients were considered low risk. High-risk 
      patients were more likely to have a severe complication (10% versus 50%, 
      p=0.0003), multiple severe complications (3% versus 20%, p=0.0278), ICU admission 
      (2% versus 40%, p<0.0001), overall mortality (2% versus 15%, p=0.0417), and death 
      due to neutropenic fever (0% versus 15%, p=0.0124). MASCC had a positive 
      predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 90%. The median MASCC 
      score for all patients was 22 (range, 11-26), but the median MASCC score for 
      those with death or a severe complication was 17 (range, 11-24). CONCLUSION: 
      Based on this pilot data, MASCC score appears promising in determining 
      suitability for outpatient management of NF in gynecologic oncology patients. 
      Prospective study is ongoing to confirm safety and determine impact on cost.
