      cardiovascular phenotype and risk among black Africans?

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is not known whether common carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) 
      can serve as a surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk among black Africans. 
      Therefore, we examined whether CIMT differed significantly among individuals with 
      distinct cardiovascular phenotype and correlated significantly with traditional 
      cardiovascular risk factors in a black African population. METHODS: CIMT was 
      measured in 456 subjects with three distinct cardiovascular phenotypes - 175 
      consecutive Nigerian African stroke patients, 161 hypertensive patients without 
      stroke and 120 normotensive non-smoking adults. For each pair of cardiovascular 
      phenotypes, c-statistics were obtained for CIMT and traditional vascular risk 
      factors (including age, gender, weight, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol, 
      systolic and diastolic blood pressures, fasting plasma glucose, fasting total 
      cholesterol). Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify 
      bivariate relationships. FINDINGS: Bilaterally, CIMT was significantly different 
      among the three cardiovascular phenotypes (right: p < 0.001, F = 33.8; left: 
      p < 0.001, F = 48.6). CIMT had a higher c-statistic for differentiating stroke 
      versus normotension (c = 0.78 right; 0.82 left, p < 0.001) and hypertension 
      versus normotension (c = 0.65 right; 0.71 left, p < 0.001) than several 
      traditional vascular risk factors. Bilaterally, combining all subjects, CIMT was 
      the only factor that correlated significantly (right: 0.12 </= r </= 0.41, 
      0.018 </= p < 0.0001; left: 0.18 </= r </= 0.41, 0.005 </= p < 0.0001) to all the 
      traditional cardiovascular risk factors assessed. CONCLUSION: Our findings 
      support CIMT as a significant indicator of both cardiovascular risk and phenotype 
      among adult black Africans. However, specific thresholds need to be defined based 
      on prospective studies.
