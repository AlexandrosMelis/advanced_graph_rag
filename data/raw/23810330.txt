AB  - AIMS: Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) aims to control nerve-sparing total 
      mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer in order to improve patients' 
      functional outcome. This study was designed to compare the urogenital and 
      anorectal functional outcome of TME with and without IONM of innervation to the 
      bladder and the internal anal sphincter. METHODS: A consecutive series of 150 
      patients with primary rectal cancer were analysed. Fifteen match pairs with open 
      TME and combined urogenital and anorectal functional assessment at follow up were 
      established identical regarding gender, tumour site, tumour stage, neoadjuvant 
      radiotherapy and type of surgery. Urogenital and anorectal function was evaluated 
      prospectively on the basis of self-administered standardized questionnaires, 
      measurement of residual urine volume and longterm-catheterization rate. RESULTS: 
      Newly developed urinary dysfunction after surgery was reported by 1 of 15 
      patients in the IONM group and by 6 of 15 in the control group (p = 0.031). 
      Postoperative residual urine volume was significantly higher in the control 
      group. At follow up impaired anorectal function was present in 1 of 15 patients 
      undergoing TME with IONM and in 6 of 15 without IONM (p = 0.031). The IONM group 
      showed a trend towards a lower rate of sexual dysfunction after surgery. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study TME with IONM was associated with significant lower 
      rates of urinary and anorectal dysfunction. Prospective randomized trials are 
      mandatory to evaluate the definite role of IONM in rectal cancer surgery.
