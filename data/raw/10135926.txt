TI  - Is oral endotracheal intubation efficacy impaired in the helicopter environment?
PG  - 319-21
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients transported by helicopter often require advanced airway 
      management. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not the 
      in-flight environment of air medical transport in a BO-105 helicopter impairs the 
      ability of flight nurses to perform oral endotracheal intubation. SETTING: The 
      study was conducted in an MBB BO-105 helicopter. METHODS: Flight nurses performed 
      three manikin intubations in each of the two study environments: on an emergency 
      department stretcher and in-flight in the BO-105 helicopter. RESULTS: The mean 
      time required for in-flight intubation (25.9 +/- 10.9 seconds) was significantly 
      longer than the corresponding time (13.2 +/- 2.8 seconds) required for intubation 
      in the control setting (ANOVA, F = 38.7, p < .001). All intubations performed in 
      the control setting were placed correctly in the trachea; there were two (6.7%) 
      esophageal intubations in the in-flight setting. The difference in appropriate 
      endotracheal intubation between the two settings was not significant (chi 2 = 
      0.3; p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Oral endotracheal intubation in the in-flight setting 
      of the BO-105 helicopter takes approximately twice as long as intubation in a 
      ground setting. The results support pre-flight intubation of patients who appear 
      likely to require urgent intubation during air medical transport in the BO-105 
      helicopter.
