TI  - Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to 
      sentinel lymph node biopsy?
PG  - 10-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically positive axillary nodes are widely considered a 
      contraindication to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in breast cancer, yet no 
      data support this mandate. In fact, data from the era of axillary lymph node 
      dissection (ALND) suggest that clinical examination of the axilla is falsely 
      positive in as many as 30% of cases. Here we report the results of SLN biopsy in 
      a selected group of breast cancer patients with palpable axillary nodes 
      classified as either moderately or highly suspicious for metastasis. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Among 2,027 consecutive SLN biopsy procedures performed by two 
      experienced surgeons, clinically suspicious axillary nodes were identified in 
      106, and categorized as group 1 (asymmetric enlargement of the ipsilateral 
      axillary nodes moderately suspicious for metastasis, n = 62) and group 2 
      (clinically positive axillary nodes highly suspicious for metastasis, n = 44). 
      RESULTS: Clinical examination of the axilla was inaccurate in 41% of patients (43 
      of 106) overall, and was falsely positive in 53% of patients (33 of 62) with 
      moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients (10 of 44) with highly suspicious 
      nodes. False-positive results were less frequent with larger tumor size (p = 
      0.002) and higher histologic grade (p = 0.002), but were not associated with age, 
      body mass index, or a previous surgical biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical axillary 
      examination in breast cancer is subject to false-positive results, and is by 
      itself insufficient justification for axillary lymph node dissection. If other 
      means of preoperative assessment such as palpation- or image-guided fine needle 
      aspiration are negative or indeterminate, then SLN biopsy deserves wider 
      consideration as an alternative to routine axillary lymph node dissection in the 
      clinically node-positive setting.
