TI  - [Can the postoperative pain level be predicted preoperatively?].
PG  - 541-5
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: We searched for factors present preoperatively which could 
      be used to predict the intensity of postoperative pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We 
      undertook a prospective study among all patients aged over 18 years who underwent 
      shoulder surgery from January to September 2004 in our unit. The study included 
      86 patients for which the following data were noted preoperatively: past history 
      of pain, intensity and duration of prior pain, triggering factors, localization, 
      psychological context. The intensity of the postoperative pain was measured on a 
      visual analog scale (VAS); measurements were noted up to 24 hours postop then at 
      one month. Data processing was performed with Statview5.5. RESULTS: Significant 
      postoperative pain was correlated with a prior history of surgical pain, with 
      duration of prior pain, with intensity of preoperative pain, and with depression. 
      DISCUSSION: Significant sustained preoperative pain can favor memory of pain 
      leading to postoperative sensitivization of nociception neurons. Intense 
      postoperative pain can favor the development of refractory chronic pain. 
      CONCLUSION: Significant postoperative pain can be expected in the following 
      situations: pain after prior surgery, presence of chronic pain sustained for more 
      than six months, intense preoperative pain, state of depression.
