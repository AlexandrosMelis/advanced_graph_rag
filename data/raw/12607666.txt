TI  - Is extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection justifiable?
PG  - 525-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of our 
      surgical strategy for acute aortic dissection based on the extent of the 
      dissection and the site of the entry, with special emphasis on resection of all 
      dissected aortic segments if technically possible. METHODS: Between January 1995 
      and March 2001, 43 consecutive patients underwent operations for acute aortic 
      dissection. In all patients the distal repair was performed under circulatory 
      arrest without the use of an aortic cross-clamp. Fifteen patients underwent 
      aortic arch replacement with additional reconstruction of supra-aortic vessels in 
      3 patients. Complete replacement of all dissected tissue could be achieved in 21 
      patients (group 1). Because of the distal extent of the dissection beyond the 
      aortic arch, replacement of all the dissected tissue was not possible in 22 
      patients (group 2). RESULTS: Early mortality was 4.7% (2 patients), and the 
      incidence of perioperative cerebrovascular events was 7.0% (3 patients). All of 
      these events occurred in group 2 (p < 0.025). During the follow-up period of 6 
      years or less, 5 patients died, all from causes not related to the aorta or the 
      aortic valve. A persisting patent false lumen was observed in 14 of the 36 
      surviving patients (39%). CONCLUSIONS: Extended replacement of the dissected 
      ascending aorta and aortic arch can be done with good early and midterm results, 
      even though it requires a complex surgical technique. Therefore we advocate 
      complete replacement of the dissected parts of the aorta in all patients in whom 
      this is technically possible.
