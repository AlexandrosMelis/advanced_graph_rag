TI  - In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic 
      pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role?
PG  - 843-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is a common condition 
      which presents in infants at 2-12 weeks of postnatal life, and whose cause 
      remains obscure. Multiple associated abnormalities have been recognized within 
      the external hypertrophied pyloric muscle layer, but the internal component of 
      the pyloric mucosa has received scant attention in the literature to date. Our 
      purpose in this study was to show that pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant 
      finding in infants with IHPS, to discuss its possible cause, and to explore the 
      hypothesis of a relationship between pyloric mucosal redundancy and the 
      development of IHPS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 102 consecutive infants 
      with surgically confirmed IHPS and determined the thickness of the pyloric mucosa 
      compared with the thickness of the surrounding hypertrophied muscle. Fifty-one 
      infants who did not have pyloric stenosis served as controls. RESULTS: Mean 
      mucosal thickness in patients with IHPS approximated mean muscle thickness, with 
      a ratio of 0.89. In infants with IHPS, the pyloric mucosa constitutes 
      approximately one third of the cross-sectional diameter of the pyloric mass and 
      fills and obstructs the pyloric canal. CONCLUSION: Mucosal redundancy is a 
      constant associated finding in IHPS. Although the origin of the redundancy and a 
      cause-and-effect relationship are difficult to establish, our findings support 
      the hypothesis that hypergastrinemia may be implicated in the pathogenesis of 
      IHPS, and suggest that mucosal thickening could be implicated as one of the 
      initiating factors in its development.
