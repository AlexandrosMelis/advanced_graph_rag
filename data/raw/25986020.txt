AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Adoption and implementation of evidence-based measures 
      for catheter care leads to reductions in central line-associated bloodstream 
      infection (CLABSI) rates in the NICU. The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
      whether this rate reduction is sustainable for at least 1 year and to identify 
      key determinants of this sustainability at the NICU of the Floating Hospital for 
      Children at Tufts Medical Center. METHODS: We reviewed the incidence of CLABSIs 
      in the NICU temporally to the implementation of new practice policies and 
      procedures, from July 2008 to December 2013. RESULTS: Adoption of standardized 
      care practices, including bundles and checklists, was associated with a 
      significant reduction of the CLABSI rate to zero for >370 consecutive days in our 
      NICU in 2012. Overall, our CLABSI rates decreased from 4.1 per 1000 line days in 
      2009 (13 infections; 3163 line days) to 0.94 in 2013 (2 infections; 2115 line 
      days), which represents a 77% reduction over a 5-year period. In the first 
      quarter of 2013, there was a brief increase in CLABSI rate to 3.3 per 1000 line 
      days; after a series of interventions, the CLABSI rate was maintained at zero for 
      >600 days. Ongoing training, surveillance, and vigilance with catheter insertion 
      and maintenance practices and improved documentation were identified as key 
      drivers for success. CONCLUSIONS: High-quality training, strict compliance with 
      evidence-based guidelines, and thorough documentation is associated with 
      significant reductions in CLABSIs. Mindful organizing may lead to a better 
      understanding of what goes into a unit's ability to handle peak demands and 
      sustain extraordinary performance in the long-term.
