TI  - Recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation: is there an 
      association?
PG  - 384.e1-6; discussion 384.e6-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is an 
      association between skewed X-inactivation and recurrent spontaneous abortion in a 
      large, well-defined sample of women with recurrent loss. STUDY DESIGN: 
      X-chromosome inactivation patterns were compared in 5 groups of women. Group 1 
      (recurrent spontaneous abortion) consisted of 357 women with 2 or more 
      spontaneous losses. In group 2 (infertility), there were 349 subjects from 
      infertility practices recruited at the time of a positive serum beta-human 
      chorionic gonadotropin. Group 3 (spontaneous abortion) women (n = 81) were 
      recruited at the time of an ultrasound diagnosis of an embryonic demise or an 
      anembryonic gestation. Groups 4 (primiparous) and 5 (multiparous) were healthy 
      pregnant subjects previously enrolled in another study to determine the incidence 
      and cause of pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and intrauterine 
      growth restriction. The Primiparous group included 114 women in their first 
      pregnancy, whereas the Multiparous group consisted of 79 women with 2 or more 
      pregnancies but without pregnancy loss. RESULTS: The rate of extreme skewing (90% 
      or greater) in the recurrent spontaneous abortion population was 8.6%, and not 
      statistically different from any of the other groups, except the Primiparous 
      group (1.0%, P < .01). The incidence of X-inactivation skewing of 90% or greater 
      was no different whether there had been at least 1 live birth (9.9%), or no 
      previous live births and at least 3 losses (5.6%, P > .05). When age and skewing 
      of 90% or greater are compared, subjects with extreme skewing have a mean age of 
      2 years older than those without extreme skewing (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Skewed 
      X-inactivation is not associated with recurrent spontaneous abortion but is 
      associated with increasing maternal age.
