TI  - Do dermatomyositis and polymyositis affect similar thigh muscles? A comparative 
      MRI-based study.
PG  - 1098-1100
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) commonly cause weakness of 
      the thigh muscles. However, it is debated whether DM and PM affect similar thigh 
      muscles. Muscle oedema on fat-suppressed MRI sequences is thought to represent 
      active inflammation. In this study, we aimed to assess which thigh muscle groups 
      are preferentially inflamed in DM and PM, respectively, using short-tau 
      inversion-recovery MRI sequences. METHODS: We analysed 71 patients from 2 
      Rheumatology centres, 31 with DM and 40 with PM diagnosed according to the Bohan 
      and Peter criteria. MRI oedema (1=present, 0=absent) was assessed bilaterally on 
      fat-suppressed sequences in 17 pelvic floor and thigh muscles. An MRI oedema 
      score (range 0-17) was calculated by adding the separate scores bilaterally and 
      dividing them by two. Inter-rater variability was assessed by intraclass 
      correlation coefficient. Fisher's exact test was used to compare binomial data. 
      RESULTS: Age and gender ratio were similar in patients with DM and PM. Disease 
      duration (months, mean+/-SD) was shorter (20+/-31) in DM than in PM (53+/-69) (p=0.02). 
      The intraclass correlation coefficient between the radiologists involved was 
      0.78. Muscle oedema was more common in DM than in PM except in the posterior 
      thigh muscles. In particular, 68% of patients with DM had involvement of at least 
      one anterior thigh muscle versus 38% of patients with PM (p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Compared with PM, DM affects more thigh muscles, except those of the posterior 
      compartment, which are equally involved in both disorders. These findings may be 
      useful to target physiotherapy at the more frequently affected muscles.
