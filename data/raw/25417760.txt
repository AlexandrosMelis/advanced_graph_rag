TI  - Risk factors for major depression during midlife among a community sample of 
      women with and without prior major depression: are they the same or different?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women's vulnerability for a first lifetime-onset of major depressive 
      disorder (MDD) during midlife is substantial. It is unclear whether risk factors 
      differ for first lifetime-onset and recurrent MDD. Identifying these risk factors 
      can provide more focused depression screening and earlier intervention. This 
      study aims to evaluate whether lifetime psychiatric and health histories, 
      personality traits, menopausal status and factors that vary over time, e.g. 
      symptoms, are independent risk factors for first-onset or recurrent MDD across 13 
      annual follow-ups. METHOD: Four hundred and forty-three women, aged 42-52 years, 
      enrolled in the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation in Pittsburgh and 
      participated in the Mental Health Study. Psychiatric interviews obtained 
      information on lifetime psychiatric disorders at baseline and on occurrences of 
      MDD episodes annually. Psychosocial and health-related data were collected 
      annually. Cox multivariable analyses were conducted separately for women with and 
      without a MDD history at baseline. RESULTS: Women without lifetime MDD at 
      baseline had a lower risk of developing MDD during midlife than those with a 
      prior MDD history (28% v. 59%) and their risk profiles differed. Health 
      conditions prior to baseline and during follow-ups perception of functioning (ps 
      < 0.05) and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (p = 0.08) were risk factors for first 
      lifetime-onset MDD. Being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms and a 
      prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The menopausal transition warrants attention as a period of 
      vulnerability to MDD recurrence, while health factors and VMS should be 
      considered important risk factors for first lifetime-onset of MDD during midlife.
