AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective multicenter study of series of 12 patients with 
      spinal cord sarcoidosis who underwent surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      postoperative outcomes of patients with cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis 
      accompanied with compressive myelopathy and effect of decompressive surgery on 
      the prognosis of sarcoidosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Sarcoidosis is a 
      chronic, multisystem noncaseating granulomatous disease. It is difficult to 
      differentiate spinal cord sarcoidosis from cervical compressive myelopathy. There 
      are no studies regarding the coexistence of compressive cervical myelopathy with 
      cervical spinal cord sarcoidosis and the effect of decompressive surgery. 
      METHODS: Nagoya Spine Group database included 1560 cases with cervical myelopathy 
      treated with cervical laminectomy or laminoplasty from 2001 to 2005. A total of 
      12 patients (0.08% of cervical myelopathy) were identified spinal cord 
      sarcoidosis treated with decompressive surgery. As a control subject, 8 patients 
      with spinal cord sarcoidosis without compressive lesion who underwent high-dose 
      steroid therapy without surgery were recruited. RESULTS: In the surgery group, 
      enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were mostly seen at C5-C6, 
      coincident with the maximum compression level in all cases. Postoperative 
      recovery rates in the surgery group at 1 week and 4 weeks were -7.4% and -1.1%, 
      respectively. Only 5 cases had showed clinical improvement, and the condition of 
      these 5 patients had worsened again at averaged 7.4 weeks after surgery. 
      Postoperative oral steroid therapy was initiated at an average of 6.4 weeks and 
      the average initial dose was 54.0 mg in the surgery group, while 51.3 mg in the 
      nonsurgery group. The recovery rate of the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, 
      which increased after steroid therapy, was better in the nonsurgery group (62.5%) 
      than in the surgery group (18.6%) with significant difference (P < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: The effect of decompression for spinal cord sarcoidosis with 
      compressive myelopathy was not evident. Early diagnosis for sarcoidosis from 
      other organ and steroid therapy should be needed.
