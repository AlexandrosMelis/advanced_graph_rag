TI  - Emergency double-balloon enteroscopy combined with real-time viewing of capsule 
      endoscopy: a feasible combined approach in acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal 
      bleeding?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: There are few data concerning emergency double-balloon 
      enteroscopy (DBE) and its usefulness in the management of severe acute obscure 
      gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). The aim of this retrospective study was to 
      evaluate emergency DBE and capsule endoscopy (CE) in patients with overt OGIB, 
      analyzing the feasibility of this combined approach. METHODS: Emergency DBE in 
      patients with overt OGIB was defined as performance within 24 h of symptom onset. 
      We reported 27 patients (16 men, mean age: 64.6 +/- 17.9 years) with overt severe 
      bleeding who underwent 29 emergency DBE (22 anterograde, 7 retrograde). Of 27 
      patients, 16 (59.3%) underwent CE with real time (RT) viewing. RESULTS: Patients 
      were diagnosed with the following: Dieulafoy's lesion (DL; n = 11, 40.7%), 
      angioectasia (n = 7, 25.9%), tumors (n = 4, 14.8%), diverticulum (n = 3, 11.1%), 
      ulcers (n = 2, 7.4%). We diagnosed 23 lesions amenable to endoscopic hemostasis 
      and successfully treated 21 of them (77.8%). DL detection rate was statistically 
      higher in the emergency DBE group than in OGIB patients with DBE done 24 h after 
      symptom onset (40.7% vs 0.9%, respectively, P < 0.001). Combined approach with RT 
      viewing by CE correctly modified DBE management in four patients (25%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Emergency DBE is feasible, safe and effective in acute OGIB and may 
      avoid major surgery, diagnosing and successfully treating most patients. Combined 
      approach with RT viewing by CE is especially useful to identify recurrent 
      bleeding vascular lesions such as DL that may be easily misdiagnosed by 
      non-emergency DBE.
