AB  - BACKGROUND: The intent of this study was to determine if the use of a single or 
      combination of static foot posture measurements can be used to predict rearfoot, 
      midfoot, and forefoot plantar surface area in individuals with pronated or normal 
      foot types. METHODS: Twelve foot measurements were collected on 52 individuals 
      (mean age 25.8 years) with the change in midfoot width used to place subjects in 
      a pronated or normal foot mobility group. Dynamic plantar contact area was 
      collected during walking with a pressure sensor platform. The 12 measures were 
      entered into a stepwise regression analysis to determine the optimal set of 
      measures associated with regional plantar surface area. RESULTS: A two variable 
      model was found to describe the relationship between the foot measurements and 
      forefoot plantar contact area (r(2)=0.79, p<0.0001). A four variable model was 
      found to describe the relationship between the foot measurements and midfoot 
      plantar contact area (r(2)=0.85, p<0.0001) in those individuals with a 1.26cm or 
      greater change in midfoot width. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that 
      clinicians can use a combination of simple, reliable and time efficient foot 
      measures to explain 79% and 85% of the plantar surface area in the forefoot and 
      midfoot, respectively.
