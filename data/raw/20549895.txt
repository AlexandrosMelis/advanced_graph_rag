      applying the rules of prevention?].

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has never been a nationally representative survey of medical 
      students' personal health-related practices, although they are inherently of 
      interest and may affect patient-counseling practices. This study evaluated the 
      health practices and the vaccination status of first year residents working at 
      the academic hospital Hotel-Dieu de France. METHODS: The medical files of all 
      medicine and surgery residents in their first year of specialization between the 
      years 2005 and 2008 were reviewed. These residents were required to go through a 
      preventive medical visit at the University Center of Family and Community Health. 
      RESULTS: One hundred and nine residents (109) were included in the study; 68 
      (6239%) were male and 41 (37.61%) were female with a mean age of 26 years. Only 6 
      residents (5.50%) practiced physical activity according to international 
      guidelines (more than three times a week for more than 30 minutes each time). 
      Most residents (n = 76 ; 69.73%) used to skip one or two meals especially 
      breakfast and as a consequence 30 male (44.11%) and 4 female (9.75%) students 
      were overweight, with a statistical difference between the two sexes (Fisher 
      test, p-value = 0.001). Twenty-eight residents (25.69%) were smokers with a male 
      predominance. Fourteen residents of both genders (12.84%) drank alcohol regularly 
      (> 3 times a week) and 71 (65.14%) had a drink occasionally (once a month or 
      less). Only 25 residents (23%) of the cohort had a complete and up-to-date 
      immunization status. The immunization gap was basically against measles, mumps, 
      rubella (MMR) and diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis (dT Polio). Ninety-nine 
      residents (90.83%) had full immunization against hepatitis B with an adequate 
      response in 78 residents (71.56%). CONCLUSION: This study showed that our 
      residents did not always have a healthy lifestyle especially when it comes to 
      physical activity and eating habits. They also lacked an adequate vaccination. 
      Interventions should take place in order to promote healthy life style and to 
      improve their vaccination status.
