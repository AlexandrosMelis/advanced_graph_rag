AB  - INTRODUCTION: Up to 30 % of patients who have undergone laparoscopic sleeve 
      gastrectomy require revision surgery for inadequate weight loss, weight regain, 
      and/or the development of severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms. The aim of this 
      retrospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic 
      fundectomy (LF) in cases of a residual fundus/neofundus development regarding 
      GERD symptoms. METHODS: The study group comprised 19 patients (17 female; mean 
      BMI 35.4 kg/m(2)) divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 10) patients with severe 
      GERD and evidence of residual fundus/neofundus, Hiatal hernia with good results 
      in terms of weight loss. Group B (n = 9) patients with severe GERD, a residual 
      fundus/neofundus, inadequate weight loss or weight regain. Fundectomy was 
      indicated when a residual fundus/neofundus was associated with severe GERD 
      symptoms. The presence of a residual fundus/neofundus was assessed by a barium 
      swallow and/or multislice computed tomography. RESULTS: No mortality or 
      intra-operative complications occurred. Five postoperative complications 
      occurred: 2 cases of bleeding, 1 mid-gastric stenosis and 2 leaks (10.5 %). All 
      patients experienced improvements in their GERD symptoms and stopped PPI 
      treatment. Group B exhibited an additional %EWL of 53.4 % at 24 months. 
      CONCLUSION: LF and cruroplasty is feasible and has good results in terms of GERD 
      symptoms control and additional weight loss. The high rate of postoperative 
      complications observed in this series remains a matter of concern. A re-sleeve 
      procedure might be considered as an alternative to RYGB/DS conversion restricted 
      to selected patients.
