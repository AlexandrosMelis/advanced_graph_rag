AB  - GOAL: It is generally considered that kidney grafts should be preserved at 4 
      degrees C during cold storage. However, actual temperature conditions are not 
      known. We decided to study the temperature levels during preservation with the 
      Biotainer storage can and Vitalpack transport pack. MATERIAL: Temperature was 
      monitored using the Thermobouton probe during preservation of pig kidneys, in the 
      same conditions used with human grafts. The probe recorded the temperature level 
      every 10 minutes during four days. We compared the results found with the new 
      storage can with results obtained in the same conditions with the storage can 
      formerly used by our team. We also studied the best position of the probe for 
      temperature monitoring and the influence of the amount of ice within the 
      transport pack on the temperature level. We then monitored the temperature during 
      the conservation of actual human kidney grafts harvested at our institution from 
      August 2007 to May 2008. RESULTS: The temperature levels were the same regardless 
      of the position of the probe within the transport pack. The lowest temperature 
      was maintained during 15 hours, and the temperature level stayed below 5 degrees 
      C for 57 hours with the new storage can. The former storage can maintained the 
      lowest temperature level for 80 minutes, and temperature reached 5 degrees C 
      after 10 hours 40 minutes. Temperature levels were similar when 2 or 4 kg of 
      crushed ice were used. We observed similar results when monitoring the 
      conservation of human grafts. CONCLUSION: The new storage can affords more stable 
      temperature levels when compared to the formerly used can. Since temperature is 
      stable during conservation, continuous monitoring in everyday practice does not 
      seem warranted.
