TI  - Midwives' competence: is it affected by working in a rural location?
PG  - 764
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rising health care costs and the need to consolidate expertise in 
      tertiary services have led to the centralisation of services. In the UK, the 
      result has been that many rural maternity units have become midwife-led. A key 
      consideration is that midwives have the skills to competently and confidently 
      provide maternity services in rural areas, which may be geographically isolated 
      and where the midwife may only see a small number of pregnant women each year. 
      Our objective was to compare the views of midwives in rural and urban settings, 
      regarding their competence and confidence with respect to 'competencies' 
      identified as being those which all professionals should have in order to provide 
      effective and safe care for low-risk women. METHOD: This was a comparative 
      questionnaire survey involving a stratified sample of remote and rural maternity 
      units and an ad hoc comparison group of three urban maternity units in Scotland. 
      Questionnaires were sent to 82 midwives working in remote and rural areas and 107 
      midwives working in urban hospitals with midwife-led units. RESULTS: The response 
      rate from midwives in rural settings was considerably higher (85%) than from 
      midwives in the urban areas (60%). Although the proportion of midwives who 
      reported that they were competent was broadly similar in the two groups, there 
      were some significant differences regarding specific competencies. Midwives in 
      the rural group were more likely to report competence for breech delivery (p = 
      0.001), while more urban midwives reported competence in skills such as 
      intravenous fluid replacement (p <0.001) and initial and discharge examination of 
      the newborn (p <0.001). Both groups reported facing barriers to continuing 
      professional development; however, more of the rural group had attended an 
      educational event within the last month (p <0.001). Lack of time was a greater 
      barrier for urban midwives (p = 0.02), whereas distance to training was greater 
      for rural midwives (p = 0.009). Lack of motivation or interest was significantly 
      higher in urban units (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: It is often assumed that midwives 
      in rural areas where there are fewer deliveries, will be less competent and 
      confident in their practice. Our exploratory study suggests that the issue of 
      competence is far more complex and deserves further attention.
