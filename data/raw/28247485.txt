      preeclampsia a prognostic factor for maternal and neonatal adverse outcome? A 
      retrospective cohort study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of the 
      first urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) for adverse maternal and neonatal 
      outcomes and how it relates to other prognostic factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We 
      performed a retrospective cohort study from December 2009 to February 2012 with 
      analysis of demographic, clinical and biochemical data from two obstetric day 
      assessment units in hospitals in Southeast Scotland. We included 717 pregnant 
      women, with singleton pregnancies after 20 weeks' gestation, referred for 
      evaluation of suspected preeclampsia and having their first ACR performed. The 
      ability of ACR to predict future outcomes was assessed in both univariable and 
      multivariable logistic regression models. The latter assessed its prognostic 
      value independent of (adjusting for) existing prognostic factors. Primary outcome 
      measures were maternal and neonatal composite adverse outcomes, and a secondary 
      outcome was gestation at delivery. RESULTS: In all, 204 women (28.5%) experienced 
      a composite adverse maternal outcome and 146 women (20.4%) experienced a 
      composite adverse neonatal outcome. Multivariate analysis of log-transformed ACR 
      demonstrated that a 1-unit increase in log ACR is associated with an increased 
      odds of adverse maternal [odds ratio 1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 
      1.45-1.80] and adverse neonatal (odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 1.02-1.29) composite 
      outcomes, and with reduced gestational age at delivery (coefficient: -0.46, 95% 
      CI -0.54 to -0.38). CONCLUSIONS: ACR is an independent prognostic factor for 
      maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes in suspected preeclampsia. ACR may be 
      useful to inform risk predictions within a prognostic model.
