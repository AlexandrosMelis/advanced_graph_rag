TI  - Does the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia exist?
PG  - 962-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The placement of the superficial cervical plexus block has been the 
      subject of controversy. Although the investing cervical fascia has been 
      considered as an impenetrable barrier, clinically, the placement of the block 
      deep or superficial to the fascia provides the same effective anesthesia. The 
      underlying mechanism is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      three-dimensional organization of connective tissues in the anterior region of 
      the neck. METHODS: Using a combination of dissection, E12 sheet plastination, and 
      confocal microscopy, fascial structures in the anterior cervical triangle were 
      examined in 10 adult human cadavers. RESULTS: In the upper cervical region, the 
      fascia of strap muscles in the middle and the fasciae of the submandibular glands 
      on both sides formed a dumbbell-like fascia sheet that had free lateral margins 
      and did not continue with the sternocleidomastoid fascia. In the lower cervical 
      region, no single connective tissue sheet extended directly between the 
      sternocleidomastoid muscles. The fascial structure deep to platysma in the 
      anterior cervical triangle comprised the strap fascia. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      provides anatomical evidence to indicate that the so-called investing cervical 
      fascia does not exist in the anterior triangle of the neck. Taking the previous 
      reports together, the authors' findings strongly suggest that deep potential 
      spaces in the neck are directly continuous with the subcutaneous tissue.
