TI  - The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option?
PG  - 651-4
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the accuracy achieved by a trained urology nurse 
      practitioner (UNP) and consultant urologist in detecting bladder tumours during 
      flexible cystoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-three patients underwent 
      flexible cystoscopy by both the UNP and consultant urologist, each unaware of the 
      other's findings. Before comparing the findings, each declared whether there was 
      tumour or any suspicious lesion requiring biopsy. RESULTS: Of 83 patients 
      examined by flexible cystoscopy, 26 were found to have a tumour or a suspicious 
      lesion. One tumour was missed by the UNP and one by the urologist; each tumour 
      was minute. Analysis using the chance-corrected proportional agreement (Kappa) 
      was 0.94, indicating very close agreement. CONCLUSION: A UNP can be trained to 
      perform cystoscopy and detect suspicious lesions as accurately as can a 
      consultant urologist. Legal and training issues in implementation are important.
