TI  - Cigarettes and cinema: does parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing reduce 
      adolescent smoking susceptibility?
PG  - 181.e1-6
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the relationship between exposure to pro-smoking messages in 
      media and susceptibility to smoking adoption among middle school students. The 
      hypothesis that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with 
      lower adolescent smoking susceptibility was tested. METHODS: A sample of 1687 
      6th-, 7th-, and 8th-grade students from four Wisconsin middle schools were 
      surveyed about their use of cigarettes, exposure to smoking in media, their views 
      of smoking, and peer smoking behaviors. RESULTS: An index of smoking 
      susceptibility was created using measures of cigarette use and future intention 
      to smoke. A zero-order correlation for parental restriction of R-rated movie 
      viewing and smoking susceptibility showed a strong association (r = -.36, p < 
      .001). A hierarchical logistic regression yielded odds ratios (ORs) for being 
      susceptible to or having tried smoking for three levels of parental R-rated movie 
      restriction. Results show that compared to full restriction, respondents with 
      partial or no restriction were more likely to be susceptible to smoking (partial 
      restriction: OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.5-2.8; no restriction: OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 
      2.3-4.6), when controlling for demographic factors, and family and friend 
      smoking. Analyses using a measure of smoking prevalence as the dependent variable 
      yielded similar results (partial restriction: OR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.2; no 
      restriction: OR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.7-3.7). CONCLUSIONS: Parental restriction of 
      R-rated movie viewing is associated with both lower adolescent smoking 
      susceptibility and lower smoking rates.
