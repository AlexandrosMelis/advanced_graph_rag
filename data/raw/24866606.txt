      ultrasound education?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of emergency ultrasound 
      (EUS) programs in the United States. To date, there is no evidence supporting 
      that EUS fellowships enhance residents' ultrasound (US) educational experiences. 
      The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of EUS fellowships on 
      emergency medicine (EM) residents' US education. METHODS: We conducted a 
      cross-sectional study at 9 academic medical centers. A questionnaire on US 
      education and bedside US use was pilot tested and given to EM residents. The 
      primary outcomes included the number of US examinations performed, scope of 
      bedside US applications, barriers to residents' US education, and US use in the 
      emergency department. The secondary outcomes were factors that would impact 
      residents' US education. The outcomes were compared between residency programs 
      with and without EUS fellowships. RESULTS: A total of 244 EM residents 
      participated in this study. Thirty percent (95% confidence interval, 24%-35%) 
      reported they had performed more than 150 scans. Residents in programs with EUS 
      fellowships reported performing more scans than those in programs without 
      fellowships (P = .04). Significant differences were noted in most applications of 
      bedside US between residency programs with and without fellowships (P < .05). 
      There were also significant differences in the barriers to US education between 
      residency programs with and without fellowships (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency 
      US fellowship programs had a positive impact on residents' US educational 
      experiences. Emergency medicine residents performed more scans overall and also 
      used bedside US for more advanced applications in programs with EUS fellowships.
