AB  - BACKGROUND: Immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) provides psychological benefit 
      to many early breast cancer patients however concerns persist regarding its 
      potential impact on chemotherapy delivery. We investigated the association 
      between IBR, complications and adjuvant chemotherapy delivery. METHOD: 
      Retrospective analysis of patients in an academic breast service, who underwent 
      mastectomy, with or without reconstruction, and received adjuvant chemotherapy. 
      RESULTS: Comparisons were made between 107 patients who received IBR and 113 who 
      received mastectomy alone. Those receiving IBR were on average younger, with 
      lower body mass index (BMI) and better prognoses. Overall complication rates were 
      comparable (mastectomy alone: 45.1% versus IBR: 35.5%, p = 0.2). There was more 
      return to surgery in the IBR group with 11.5% of tissue expanders requiring 
      removal, whilst more seromas occurred in the mastectomy group. There was no 
      significant difference in the median time to chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: We found 
      no evidence that IBR compromised the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy, although 
      there was a significant incidence of implant infection.
