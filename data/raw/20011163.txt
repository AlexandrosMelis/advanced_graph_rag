TI  - Can Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus?
PG  - E269-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: The surgical treatment of diabetes had witnessed progressive 
      development and success since the first case of pancreatic transplantation. 
      Although this was a great step, wide clinical application was limited by several 
      factors. Bariatric surgery such as gastric bypass is emerging as a promising 
      option in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The aim of this article is to 
      explore the current application of gastric bypass in patients with type 2 
      diabetes and the theoretical bases of gastric bypass as a treatment option for 
      type 1 diabetes. METHODS: We performed a MEDLINE search for articles published 
      from August 1955 to December 2008 using the words "surgical treatment of 
      diabetes," "etiology of diabetes" and "gastric bypass." RESULTS: We identified 
      3215 studies and selected 72 relevant papers for review. Surgical treatment of 
      diabetes is evolving from complex pancreatic and islets transplantation surgery 
      for type 1 diabetes with critical postoperative outcome and follow-up to a 
      metabolic surgery, including gastric bypass. Gastric bypass (no immune 
      suppression or graft rejection) has proven to be highly effective treatment for 
      obese patients and nonobese animals with type 2 diabetes. There are certain 
      shared criteria between types 1 and 2 diabetes, making a selected spectrum of the 
      disease a potential target for metabolic surgery to improve or cure diabetes. 
      CONCLUSION: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a promising option for lifelong treatment 
      of type 2 diabetes. It has the potential to improve or cure a selected spectrum 
      of type 1 diabetes when performed early in the disease. Further animal model 
      studies or randomized controlled trials are needed to support our conclusion.
