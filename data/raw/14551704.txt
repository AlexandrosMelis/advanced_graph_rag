TI  - [Can communication with terminally ill patients be taught? Evaluation of a course 
      model].
PG  - 477-83
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Communication with terminally ill patients is a main 
      responsibility of physicians. However, many physicians feel insufficiently 
      prepared for this task. Models of courses resulting in improvements of 
      communicative skills of participants have been published mainly in the 
      Anglo-American literature. This study describes the realization of a 2-day course 
      model based on the experiences of the first three courses of this kind in 
      Rhineland-Palatinate, and analyzes changes of participants' communication 
      behavior. METHODS: After each seminary, an evaluation form concerning 
      participants' satisfaction with the course was filled in. Furthermore, all course 
      participants received a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the 
      course, as well as 3 months afterwards. The participants were asked to assess 
      their own sense of security in seven different communication settings on a visual 
      analog scale, and to specify perceived changes in their communication behavior 3 
      months after the course. RESULTS: The first three courses were attended by 31 
      participants. Course evaluation revealed high satisfaction scores with methods as 
      well as with clarity and relevance of the contents. Self-assessment of 
      participants showed a growing sense of security in different communication 
      settings. Important increases could be demonstrated for communicating a diagnosis 
      of cancer with good or less good prognosis, recurrence of cancer or a far 
      progressive cancer disease without curative approach. 3 months after the course, 
      participants described multiple changes indicating increased sensibility and 
      professionalism in communication behavior. CONCLUSION: The realized communication 
      skills courses resulted in relevant changes in communication behaviour and 
      self-confidence of participants. Communication with terminally ill patients can 
      be taught.
