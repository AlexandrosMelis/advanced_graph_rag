      apnea: does it offer a better quality of life and sleep?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The recent literature shows an increased incidence of obstructive 
      sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). On the 
      other hand, there are no published studies related to continuous positive airway 
      pressure (CPAP) treatment in this patient group. Our aim was to assess the effect 
      of CPAP on sleep and overall life quality parameters in IPF patients with OSA and 
      to recognize and overcome possible difficulties in CPAP initiation and acceptance 
      by these patients. METHODS: Twelve patients (ten males and two females, age 
      67.1 +/- 7.2 years) with newly diagnosed IPF and moderate to severe OSA, confirmed 
      by overnight attended polysomnography, were included. Therapy with CPAP was 
      initiated after a formal in-lab CPAP titration study. The patients completed the 
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the 
      Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), the Fatigue Severity Scale 
      (FSS), the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory 
      (BDI) at CPAP initiation and after 1, 3, and 6 months of effective CPAP therapy. 
      RESULTS: A statistically significant improvement was observed in the FOSQ at 1, 
      3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation (baseline 12.9 +/- 2.9 vs. 14.7 +/- 2.6 vs. 
      15.8 +/- 2.1 vs. 16.9 +/- 1.9, respectively, p = 0.02). Improvement, although not 
      statistically significant, was noted in ESS score (9.2 +/- 5.6 vs. 7.6 +/- 4.9 vs. 
      7.5 +/- 5.3 vs. 7.7 +/- 5.2, p = 0.84), PSQI (10.7 +/- 4.4 vs. 10.1 +/- 4.3 vs. 9.4 +/- 4.7 
      vs. 8.6 +/- 5.2, p = 0.66), FSS (39.5 +/- 10.2 vs. 34.8 +/- 8.5 vs. 33.6 +/- 10.7 vs. 
      33.4 +/- 10.9, p = 0.44), SF-36 (63.2 +/- 13.9 vs. 68.9 +/- 13.5 vs. 72.1 +/- 12.9 vs. 
      74.4 +/- 11.3, p = 0.27), and BDI (12.9 +/- 5.5 vs. 10.7 +/- 4.3 vs. 9.4 +/- 4.8 vs. 
      9.6 +/- 4.5, p = 0.40). Two patients had difficulty complying with CPAP for a 
      variety of reasons (nocturnal cough, claustrophobia, insomnia) and stopped CPAP 
      use after the first month, despite intense follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff. 
      Heated humidification was added for all patients in order to improve the common 
      complaint of disabling nocturnal cough. CONCLUSION: Effective CPAP treatment in 
      IPF patients with OSA results in a significant improvement in daily living 
      activities based on the FOSQ, namely an OSA-specific follow-up instrument. 
      Improvement was also noted in other questionnaires assessing quality of life, 
      though not to a statistically significant degree, probably because of the 
      multifactorial influences of IPF on physical and mental health. The probability 
      of poor CPAP compliance was high and could only be eliminated with intense 
      follow-up by the CPAP clinic staff.
