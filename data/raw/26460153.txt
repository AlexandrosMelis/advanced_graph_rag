TI  - Cardiac reoperations in octogenarians: Do they really benefit?

AB  - AIM: According to the demographic development of our society, the numbers of 
      octogenarians referred to cardiac surgery are continuously growing. Although the 
      benefit of first-time cardiac procedures for these patients is well documented, 
      the fate of octogenarians after redo-procedures, with special regard to long-term 
      survival, functional status and quality of life, is poorly investigated. METHODS: 
      We retrospectively identified 84 consecutive patients aged >/=80 years, who 
      underwent a cardiac reoperation at the department for Cardiothoracic Surgery in 
      the Heart & Vessel Center Bad Bevensen between January 2007 and 2013. Demographic 
      profiles as well as operative data were analyzed, and the patients were 
      prospectively followed. Patient's functional status and quality of life were 
      assessed with the Barthel Index, New York Heart Association class and the short 
      form-12 questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age of the study group (61 men, 23 
      women) was 81.9 +/- 1.9 years. Most redo-procedures were carried out after primary 
      coronary artery bypass grafting (65%), primary aortic valve replacement (21%) and 
      primary mitral valve replacement (6%). The most frequent actual surgical 
      procedures were combined coronary artery bypass grafting and aortic valve 
      replacement (26%), isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (19%), and isolated 
      aortic valve replacement (19%). The mean length of hospital stay was 17 +/- 15 
      days. In-hospital mortality counted for 32.1%. During follow up (29 +/- 20 months) 
      a further 19.0% of the patients died. The Barthel Index of the survivors was 
      89 +/- 17 and their mean New York Heart Association class was 2 +/- 1. A total of 93% 
      of the patients were living at home. Summary scores of physical and mental health 
      of the short form-12 questionnaire equalled those of an age- and sex-matched 
      normative population. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high perioperative mortality, results 
      document a sustainable recovery of the survivors offering the prospect of a 
      highly independent and satisfying life. Therefore, advanced age alone should not 
      be a contraindication for redo cardiac interventions. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016;
