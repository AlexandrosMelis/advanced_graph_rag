TI  - Is fetal gender associated with emergency department visits for asthma during 
      pregnancy?
PG  - 293-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate if fetal gender (1) affects the risk of having an 
      emergency department (ED) visit for asthma; and (2) is associated with adverse 
      pregnancy outcomes among women who had at least one visit to the ED for asthma 
      during pregnancy. METHODS: We linked two provincial administrative databases 
      containing records on in-patient deliveries and ED visits. The study sample 
      included women who delivered a live singleton baby between April 2003 and March 
      2004. Pregnant women who made at least one ED visit for asthma were counted as 
      cases and the rest of the women as control subjects. We performed a multivariable 
      analysis using logistic regression to model the risk of having an ED visit for 
      asthma, with fetal gender being one of the predictors. In addition, a series of 
      multivariable logistic regressions were also constructed separately for cases and 
      controls for the following adverse delivery outcomes: low birth weight baby, 
      preterm delivery, and delivery via Caesarian section. RESULTS: Among 109,173 live 
      singleton deliveries, 530 women had visited ED due to asthma during pregnancy. 
      While having an ED visit for asthma was positively associated with teenage 
      pregnancy, low income, and presence of pregnancy-induced hypertension, it was not 
      associated with fetal gender (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.19). Fetal gender was not a 
      significant predictor of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma 
      ED visit during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Fetal gender does not affect the risk of 
      having an ED visit for asthma during pregnancy, and it is not associated with 
      adverse pregnancy outcomes among women who had an asthma-related ED during 
      pregnancy.
