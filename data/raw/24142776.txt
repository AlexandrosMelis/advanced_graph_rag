TI  - Steroids in aminoglycoside-containing ear drops: do they reduce cochlear 
      toxicity?

AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine whether betamethasone (BM) reduces the 
      cochlear toxicity of otic gentamicin (GM) if given together. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Controlled animal study. METHODS: Thirty-four mice were assigned at random to 
      receive intratympanic injections of either 0.1 % BM (11 mice), 0.3% GM (13 mice), 
      or a combination of both (GM/BM) with benzalkonium chloride (10 mice) in the left 
      ear (treated) and saline on the right (untreated). Six injections were given on 
      alternate days. Auditory brainstem response thresholds were assessed at 1 month, 
      2 months, and >2 months. RESULTS: There was a significantly greater degree of 
      hearing loss in the BM-treated ears compared to the untreated ears (6.48 dB 
      hearing loss, P = .007) and in the GM-treated ears compared to untreated ears 
      (6.59 dB hearing loss, P = .010,). However, otic GM/BM and benzalkonium chloride 
      did not cause significant additional hearing loss compared with the untreated 
      ears (3.56 dB hearing loss, P = .242). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that hearing 
      loss caused by GM otic drops may be reduced by the inclusion of BM and 
      benzalkonium chloride. Our finding that BM alone was associated with hearing loss 
      suggests that the benzalkonium chloride may be the protective agent in 
      combination otic drops.
