PG  - 232-8

AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study is aimed to assess the relationship between the 
      'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion and 
      suicide mortality in Europe. METHODS: Suicide rates for 26 countries were 
      obtained from the WHO. Data on social expenditure were obtained from the OECD 
      database. Employment rates and GDP were obtained from the Total Economy Database. 
      Questions about citizens' attitudes towards different aspects of social exclusion 
      were taken from the European Social Survey. Structural equation modelling was 
      applied to research the theoretical structure of the variables. RESULTS: All 
      variables are statistically significant in male and female models except of the 
      relationships between 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions and 
      female suicides; and the relationship between 'employment rates' and 
      'economic/employment' dimension. Suicide mortality rates among both males and 
      females are influenced negatively by 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' 
      dimensions. Among females, the influence of 'social/welfare' dimension is 
      stronger compared to the 'economic/employment' dimension. The remaining influence 
      of GDP is positive in both models. CONCLUSIONS: Both 'economic/employment' and 
      'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion significantly influence suicide 
      mortality among males. The influence of 'economic/employment' and 
      'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion on female suicide mortality is 
      controversial. Social exclusion might be considered as a risk factor for suicide 
      mortality in Europe.
