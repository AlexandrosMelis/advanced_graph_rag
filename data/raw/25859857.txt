AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on topographical 
      distribution patterns of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer was unknown. 
      METHODS: Patients with FIGO stage IB1-IIB who underwent radical surgery with or 
      without NACT were enrolled (3527 patients). A matched-case comparison design was 
      used to compare the effects of NACT on lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: We 
      analyzed groups of 167 and 140 patients who were diagnosed with lymph node 
      metastasis in the matched primary surgery group and NACT group, respectively, and 
      no significant difference was observed (p = 0.081). The incidence of lymph node 
      metastasis was significantly decreased in the NACT-responsive group compared to 
      the non-responsive group (18.4% vs. 38.6%, P<0.001). The metastatic rates for 
      every lymph node group also declined in the NACT-responsive group except for the 
      deep inguinal and the para-aortic lymph node groups. Clinical response, deep 
      stromal, parametrial and lymph vascular invasions were independent risk factors 
      for lymph node metastasis in the NACT group. Furthermore, deep stromal invasion 
      and lymph vascular invasion, but not the response to NACT, were independently 
      associated with upper LNM. The number of lymph nodes involved, response to NACT, 
      tumor histology and a positive vaginal margin were independent prognostic factors 
      affecting DFS or OS rates in node-positive patients treated with NACT plus 
      radical surgery. CONCLUSION: The frequency and topographic distribution of LNM 
      are not modified by NACT, and clinical non-responders showed more involved LNs. A 
      systemic and extensive lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients treated 
      with NACT plus surgery regardless of the response to NACT.
