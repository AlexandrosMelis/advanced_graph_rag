AB  - BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia patients are typically found to have low IQ both pre- 
      and post-onset, in comparison to the general population. However, a subgroup of 
      patients displays above average IQ pre-onset. The nature of these patients' 
      illness and its relationship to typical schizophrenia is not well understood. The 
      current study sought to investigate the symptom profile of high-IQ schizophrenia 
      patients. METHODS: We identified 29 schizophrenia patients of exceptionally high 
      pre-morbid intelligence (mean estimated pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ) of 
      120), of whom around half also showed minimal decline (less than 10 IQ points) 
      from their estimated pre-morbid IQ. We compared their symptom scores (SAPS, SANS, 
      OPCRIT, MADRS, GAF, SAI-E) with a comparison group of schizophrenia patients of 
      typical IQ using multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: The patients with very 
      high pre-morbid IQ had significantly lower scores on negative and disorganised 
      symptoms than typical patients (RRR=0.019; 95% CI=0.001, 0.675, P=0.030), and 
      showed better global functioning and insight (RRR=1.082; 95% CI=1.020, 1.148; 
      P=0.009). Those with a minimal post-onset IQ decline also showed higher levels of 
      manic symptoms (RRR=8.213; 95% CI=1.042, 64.750, P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia 
      that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical 
      schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum 
      over boundaried diagnostic categories.
