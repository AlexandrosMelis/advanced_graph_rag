TI  - Does pain intensity predict a poor opioid response in cancer patients?

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that initial pain intensity 
      is not a predictive factor of poor opioid response in advanced cancer patients, 
      as suggested by a recent work. METHODS: A secondary analysis of 
      one-hundred-sixty-seven patients referred for treatment of cancer-related pain 
      was conducted. Pain intensity at admission was recorded and patients were divided 
      in three categories of pain intensity: mild, moderate and severe. Patients were 
      offered a treatment with opioid dose titration, according to department policy. 
      Data regarding opioid doses and pain intensity were collected after dose 
      titration was completed. Four levels of opioid response were considered: (a) good 
      pain control, with minimal opioid escalation and without relevant adverse 
      effects; (b) good pain control requiring more aggressive opioid escalation, for 
      example doubling the doses in four days; (c) adequate pain control associated 
      with the occurrence of adverse effects; (d) poor pain control with adverse 
      effects. RESULTS: Seventy-six, forty-four, forty-one and six patients showed a 
      response a, b, c, and d, respectively. No correlation between baseline pain 
      intensity categories and opioid response was found. Patients with response 'b' 
      and 'd' showed higher values of OEImg. CONCLUSION: Baseline pain intensity does 
      not predict the outcome after an appropriate opioid titration. It is likely that 
      non-homogeneous pain treatment would have biased the outcome of a previous work.
