TI  - Injury and poisoning mortality among young men--are there any common factors 
      amenable to prevention?
PG  - 122-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Deaths from injury and poisoning (suicide, accidents, undetermined 
      deaths, and homicide) are the major cause of death among young men aged 15-39 
      years in England and Wales and have been increasing in recent years. AIM: To 
      describe common characteristics among young men who die from injury and 
      poisoning. DESIGN: We employed a retrospective survey methodology to investigate 
      factors associated with deaths by injury and poisoning among young men aged 15-39 
      years (n = 268) in Merseyside and Cheshire during 1995. Data were collected from 
      Coroner's inquest notes and General Practitioner records. MAIN RESULTS: The most 
      common cause of death was poisoning by alcohol and drugs (29.1%, n = 78). A high 
      proportion of cases were unemployed (39.4%, n = 106). Cases were also more likely 
      to be single compared to the general population (74.2% vs 55.5%). 
      Self-destructive behaviour was evident in 77% of deaths (n = 206). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Alcohol and drug use are important contributory factors to injury and poisoning 
      deaths. More research is needed into the effects of unemployment and being single 
      on the health of young men, and to investigate the motivations behind risk taking 
      and self-destructive behaviour.
