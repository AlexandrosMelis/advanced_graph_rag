TI  - Are patients with Werlhof's disease at increased risk for bleeding complications 
      when undergoing cardiac surgery?
PG  - 353-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is generally assumed, that patients with Werlhof's disease (WD) 
      are at increased risk for bleeding complications when undergoing cardiac surgery 
      with extracorporeal circulation. Therefore we performed this case control study 
      to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients. METHODS: 
      Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) 
      underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five 
      of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by 
      immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients 
      without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number 
      of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria. RESULTS: Mean 
      number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the 
      no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after 
      immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018). On the day before, directly 
      after and on the first day after surgery they were 141/nl vs. 215/nl (P=0.012), 
      75/nl vs. 147/nl (P=0.001) and 93/nl vs. 136/nl (P=0.009). Accordingly, patients 
      of the WD-group received significantly more platelet concentrates than patients 
      of the no-WD-group (mean number of platelet concentrates: 2.3 versus 0.7, 
      P=0.007). Total drainage loss via the mediastinal chest tubes was almost 
      identical (1197 ml in the no-WD-group and 1140 ml in the WD-group). One patient 
      of each group suffered from a bleeding complication requiring reexploration. 
      Three patients of the no-WD-group (6%) and one patient of the WD-group (10%) 
      expired postoperatively unrelated to WD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with WD may 
      possibly undergo cardiac surgery without a markedly enhanced risk for bleeding 
      complications despite a more than usual transfusion requirement and significantly 
      lower platelet counts perioperatively.
