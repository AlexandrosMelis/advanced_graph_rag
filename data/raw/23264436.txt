      experts' recommendations implemented in routine clinical practice?

AB  - BACKGROUND: A 2008 expert consensus statement outlined the minimum frequency of 
      follow-up of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). 
      METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 38 055 Medicare beneficiaries who received a new 
      CIED between January 1, 2005, and June 30, 2009. The main outcome measure was 
      variation of follow-up by patient factors and year of device implantation. We 
      determined the number of patients who were eligible for and attended an in-person 
      CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks, 0 to 16 weeks, and 1 year after 
      implantation. Among eligible patients, 42.4% had an initial in-person visit 
      within 2 to 12 weeks. This visit was significantly more common among white 
      patients than black patients and patients of other races (43.0% versus 36.8% 
      versus 40.5%; P<0.001). Follow-up within 2 to 12 weeks improved from 40.3% in 
      2005 to 55.1% in 2009 (P<0.001 for trend). The rate of follow-up within 0 to 16 
      weeks was 65.1% and improved considerably from 2005 to 2009 (62.3%-79.6%; P<0.001 
      for trend). Within 1 year, 78.0% of the overall population had at least 1 
      in-person CIED follow-up visit. CONCLUSIONS: Although most Medicare beneficiaries 
      who received a new CIED between 2005 and 2009 did not have an initial in-person 
      CIED follow-up visit within 2 to 12 weeks after device implantation, the rate of 
      initial follow-up improved appreciably over time. This CIED follow-up visit was 
      significantly more common in white patients than in patients of other races.
