AB  - INTRODUCTION: As with some procedures, trauma fellowship training and greater 
      surgeon experience may result in better outcomes following intramedullary nailing 
      (IMN) of diaphyseal femur fractures. However, surgeons with such training and 
      experience may not always be available to all patients. The purpose of this study 
      is to determine whether trauma training affects the post-operative difference in 
      femoral version (DFV) following IMN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 
      2009, 417 consecutive patients with diaphyseal femur fractures (AO/OTA 32A-C) 
      were treated via IMN. Inclusion criteria for this study included complete 
      baseline and demographic documentation as well as pre-operative films for 
      fracture classification and post-operative CT scanogram (per institutional 
      protocol) for version and length measurement of both the nailed and uninjured 
      femurs. Exclusion criteria included bilateral injuries, multiple ipsilateral 
      lower extremity fractures, previous injury, and previous deformity. Of the 
      initial 417 subjects, 355 patients met our inclusion criteria. Other data 
      included in our analysis were age, sex, injury mechanism, open vs. closed 
      fracture, daytime vs. nighttime surgery, mechanism of injury, and AO and Winquist 
      classifications. Post-operative femoral version of both lower extremities was 
      measured on CT scanogram by an orthopaedic trauma fellowship trained surgeon. 
      Standard univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine 
      statistically significant risk factors for malrotation between the two cohorts. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 80.3% (288/355) of all fractures were fixed by trauma-trained 
      surgeons. The mean post-operative DFV was 8.7 degrees  in these patients, compared to 
      10.7 degrees  in those treated by surgeons of other subspecialties. This difference was 
      not statistically significant when accounting for other factors in a multivariate 
      model (p>0.05). The same statistical trend was true when analyzing outcomes of 
      only the more severe Winquist type III and IV fractures. Additionally, surgeon 
      experience was not significantly predictive of post-operative version for either 
      trauma or non-trauma surgeons (p>0.05 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative 
      version or percentage of DFV >15 degrees  did not significantly differ following IMN of 
      diaphyseal femur fractures between surgeons with and without trauma fellowship 
      training. However, prospective data that removes the inherent bias that the more 
      complex cases are left for the traumatologists are required before a definitive 
      comparison is made.
