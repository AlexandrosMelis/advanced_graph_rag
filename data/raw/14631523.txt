TI  - Sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytoma: is it clinically 
      meaningful?
PG  - 729-35
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to identify prognostic factors for the survival 
      of children with cerebellar astrocytoma, and to evaluate the reproducibility and 
      prognostic value of histological sub-classification and grading. METHODS: 
      Children aged 0-14 years treated in Denmark for a cerebellar astrocytoma in the 
      period 1960-1984 were included and followed until January 2001 or until their 
      death. The histological specimens from each patient were reviewed for revised 
      grading and classification according to three different classification schemes: 
      the WHO, the Kernohan and the Daumas-Duport grading systems. RESULTS: The overall 
      survival rate was 81% after a follow-up time of 15-40 years. The significant 
      positive prognostic factors for survival were "surgically gross-total removal" of 
      the tumour at surgery and location of the tumour in the cerebellum proper as 
      opposed to location in the fourth ventricle. No difference in survival time was 
      demonstrated when we compared pilocytic astrocytoma and fibrillary astrocytoma. 
      Moreover, we found that the Kernohan and the WHO classification systems had no 
      predictive value and that the Daumas-Duport system is unsuitable as a prognostic 
      tool for low-grade posterior fossa astrocytomas. CONCLUSION: Discordant 
      observations due to interobserver variability make histological 
      sub-classification of low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas in children insufficient 
      for predicting prognosis and biological behaviour. Similar survival rates in a 
      population of paediatric low-grade cerebellar astrocytomas of grades I and II 
      indicate that tumour grade has no prognostic significance within this group of 
      patients. "Surgically gross-total removal", especially if the tumour is located 
      in the fourth ventricle is of the highest importance for long-term survival. 
      Histological sub-classification of the tumours has no predictive value.
