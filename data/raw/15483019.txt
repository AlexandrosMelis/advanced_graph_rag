TI  - Is eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol a good prognostic factor for invasive 
      bladder cancer after radical cystectomy?
PG  - 4103-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether eligibility to an adjuvant chemotherapy protocol in 
      itself represents a good prognostic factor after radical cystectomy for bladder 
      cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between April 1984 and May 1989, our institution 
      entered 35 patients with invasive bladder cancer into the Swiss Group for 
      Clinical and Epidemiological Cancer Research (SAKK) study 09/84. They were 
      randomly assigned to either observation or three postoperative courses of 
      cisplatin monotherapy after cystectomy. This study had a negative result. The 
      outcome of these 35 patients (protocol group) was compared with an age- and 
      tumor-stage-matched cohort (matched group; n = 35) who also underwent cystectomy 
      during the same period, but were not entered into the SAKK study, as well as the 
      remaining 57 patients treated during the study period for the same indication 
      (remaining group). RESULTS: Median overall survival decreased from 76.3 months in 
      the protocol group to 52.1 months in the matched group and to 20.3 months in the 
      remaining group. The respective times of median recurrence-free survival were 
      67.2, 16.0, and 9.4 months. Tumor progression occurred in 46% of the protocol 
      group compared with 69% in the matched group and 65% in the remaining group (P < 
      .05). Cancer-related death was noted in 40% of the protocol group, 57% in the 
      matched group, and 56% in the remaining group. CONCLUSION: These data suggest 
      that being willing and fit enough for a chemotherapy protocol is a good 
      prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer. This eligibility bias emphasizes 
      the need for prospective, randomized trials, and indicates that single-group 
      studies using historical or matched controls have to be interpreted with caution.
