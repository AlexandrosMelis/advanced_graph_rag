TI  - Is laparoscopic sonography a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging 
      colorectal cancer? A comparative study.
PG  - 1236-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colectomy has developed rapidly with the explosion of 
      technology. In most cases, laparoscopic resection is performed for colorectal 
      cancer. Intraoperative staging during laparoscopic procedure is limited. 
      Laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) represents the only real alternative to manual 
      palpation during laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: We evaluated the diagnostic 
      accuracy of LUS in comparison with preoperative staging and laparoscopy in 33 
      patients with colorectal cancer. Preoperative staging included abdominal US, CT, 
      and endoscopic US (for rectal cancer). Laparoscopy and LUS were performed in all 
      cases. Pre- and intraoperative staging were related to definitive histology. 
      Staging was done according to the TNM classification. RESULTS: LUS obtained good 
      results in the evaluation of hepatic metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% 
      versus 62.5% and 75% by preoperative diagnostic means and laparoscopy, 
      respectively. Nodal metastases were diagnosed with a sensitivity of 94% versus 
      18% with preoperative staging and 6% with laparoscopy, but the method had a low 
      specificity (53%). The therapeutic program was changed thanks to laparoscopy and 
      LUS in 11 cases (33%). In four cases (12%), the planned therapeutic approach was 
      changed after LUS alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study 
      demonstrate that LUS is an accurate and highly sensitive procedure in staging 
      colorectal cancer, providing a useful and reliable diagnostic tool complementary 
      to laparoscopy.
