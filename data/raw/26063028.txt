TI  - Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy in portal hypertension: 
      safe and effective?
PG  - 276-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage is a life-threatening 
      complication of portal hypertension. In this study, we compared the therapeutic 
      effect of a novel surgical procedure, esophagogastric devascularization without 
      splenectomy (EDWS), with the widely used modified esophagogastric 
      devascularization (MED) with splenectomy for the treatment of portal 
      hypertension. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with portal hypertension were included 
      in this retrospective study. Among them, 27 patients underwent EDWS, and the 
      other 28 patients underwent MED. Patients' characteristics, perioperative 
      parameters and long-term follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS: The portal venous 
      pressure was decreased by 20% postoperatively in both groups. The morbidity rate 
      of portal venous system thrombosis in the EDWS group was significantly lower than 
      that in the MED group (P=0.032). The 1- and 3-year recurrence rates of 
      esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage were 0% and 4.5% in the EDWS group, and 0% 
      and 8.7% in the MED group, respectively (P=0.631). CONCLUSIONS: EDWS is a safe 
      and effective treatment for esophagogastric varices secondary to portal 
      hypertension in selected patients. Patients treated with EDWS had a lower 
      complication rate of portal venous system thrombosis compared with those treated 
      with conventional MED.
