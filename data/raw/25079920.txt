AB  - OBJECTIVES: As parents of young children are often unaware their child is 
      overweight, screening provides the opportunity to inform parents and provide the 
      impetus for behaviour change. We aimed to determine if parents could recall and 
      understand the information they received about their overweight child after 
      weight screening. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial of different methods of 
      feedback. SETTING: Participants were recruited through primary and secondary care 
      but appointments took place at a University research clinic. PARTICIPANTS AND 
      INTERVENTION: 1093 children aged 4-8 years were screened. Only overweight 
      children (n=271, 24.7%) are included in this study. Parents of overweight 
      children were randomised to receive feedback regarding their child's weight using 
      best practice care (BPC) or motivational interviewing (MI) at face-to-face 
      interviews typically lasting 20-40 min. 244 (90%) parents participated in a 
      follow-up interview 2 weeks later to assess recall and understanding of 
      information from the feedback session. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Interviews were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim before coding for amount and 
      accuracy of recall. Scores were calculated for total recall and sub-categories of 
      interest. RESULTS: Overall, 39% of the information was recalled (mean score 6.3 
      from possible score of 16). Parents given feedback via BPC recalled more than 
      those in the MI group (difference in total score 0.48; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.92). 
      Although 94% of parents were able to correctly recall their child's weight 
      status, fewer than 10 parents could accurately describe what the measurements 
      meant. Maternal education (0.81; 0.25 to 1.37) and parental ratings of how useful 
      they found the information (0.19; 0.04 to 0.35) were significant predictors of 
      recall score in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: While parents remember that 
      their child's body mass index is higher than recommended, they are unable to 
      remember much of the information and advice provided about the result. TRIAL
