TI  - Pituitary apoplexy: do histological features influence the clinical presentation 
      and outcome?
PG  - 931-7
AB  - OBJECT: A retrospective analysis of a contemporary series of patients with 
      pituitary apoplexy was performed to ascertain whether the histopathological 
      features influence the clinical presentation or the outcome. METHODS: A 
      retrospective analysis was performed in 59 patients treated for pituitary 
      apoplexy at the University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia, 
      or Groote Schuur Hospital, University of Cape Town, South Africa. The patients 
      were divided into two groups according to the histological features of their 
      disease: one group with infarction alone, comprising 22 patients; and the other 
      with hemorrhagic infarction and/or frank hemorrhage, comprising 37 patients. The 
      presenting symptoms, clinical features, endocrinological status, and outcome were 
      compared between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The patients who presented with 
      histological features of pituitary tumor infarction alone had less severe 
      clinical features on presentation, a longer course prior to presentation, and a 
      better outcome than those presenting with hemorrhagic infarction or frank 
      hemorrhage. The endocrine replacement requirements were similar in both groups.
