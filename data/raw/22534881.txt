AB  - PURPOSE: The correlation between radiographic transition zone on contrast enema 
      in Hirschsprung's disease and the total length of aganglionosis is known to be 
      inaccurate. The aim of our study was to analyse this correlation more precisely 
      to improve preoperative planning of the corrective surgery. METHODS: From 1998 to 
      2009, 79 patients were operated on for Hirschsprung's disease. All available 
      preoperative contrast enemas (n = 61) had been single blind reviewed by the same 
      radiologist who defined the radiographic transition zone when present in 
      vertebral level. Four groups were determined (rectal, rectosigmoid, long segment, 
      and absence of transition zone) and by Kappa coefficient of agreement correlated 
      to the length of aganglionosis in the pathological report. RESULTS: Radiological 
      findings were concordant with the specimen in pathology in 8 cases of 19 in 
      rectal form (42 %), in 20 cases of 35 in rectosigmoid form (57 %), in all 6 cases 
      of long-segment form (100 %), in the 2 cases of total colonic form (100 %) with a 
      global agreement of 58.1 %, kappa = 0.39 CI [0.24; 0.57]. CONCLUSION: Correlation 
      between level of radiographic transition zone on contrast enema and length of 
      aganglionosis remains low. Systematic preoperative biopsy by coelioscopy or 
      ombilical incision is mandatory.
