TI  - Informed consent for total hip arthroplasty: does a written information sheet 
      improve recall by patients?
PG  - 404-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether a written information sheet is acceptable to 
      patients and improves recall of the consent interview. DESIGN: Prospective 
      randomised controlled study using questionnaires, comparing a group of patients 
      given information in a written sheet with appropriate explanation to a group 
      given verbal information alone. SETTING: A specialist orthopaedic surgery unit. 
      PATIENTS: The test group was 126 patients undergoing revision or primary total 
      hip arthroplasty; 65 patients were given information verbally, 61 patients were 
      given written information. OUTCOME MEASURE: Patients' recall of information 
      given, tested with a questionnaire completed on admission (mean of 18 days 
      later). RESULTS: The patients receiving written information scored significantly 
      higher (48% correct answers) than the patients receiving verbal information (38% 
      correct answers). CONCLUSIONS: Written information sheets contribute to the 
      process of informed consent. As patients' recall of information is generally 
      poor, the sheets may also be useful medicolegally, as a permanent record of what 
      was discussed.
