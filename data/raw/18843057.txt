AB  - OBJECTIVES: One of the problems with manual resuscitators is the difficulty in 
      achieving accurate volume delivery. The volume delivered to the patient varies by 
      the physical characteristics of the person and method. This study was designed to 
      compare tidal volumes delivered by the squeezing method, physical characteristics 
      and education and practice levels. METHODS: 114 individuals trained in basic life 
      support and bag-valve-mask ventilation participated in this study. Individual 
      characteristics were obtained by the observer and the education and practice 
      level were described by the subjects. Ventilation was delivered with a manual 
      resuscitator connected to a microspirometer and volumes were measured. Subjects 
      completed three procedures: one-handed, two-handed and two-handed 
      half-compression. RESULTS: The mean (standard deviation) volumes for the 
      one-handed method were 592.84 ml (SD 117.39), two-handed 644.24 ml (SD 144.7) and 
      two-handed half-compression 458.31 ml (SD 120.91) (p<0.01). Tidal volume 
      delivered by two hands was significantly greater than that delivered by one hand 
      (r = 0.398, p<0.01). The physical aspects including hand size, volume and grip 
      power had no correlation with the volume delivered. There were slight increases 
      in tidal volume with education and practice, but correlation was weak (r = 0.213, 
      r = 0.281, r = 0.131, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The tidal volume delivered by a 
      manual resuscitator shows large variations. There were significant differences in 
      the volume delivered by compression methods, but physical characteristics are not 
      a predictor of tidal volume delivery. The manual resuscitator is not a suitable 
      device for accurate ventilation.
