TI  - Treadmill testing of children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory: does peak 
      oxygen uptake reflect maximum oxygen uptake?
PG  - 679-87

AB  - BACKGROUND: Earlier studies have demonstrated low peak oxygen uptake 
      ((.)Vo(2)peak) in children with spina bifida. Low peak heart rate and low peak 
      respiratory exchange ratio in these studies raised questions regarding the true 
      maximal character of (.)Vo(2)peak values obtained with treadmill testing. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the Vo(2)peak measured 
      during an incremental treadmill test is a true reflection of the maximum oxygen 
      uptake ((.)Vo(2)max) in children who have spina bifida and are ambulatory. 
      DESIGN: A cross-sectional design was used for this study. METHODS: Twenty 
      children who had spina bifida and were ambulatory participated. The (.)Vo(2)peak 
      was measured during a graded treadmill exercise test. The validity of 
      (.)Vo(2)peak measurements was evaluated by use of previously described guidelines 
      for maximum exercise testing in children who are healthy, as well as differences 
      between Vo(2)peak and (.)Vo(2) during a supramaximal protocol 
      ((.)Vo(2)supramaximal). RESULTS: The average values for (.)Vo(2)peak and 
      normalized (.)Vo(2)peak were, respectively, 1.23 L/min (SD=0.6) and 34.1 
      mL/kg/min (SD=8.3). Fifteen children met at least 2 of the 3 previously described 
      criteria; one child failed to meet any criteria. Although there were no 
      significant differences between (.)Vo(2)peak and Vo(2)supramaximal, 5 children 
      did show improvement during supramaximal testing. LIMITATIONS: These results 
      apply to children who have spina bifida and are at least community ambulatory. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The (.)Vo(2)peak measured during an incremental treadmill test seems 
      to reflect the true (.)Vo(2)max in children who have spina bifida and are 
      ambulatory, validating the use of a treadmill test for these children. When 
      confirmation of maximal effort is needed, the addition of supramaximal testing of 
      children with disability is an easy and well-tolerated method.
