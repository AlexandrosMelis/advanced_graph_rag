TI  - Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in 
      improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits?
PG  - 35-43
AB  - CONTEXT: Severe upper gastrointestinal (GI) motor disorders, including 
      gastroparesis (GP), can consume significant health care resources. Many patients 
      are refractory to traditional drug therapy. OBJECTIVE: To compare symptoms, 
      healthcare resource utilization and costs in two groups of patients with the 
      symptoms of GP: those treated via gastric electrical stimulation (GES) and those 
      treated with traditional pharmacological agents in an intensive outpatient 
      program (MED). DESIGN: A long-term comparison of patients with devices (n = 9) vs 
      intensive medical therapy (n = 9). SETTING AND PATIENTS: A total of 18 eligible 
      patients with the symptoms of GP reported for 1-year baseline and long-term 
      treatment for 3 years. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with the symptoms of GP were 
      treated by a GES or intensive medical therapy (MED). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GP 
      Symptoms, healthcare resource utilization using investigator-derived independent 
      outcome measure score (IDIOMS) and total hospital (inpatient and outpatient) 
      billing costs. RESULTS: Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly different 
      from baseline (F = 3.03, P < 0.017) with GP patients treated via GES showing more 
      sustained improvement over 36 months than those treated via MED. Healthcare 
      resource usage, measured via the IDIOMS, significantly improved at 12, 24 and 36 
      month follow-up for GES patients (F = 10.49, P < 0.001), compared with patients 
      receiving medical therapy, who demonstrated further deterioration. GP patients 
      treated via GES also proved superior to medical therapy at 24 and 36 months with 
      regard to decreased costs (F = 4.85, P < 0.001). Within group comparisons 
      indicated significantly reduced hospital days for both patient groups; however, 
      no statistical differences were noted between groups in terms of hospital days. 
      Three of nine patients in the MED group died primarily from i.v. access related 
      problems; none of the GES patients died. CONCLUSION: We conclude that GES is more 
      effective in improving long-term GI symptoms and costs, and decreasing use of 
      healthcare resources than intensive medical therapy, in this sample of patients 
      with the symptoms of GP followed for 3 years. Certain patients with GP form a 
      high-risk group in terms of costs, quality of life, morbidity and mortality.
