TI  - Screening for gestational diabetes mellitus: are the criteria proposed by the 
      international association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups 
      cost-effective?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study 
      Groups (IADPSG) recently recommended new criteria for diagnosing gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study was undertaken to determine whether adopting 
      the IADPSG criteria would be cost-effective, compared with the current standard 
      of care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a decision analysis model 
      comparing the cost-utility of three strategies to identify GDM: 1) no screening, 
      2) current screening practice (1-h 50-g glucose challenge test between 24 and 28 
      weeks followed by 3-h 100-g glucose tolerance test when indicated), or 3) 
      screening practice proposed by the IADPSG. Assumptions included that 1) women 
      diagnosed with GDM received additional prenatal monitoring, mitigating the risks 
      of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia, and birth injury; and 2) GDM women had 
      opportunity for intensive postdelivery counseling and behavior modification to 
      reduce future diabetes risks. The primary outcome measure was the incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Our model demonstrates that the IADPSG 
      recommendations are cost-effective only when postdelivery care reduces diabetes 
      incidence. For every 100,000 women screened, 6,178 quality-adjusted life-years 
      (QALYs) are gained, at a cost of $125,633,826. The ICER for the IADPSG strategy 
      compared with the current standard was $20,336 per QALY gained. When postdelivery 
      care was not accomplished, the IADPSG strategy was no longer cost-effective. 
      These results were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The IADPSG 
      recommendation for glucose screening in pregnancy is cost-effective. The model is 
      most sensitive to the likelihood of preventing future diabetes in patients 
      identified with GDM using postdelivery counseling and intervention.
