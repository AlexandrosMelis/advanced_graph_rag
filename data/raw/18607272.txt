AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare children's, parents' and physicians' perceptions of 
      children's body size. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered a structured 
      questionnaire of body size perception using a descriptive Likert scale keyed to 
      body image figures to children ages 12 to 18 years. The same scale was given to 
      parents of children ages 5 to 18 years. The sample consisted of 91 children and 
      their parents being seen in the Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic for concerns 
      unrelated to overweight. Weight and height of the children were measured, and 
      body mass index (BMI) was calculated. The children's BMI percentiles were 
      categorized as underweight (<15th), normal (15th-85th), overweight (85th-95th), 
      and obese (95th and above). The attending physician independently completed the 
      body image and description scale and indicated the figure that most accurately 
      represented the patient without reference to BMI standards. Accuracy of the 
      patients', parents', and doctors' estimates were statistically compared. RESULTS: 
      The sample population consisted of 6.4% underweight, 70.5% normal weight, 7.7% 
      overweight, and 15.4% obese. Forty-four percent of parents underestimated 
      children's body size using word descriptions and 47% underestimated using 
      figures. Forty percent of the children underestimated their own body size using 
      descriptions and 43% underestimated using figures. The physicians in this study 
      had a higher percentage of correct estimates; however, they underestimated 33% of 
      the patients using both word descriptions and figures. Some obese children were 
      not recognized, and several average children were perceived as underweight. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Many children underestimated their degree of overweight. Their 
      parents and even their attending physicians shared this misperception. This study 
      demonstrates the need to further educate physicians to recognize obesity and 
      overweight so that they can counsel children and their families.
