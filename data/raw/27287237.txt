TI  - Assessment of appropriate antimicrobial prescribing: do experts agree?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the validity and reliability of expert 
      assessments of the quality of antimicrobial prescribing, despite their importance 
      in antimicrobial stewardship. We investigated how infectious disease doctors' 
      assessments compared with a reference standard (modal expert opinion) and with 
      the assessments of their colleagues. METHODS: Twenty-four doctors specialized in 
      infectious diseases or clinical microbiology (16 specialists and 8 residents) 
      from five hospitals were asked to assess the appropriateness of antimicrobial 
      agents prescribed for a broad spectrum of indications in 56 paper cases. They 
      were instructed how to handle guideline applicability and deviations. We created 
      a reference standard of antimicrobial appropriateness using the modal assessment 
      of 16 specialists. We calculated criterion validity and interrater and intrarater 
      overall and specific agreement with an index expert (senior infectious disease 
      physician) and analysed the influence of doctor characteristics on validity. 
      RESULTS: Specialists agreed with the reference standard in 80% of cases (range 
      75%-86%), with a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 84%, respectively. This 
      did not differ by clinical specialty, hospital or years of experience, and 
      residents had similar results. Specialists agreed with the index expert in 76% of 
      cases and the index expert agreed with his previous assessments in 71% of cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Doctors specialized in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology 
      assess the appropriateness of antimicrobials prescribed for a broad spectrum of 
      indications with acceptable agreement and validity, regardless of their 
      experience or hospital of employment. However, there is room for improvement, 
      which merits attention in multidisciplinary discussions and education.
