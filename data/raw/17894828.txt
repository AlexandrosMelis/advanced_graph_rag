TI  - Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme and frequency of severe hypoglycaemia in Type 
      1 diabetes: does a relationship exist?
PG  - 1449-54
AB  - AIMS: An association has been described between elevated serum 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and an increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia 
      (SH). To ascertain whether this reported association could be replicated in a 
      different country, it was re-examined in 300 individuals with Type 1 diabetes. 
      METHODS: People with Type 1 diabetes, none of whom was taking renin-angiotensin 
      system blocking drugs, were recruited. Participants recorded the frequency with 
      which they had experienced SH. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and serum ACE were 
      measured. The difference in the incidence of SH between different quartiles of 
      ACE activity and the relationship between serum ACE and SH were examined using 
      non-parametric statistical tests and a negative binomial model. RESULTS: Data 
      were obtained from 300 patients [158 male; HbA(1c) median (range) 8.2% 
      (5.2-12.8%), median age 36 years (16-88); duration of diabetes 14.5 years 
      (2-49)]. The incidence of SH was 0.93 episodes per patient year. The mean 
      incidence of SH in the top and bottom quartiles of ACE activity was 0.5 and 1.7 
      episodes per patient year, respectively, but this difference was not 
      statistically significant (P = 0.075). Spearman's test showed a very weak, 
      although statistically significant, association between serum ACE level and SH 
      incidence (r = 0.115, P = 0.047). The binomial model also showed a statistically 
      significant (P = 0.002), but clinically weak, relationship between serum ACE and 
      SH. CONCLUSIONS: The present survey showed a weak relationship between serum ACE 
      and the frequency of SH, the clinical relevance of which is unclear. This limits 
      the proposed role for serum ACE as an index of risk for SH.
