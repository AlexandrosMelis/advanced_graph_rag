AB  - BACKGROUND: CYP2D6 is an important cytochrome P450 enzyme. These enzymes catalyse 
      the oxidative biotransformation of about 25% of clinically important drugs as 
      well as the metabolism of numerous environmental chemical carcinogens. The most 
      frequent null allele of CYP2D6 in European populations, CYP2D6*4, has been 
      studied here in order to elucidate whether a relationship exists between this 
      allele and the risk of developing breast cancer in a Spanish population. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety-six breast cancer Spanish patients and one hundred 
      healthy female volunteers were genotyped for the CYP2D6*4 allele using AmpliChip 
      CYP450 Test technology. RESULTS: Homozygous CYP2D6*4 frequency was significant 
      lower in breast cancer patients than in the control group (OR=0.22, p=0.04). The 
      heterozygous CYP2D6*4 group also displayed lower values in patients than in 
      controls but the difference was not significant (OR=0.698, p=0.28). Therefore, 
      the presence of the CYP2D6*4 allele seems to decrease susceptibility to breast 
      carcinoma in the selected population. CONCLUSIONS: A possible decreased 
      transformation of procarcinogens by CYP2D6*4 poor metabolisers could result in a 
      protective effect against carcinogens.
