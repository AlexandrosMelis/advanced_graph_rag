TI  - Is irritable bowel syndrome a diagnosis of exclusion?: a survey of primary care 
      providers, gastroenterologists, and IBS experts.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Guidelines emphasize that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is not a 
      diagnosis of exclusion and encourage clinicians to make a positive diagnosis 
      using the Rome criteria alone. Yet many clinicians are concerned about 
      overlooking alternative diagnoses. We measured beliefs about whether IBS is a 
      diagnosis of exclusion, and measured testing proclivity between IBS experts and 
      community providers. METHODS: We developed a survey to measure decision-making in 
      two standardized patients with Rome III-positive IBS, including IBS with diarrhea 
      (D-IBS) and IBS with constipation (C-IBS). The survey elicited provider knowledge 
      and beliefs about IBS, including testing proclivity and beliefs regarding IBS as 
      a diagnosis of exclusion. We surveyed nurse practitioners, primary care 
      physicians, community gastroenterologists, and IBS experts. RESULTS: Experts were 
      less likely than nonexperts to endorse IBS as a diagnosis of exclusion (8 vs. 
      72%; P<0.0001). In the D-IBS vignette, experts were more likely to make a 
      positive diagnosis of IBS (67 vs. 38%; P<0.001), to perform fewer tests (2.0 vs. 
      4.1; P<0.01), and to expend less money on testing (US$297 vs. $658; P<0.01). 
      Providers who believed IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion ordered 1.6 more tests and 
      consumed $364 more than others (P<0.0001). Experts only rated celiac sprue 
      screening and complete blood count as appropriate in D-IBS; nonexperts rated most 
      tests as appropriate. Parallel results were found in the C-IBS vignette. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Most community providers believe IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion; 
      this belief is associated with increased resource use. Experts comply more 
      closely with guidelines to diagnose IBS with minimal testing. This disconnect 
      suggests that better implementation of guidelines is warranted to minimize 
      variation and improve cost-effectiveness of care.
