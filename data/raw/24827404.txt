      gastrectomy?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) was initially performed as the 
      first stage of biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch for the treatment 
      of super-obese or high-risk obese patients but is now most commonly performed as 
      a standalone operation. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate 
      outcomes after LSG according to resected stomach volume. METHODS: Between May 
      2011 and April 2013, LSG was performed in 102 consecutive patients undergoing 
      bariatric surgery. Two patients were excluded, and data from the remaining 100 
      patients were analyzed in this study. Patients were divided into three groups 
      according to the following resected stomach volume: 700-1,200 mL (group A, 
      n = 21), 1,200-1,700 mL (group B, n = 62), and >1,700 mL (group C, n = 17). Mean 
      values were compared among the groups by analysis of variance. RESULTS: The mean 
      percentage excess body weight loss (%EBWL) at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after 
      surgery was 37.68 +/- 10.97, 50.97 +/- 13.59, 62.35 +/- 11.31, and 67.59 +/- 9.02 %, 
      respectively. There were no significant differences in mean %EBWL among the three 
      groups. Resected stomach volume was greater in patients with higher preoperative 
      body mass index and was positively associated with resected stomach weight. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mean %EBWL after LSG was not significantly different among three 
      groups of patients divided according to resected stomach volume. Resected stomach 
      volume was significantly greater in patients with higher preoperative body mass 
      index.
