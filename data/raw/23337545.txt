AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a recently 
      described histologic pattern of diffuse pulmonary disease. In children, all cases 
      reported to date have been fatal. In this study, we describe the first nonfatal 
      AFOP in a child and review the literature. DESCRIPTION: A 10-year-old boy 
      developed very severe aplastic anemia (VSAA) after being admitted to our hospital 
      with a fulminant hepatic failure of unknown origin. A chest computed tomography 
      scan revealed multiple lung nodules and a biopsy of a pulmonary lesion showed all 
      the signs of AFOP. Infectious workup remained negative. We started 
      immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine to treat 
      VSAA. Subsequent chest computed tomography scans showed a considerable diminution 
      of the lung lesions but the VSAA did not improve until we performed hematopoietic 
      stem cell transplantation 5 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Aplastic anemia is 
      associated with a variety of autoimmune syndromes. The sequence of events in our 
      patient suggests that the hepatic failure, AFOP, and the VSAA may all have been 
      part of an autoimmune syndrome. AFOP could be the result of immune dysregulation 
      in this pediatric case with favorable outcome after immunosuppressive therapy and 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
