TI  - Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome?
PG  - 922-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reliable longitudinal data of patients with functional somatic 
      symptoms in general practice are lacking. AIMS: To identify distinctive features 
      in patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms, and to determine whether 
      these symptoms support the hypothesis of the existence of specific somatic 
      syndromes. DESIGN OF STUDY: Observational study, with a comparison control group. 
      SETTING: Four primary care practices affiliated with the University of Nijmegen 
      in the Netherlands. METHOD: One hundred and eighty-two patients diagnosed between 
      1998 and 2002 as having chronic functional somatic symptoms and 182 controls 
      matched by age, sex, socioeconomic status, and practice were included. Data on 
      comorbidity, referrals, diagnostic tests, and hospital admissions over a period 
      of 10 years prior to the diagnosis were collected. Medication use and number of 
      visits to the general practitioner (GP) were extracted from the moment 
      computerised registration was started. RESULTS: In the 10 years before the 
      diagnosis of chronic functional somatic symptoms, significantly more patients 
      than controls presented functional somatic symptoms in at least two body systems, 
      and used more somatic and psychotropic drugs. They visited the GP twice as much, 
      statistically had significantly more psychiatric morbidity, and were referred 
      more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. The number of 
      patients undergoing diagnostic tests was higher for patients with chronic 
      functional somatic symptoms than for controls, but hospital admissions rates were 
      equal. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms have a great 
      diversity of functional somatic symptoms. They use more somatic and psychotropic 
      drugs than controls in the years before diagnosis. Moreover, they show high rates 
      of referrals and psychiatric morbidity. The diversity of symptoms of patients 
      with chronic functional somatic symptoms supports the concept that symptoms do 
      not cluster in well defined distinct syndromes. Therefore, patients with chronic 
      functional somatic symptoms should preferably not be classified into medical 
      subspecialty syndromes.
