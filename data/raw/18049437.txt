TI  - Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis?
PG  - CR567-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory 
      demyelinating disease of uncertain etiology. Although the mechanisms of inducting 
      autoimmunity by some of the infectious agents have been investigated, there is 
      not yet enough research on streptococcal infections. MATERIAL/METHODS: To 
      understand the effect of past group A streptococcal infection on MS, 
      antistreptolysin O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) were measured in 
      21 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 21 healthy blood donors by 
      nephelometric assay. RESULTS: ADNase B levels in the patients with MS were found 
      to be significantly higher than in the controls (p<0.001); however, ASO levels 
      were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that a 
      relationship between multiple sclerosis and streptococcal infections may exist, 
      but to acquire a better understanding of the role of group A streptococci in the 
      pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis, more studies with animal models are 
      necessary.
