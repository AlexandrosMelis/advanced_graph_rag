TI  - Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Voluntary asphyxiation among children, preteens, and adolescents by 
      hanging or other means of inducing hypoxia/anoxia to enhance sexual excitement is 
      not uncommon and can lead to unintended death. This study addresses autoerotic 
      asphyxiation (AEA) with the intent of increasing pediatricians' knowledge of the 
      syndrome and awareness of its typical onset among young patients. AEA is 
      characteristically a clandestine and elusive practice. Provided with relevant 
      information, pediatricians can identify the syndrome, demonstrate a willingness 
      to discuss concerns about it, ameliorate distress, and possibly prevent a 
      tragedy. METHODS: A retrospective study was undertaken of published cases both 
      fatal and nonfatal and included personal communications, referenced citations, 
      clinical experience, and theoretical formulations as to causation. Characteristic 
      AEA manifestations, prevalence, age range, methods of inducing hypoxia/anoxia, 
      and gender weighting are presented. All sources were used as a basis for 
      additional considerations of etiology and possibilities for intervention. 
      RESULTS: AEA can be conceptualized as a personalized, ritualized, and symbolic 
      biopsychosocial drama. It seems to be a reenactment of intense emotional 
      feeling-states involving an identification and sadomasochistic relationship with 
      a female figure. Inept AEA practitioners can miscalculate the peril of the 
      situation that they have contrived and for numerous reasons lose their gamble 
      with death. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians should be alert to the earliest 
      manifestations of AEA. Awareness of choking games among the young and, of those, 
      a subset who eventually progress to potentially fatal AEA is strongly encouraged 
      among all primary care professionals who may be able to interrupt the behavior.
