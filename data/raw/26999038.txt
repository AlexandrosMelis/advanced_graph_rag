TI  - Could chest wall rigidity be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse?

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been a significant spike in fentanyl-related deaths from 
      illicit fentanyl supplied via the heroin trade. Past fentanyl access was 
      primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor 
      potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of 
      administration. Rapid intravenous (IV) fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity. 
      We evaluated post-mortem fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations in a recent 
      surge of lethal fentanyl intoxications. METHODS: Fentanyl related deaths from the 
      Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. 
      Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis 
      using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to 
      quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl. RESULTS: 48 fentanyl 
      deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5 ng/ml, (range 
      0.5 ng/ml to >40 ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9 ng/ml (range 
      none detected to 8.3 ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could 
      be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1 ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). 
      Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl 
      levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22 ng/ml 
      and 20 ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected. DISCUSSION: The lack of any 
      measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, 
      consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a 
      dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels 
      of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2 ng/ml) in apparent non-naive opiate 
      abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the 
      medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community. The average abuser 
      of illicit opioids may be unaware of the increasing fentanyl content of their 
      illicit opioid purchase. CONCLUSION: In summary we believe sudden onset chest 
      wall rigidity may be a significant and previously unreported factor leading to an 
      increased mortality, from illicit IV fentanyl use. Fentanyl and norfentanyl 
      ratios and concentrations suggest a more rapid onset of death given the finding 
      of fentanyl without norfentanyl in many of the fatalities. Chest wall rigidity 
      may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the 
      typical opioid-related overdose deaths. Intravenous heroin users should be 
      educated regarding this potentially fatal complication given the increasingly 
      common substitution and combination with heroin of fentanyl.
