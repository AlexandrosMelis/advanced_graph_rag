TI  - Is digoxin use for cardiovascular disease associated with risk of prostate 
      cancer?

AB  - PURPOSE: Digoxin is a commonly used medication for heart failure and cardiac 
      arrhythmias that has recently been suggested as a novel chemotherapeutic agent. 
      Preclinical studies of prostate cancer (PCa) have shown anti-tumor activity with 
      digoxin. We explore the relationship between use of digoxin and PCa risk. 
      METHODS: Data from a population-based case-control study of incident cases aged 
      35-74 years at PCa diagnosis in 2002-2005 in King County, Washington were 
      available. Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched 
      by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding 
      medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk 
      was evaluated with logistic regression. RESULTS: One thousand one cases of PCa 
      and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 
      2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age. In multivariate analysis 
      adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use 
      was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 
      0.30-1.10). Among those with >/=3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 
      380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk 
      (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98). CONCLUSION: These data indicate digoxin use may be 
      associated with a reduction in risk of PCa. Given the potential mechanisms by 
      which digoxin may exert an anti-neoplastic effect and other recent studies 
      showing a negative association between digoxin use and PCa, further research is 
      warranted.
