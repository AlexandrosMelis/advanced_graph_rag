TI  - Is intensive chemotherapy safe for rural cancer patients?

AB  - BACKGROUND: To provide equality of cancer care to rural patients, Townsville 
      Cancer Centre administers intensive chemotherapy regimens to rural patients with 
      node-positive breast and metastatic colorectal cancers at the same doses as urban 
      patients. Side-effects were usually managed by rural general practitioners 
      locally. AIM: The aim is to determine the safety of this practice by comparing 
      the profile of serious adverse events and dose intensities between urban and 
      rural patients at the Townsville Cancer Centre. METHOD: A retrospective audit was 
      conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal and node-positive breast cancers 
      during a 24-month period. Fisher's exact test was used for analysis. Rurality was 
      determined as per rural, remote and metropolitan classification. RESULTS: Of the 
      121 patients included, 70 and 51 patients had breast and colon cancers 
      respectively. The urban versus rural patient split among all patients, breast and 
      colorectal cancer subgroups was 68 versus 53, 43 versus 27 and 25 versus 26 
      respectively. A total of 421 cycles was given with dose intensity of >95% for 
      breast cancer in both groups (P > 0.05). Rate of febrile neutropenia was 9.3% 
      versus 7.4% (P = 0.56). For XELOX, rate of diarrhoea was 20% versus 19% (P = 
      0.66) and rate of vomiting was 20% versus 11% (P = 0.11). Only two patients were 
      transferred to Townsville for admission. No toxic death occurred in either group. 
      CONCLUSION: It appears safe to administer intensive chemotherapy regimens at 
      standard doses to rural patients without increased morbidity or mortality. 
      Support for general practitioners through phone or videoconferencing may reduce 
      the safety concerns.
