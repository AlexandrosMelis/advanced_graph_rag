TI  - Does fluoridation reduce the use of dental services among adults?
PG  - 454-71
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors determine whether prevention influences the use of health 
      services. Fluoridation's effect on restorative dental demand among 972 Washington 
      state employees and spouses, aged 20 to 34 years, in two fluoridated communities 
      and a nonfluoridated community was examined. METHODS: At baseline, adults were 
      interviewed by telephone, and oral assessments were conducted to measure personal 
      characteristics, lifetime exposure to fluoridated water, oral disease, and the 
      quality of restorations. Adults were followed for 2 years to measure dental 
      demand from dental claims. Each adult's baseline and claims data were linked with 
      provider and practice variables collected from the dentist who provided 
      treatment. RESULTS: Relative to adults with no lifetime exposure to fluoridated 
      water, adults drinking fluoridated water for half or more of their lives had less 
      disease at baseline and a lower but nonsignificant probability of receiving a 
      restoration in the follow-up period. In the 2-year follow-up period, however, 
      more than half of the restorations were performed to replace fillings of 
      satisfactory or ideal quality at baseline. When only teeth with decay and 
      unsatisfactory fillings at baseline were considered, adults with high 
      fluoridation exposure had a lower probability of receiving a restoration than 
      adults with no exposure. Market effects also were detected in demand equations; 
      relative to adults in the nonfluoridated community, adults residing in the 
      fluoridated community with a large dentist supply received a greater number of 
      restorations, suggesting potential supplier-induced demand from less disease and 
      fewer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Among adults aged 20 to 34 years with private dental 
      insurance, fluoridation reduces oral disease but may or may not reduce use of 
      restorative services, depending on dentists' clinical decisions.
