      hormonal differences responsible?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the gender dimorphism after injury with specific 
      reference to the reproductive age of the women (young, <48 yrs of age, vs. old, 
      >52 yrs of age) in a cohort of severely injured trauma patients for which 
      significant variation in postinjury care is minimized. DESIGN: Secondary data 
      analysis of an ongoing prospective multicenter cohort study. SETTING: Academic, 
      level I trauma and intensive care unit centers. PATIENTS: Blunt-injured adults 
      with hemorrhagic shock. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: 
      Separate Cox proportional hazard regression models were formulated based on all 
      patients to evaluate the effects of gender on mortality, multiple organ failure, 
      and nosocomial infection, after controlling for all important confounders. These 
      models were then used to characterize the effect of gender in young and old age 
      groups. Overall mortality, multiple organ failure, and nosocomial infection rates 
      for the entire cohort (n = 1,036) were 20%, 40%, and 45%, respectively. Mean 
      Injury Severity Score was 32 +/- 14 (mean +/- SD). Men (n = 680) and women (n = 
      356) were clinically similar except that men required higher crystalloid volumes, 
      more often had a history of alcoholism and liver disease, and had greater 
      ventilatory and intensive care unit requirements. Female gender was independently 
      associated with a 43% and 23% lower risk of multiple organ failure and nosocomial 
      infection, respectively. Gender remained an independent risk factor in young and 
      old subgroup analysis, with the protection afforded by female gender remaining 
      unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The independent protective effect of female gender on 
      multiple organ failure and nosocomial infection rates remains significant in both 
      premenopausal and postmenopausal women when compared with similarly aged men. 
      This is contrary to previous experimental studies and the known physiologic sex 
      hormone changes that occur after menopause in women. These results suggest that 
      factors other than sex hormones may be responsible for gender-based differences 
      after injury.
