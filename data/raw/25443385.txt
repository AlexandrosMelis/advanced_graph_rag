AB  - PURPOSE: Virtual planning and guided surgery with or without prebent or milled 
      plates are becoming more and more common for mandibular reconstruction with 
      fibular free flaps (FFFs). Although this excellent surgical option is being used 
      more widely, the question of the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide 
      production has to be discussed. In capped payment systems such additional costs 
      have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra 
      funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and 
      guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain 
      resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: All consecutive cases of FFF surgery were evaluated during a 2-year 
      period. Institutional data were used to determine the price of 1 minute of 
      operative time. The time for fibula molding, plate adaptation, and insetting was 
      recorded. RESULTS: During the defined period, we performed 20 mandibular 
      reconstructions using FFFs, 9 with virtual planning and guided surgery and 11 
      freehand cases. One minute of operative time was calculated to cost US $47.50. 
      Multiplying this number by the time saved, we found that the additional cost of 
      virtual planning was reduced from US $5,098 to US $1,231.50 with a prebent plate 
      and from US $6,980 to US $3,113.50 for a milled plate. CONCLUSIONS: Even in 
      capped health care systems, virtual planning and guided surgery including prebent 
      or milled plates are financially viable.
