AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, 
      but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when 
      part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to 
      form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended 
      similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity. 
      METHODS: We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two 
      different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP 
      unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor 
      and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to 
      reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in 
      patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit 
      was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods 
      were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: No statistically 
      significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP 
      doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the 
      mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous 
      performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P < 0.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 
      6.01 days (P = 0.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP 
      physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or 
      their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients 
      had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P < 0.001) 
      and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P < 0.001) than SP patients. 
      Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended 
      twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors. CONCLUSION: The EBP unit was 
      associated with better patient outcomes and more efficient performance than 
      achieved by the same physicians previously or by SP concurrently.
