TI  - Are financial incentives cost-effective to support smoking cessation during 
      pregnancy?

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of up to  pound400 worth of financial 
      incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy as an adjunct to routine health 
      care. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on a Phase II randomized 
      controlled trial (RCT) and a cost-utility analysis using a life-time Markov 
      model. SETTING: The RCT was undertaken in Glasgow, Scotland. The economic 
      analysis was undertaken from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. 
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 612 pregnant women randomized to receive usual cessation 
      support plus or minus financial incentives of up to  pound400 vouchers (US $609), 
      contingent upon smoking cessation. MEASUREMENTS: Comparison of usual support and 
      incentive interventions in terms of cotinine-validated quitters, quality-adjusted 
      life years (QALYs) and direct costs to the NHS. FINDINGS: The incremental cost 
      per quitter at 34-38 weeks pregnant was  pound1127 ($1716).This is similar to the 
      standard look-up value derived from Stapleton & West's published ICER tables, 
       pound1390 per quitter, by looking up the Cessation in Pregnancy Incentives Trial 
      (CIPT) incremental cost ( pound157) and incremental 6-month quit outcome (0.14). The 
      life-time model resulted in an incremental cost of  pound17 [95% confidence interval 
      (CI) = - pound93,  pound107] and a gain of 0.04 QALYs (95% CI = -0.058, 0.145), giving an 
      ICER of  pound482/QALY ($734/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates 
      uncertainty in these results, particularly regarding relapse after birth. The 
      expected value of perfect information was  pound30 million (at a willingness to pay of 
       pound30 000/QALY), so given current uncertainty, additional research is potentially 
      worthwhile. CONCLUSION: Financial incentives for smoking cessation in pregnancy 
      are highly cost-effective, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life 
      years of  pound482, which is well below recommended decision thresholds.
