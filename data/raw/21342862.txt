AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the construct validity of the Turkish version of the EQ-5D 
      in patients with acute coronary syndrome. METHODS: The study was conducted as a 
      cross-sectional study at the Trakya University Hospital between February and May 
      2008. All patients completed the Turkish version of the EQ-5D and MacNew 
      heart-related quality of life scale. Construct validity of the EQ-5D was assessed 
      according to relationships with MacNew subscales by using Spearman rank 
      correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: One hundred and 
      twenty-two patients responded to the instruments. Mean age was 62.9+/-9.3 years and 
      male gender (88 or 72.1%) was dominant. Mean score of the EQ-5D index was 
      0.79+/-0.32, while the global score of MacNew was 5.01+/-1.16. The correlation 
      coefficients of the EQ-5D index score with the MacNew subscales ranged from 0.557 
      to 0.721, with EQ-5D VAS score ranging from 0.297 to 0.484 (p<0.001 for all of 
      them). According to the stepwise regression model MacNew global score was found 
      to be significantly effective factor on EQ-5D index score (beta =0.188; 95% CI: 
      0.152-0.224; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of the EQ-5D-based utility 
      score seems to be a valid instrument in the assessment of quality of life studies 
      in patients with acute coronary syndrome.
