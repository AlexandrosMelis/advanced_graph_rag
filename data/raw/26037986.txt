      concern and need for improvement?

AB  - AIMS: Emergency surgery is associated with poorer outcomes and higher mortality 
      with recent studies suggesting the 30-day mortality to be 14-15%. The aim of this 
      study was to analyse the 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality and 
      1-year mortality following emergency laparotomy. We hope this will encourage 
      prospective data collection, improvement of care and initiate strategies to 
      establish best practice in this area. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 
      patients who underwent emergency laparotomy from June 2010 to May 2012. The 
      primary end point of the study was 30-day mortality, age-related 30-day mortality 
      and 1-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS: 477 laparotomies were performed in 446 
      patients. 57% were aged <70 and 43% aged >70 years. 30-day mortality was 12, 4% 
      in those aged <70 years and 22% in those >70 years (p < 0.001). 1-year mortality 
      was 25, 15% in those aged under 70 years and 38% in those aged >70 years (p < 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, 
      especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to 
      improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute 
      surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency 
      surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps 
      even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist 
      centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the 
      elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for 
      post-discharge care.
