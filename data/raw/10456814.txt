TI  - Does desflurane alter left ventricular function when used to control surgical 
      stimulation during aortic surgery?
PG  - 737-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although desflurane is commonly used to control surgically induced 
      hypertension, its effects on left ventricular (LV) function have not been 
      investigated in this clinical situation. The purpose of the present study was to 
      evaluate the LV function response to desflurane, when used to control 
      intraoperative hypertension. METHODS: In 50 patients, scheduled for vascular 
      surgery, anesthesia was induced with sufentanil 0.5 microg/kg, midazolam 0.3 
      mg/kg and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was 
      maintained with increments of drugs with controlled ventilation (N2O/O2=60/40%) 
      until the start of surgery. A 5 Mhz transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe 
      was inserted after intubation. Pulmonary artery catheter and TEE measurements 
      were obtained after induction (to)(control value), at surgical incision (t1) if 
      it was associated with an increase in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) greater 
      than 140 mmHg (hypertension) and after control of hemodynamic parameters by 
      administration of desflurane (return of systolic arterial pressure to within 20% 
      of the control value) (t2) in a fresh gas flow of 31/ min. RESULTS: Sixteen 
      patients developed hypertension at surgical incision. SAP was controlled by 
      desflurane in all 16 patients. Afterload assessed by systemic vascular resistance 
      index (SVRI), end-systolic wall-stress (ESWS) and left-ventricular stroke work 
      index (LVSWI) increased with incision until the hypertension returned to 
      post-induction values with mean end-tidal concentration of 5.1+/-0.7% desflurane. 
      No change in heart rate, cardiac index, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, stroke 
      volume, end-diastolic and end-systolic cross-sectional areas, fractional area 
      change and left ventricular circumferential fiber shortening was noted when 
      desflurane was added to restore blood pressure. CONCLUSION: This study 
      demonstrates that in patients at risk for cardiac morbidity undergoing vascular 
      surgery, desflurane is effective to control intraoperative hypertension without 
      fear of major cardiac depressant effect.
