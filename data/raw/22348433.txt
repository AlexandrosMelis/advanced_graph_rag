      two-stage breast reconstruction?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The optimum protocol for expander volume adjustment with respect to 
      the timing and application of radiotherapy remains controversial. METHODS: 
      Eighteen New Zealand rabbits were divided into three groups. Metallic port 
      integrated anatomic breast expanders of 250 cc were implanted on the back of each 
      animal and controlled expansion was performed. Group I underwent radiotherapy 
      with full expanders while in Group II, expanders were partially deflated 
      immediately prior to radiotherapy. Control group did not receive radiotherapy.The 
      changes in blood flow at different volume adjustments were investigated in Group 
      II by laser Doppler flowmetry. Variations in the histopathologic properties of 
      the irradiated tissues including the skin, capsule and the pocket floor, were 
      compared in the biopsy specimens taken from different locations in each group. 
      RESULTS: A significant increase in skin blood flow was detected in Group II with 
      partial expander deflation. Overall, histopathologic exam revealed aggravated 
      findings of chronic radiodermatitis (epidermal atrophy, dermal inflammation and 
      fibrosis, neovascularisation and vascular changes as well as increased capsule 
      thickness) especially around the lower expander pole, in Group II. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Expander deflation immediately prior to radiotherapy, may augment the adverse 
      effects, especially in the lower expander pole, possibly via enhanced 
      radiosensitization due to a relative increase in the blood flow and tissue 
      oxygenation.
