TI  - Chronic progressive cervical myelopathy with HTLV-I infection: Variant form of 
      HAM/TSP?
PG  - 1276-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of human T-lymphotrophic virus type I (HTLV-I) 
      infection in four patients who developed slowly progressive myelopathy with 
      abnormal MRI lesions in the cervical cord levels. METHODS: Clinical and 
      neuroradiologic examinations were performed, and the odds that an HTLV-I-infected 
      individual of specified genotype, age, and provirus load had HTLV-I-associated 
      myelopathy (HAM)/tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) were calculated. RESULTS: 
      Anti-HTLV-I antibodies were positive in both the serum and the CSF in all of the 
      patients. Biopsied sample from spinal cord lesions showed inflammatory changes in 
      Patient 1. Patient 2 had a demyelinating type of sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Two 
      of the three patients examined showed high risk of developing HAM/TSP in 
      virologic and immunologic aspects. CONCLUSION: These four cases may belong to a 
      variant form of HAM/TSP, predominantly involving the cervical cord levels.
