TI  - Estradiol and Antagonist Pretreatment Prior to Microdose Leuprolide in in Vitro 
      Fertilization. Does It Improve IVF Outcomes in Poor Responders as Compared to 
      Oral Contraceptive Pill?
PG  - 199-204
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes in low responders 
      stimulated with microdose leuprolide protocol (ML) following pretreatment with 
      either oral contraceptive pill (OCP) or luteal estradiol (E2) + GnRH antagonist 
      (E2 + antag) for follicular synchronization prior to controlled ovarian 
      hyperstimulation (COH). STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of 130 
      women, who were poor responders, undergoing IVF with either OCP/ML or E2+ 
      antag/ML protocols. The main outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rates, 
      number of oocytes retrieved, and cancellation rate. RESULTS: Both groups were 
      similar in baseline characteristics. There were no significant differences in 
      gonadotropin requirement, cancellation rate, and number of embryos transferred. 
      Ongoing pregnancy rates (40% vs. 15%) were significantly higher in the OCP/ML 
      group. Trends toward greater number of oocytes retrieved (7.7 +/- 3.4 vs. 5.9 +/- 
      4.2) and improved implantation rates (20% vs. 12%) were also noted, but these did 
      not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION: E2+antag pretreatment does not 
      appear to improve IVF outcomes in ML protocol when compared to the standard OCP 
      in poor responders. Randomized trials with adequate power to study the optimal 
      method of steroid pretreatments appear justified.
