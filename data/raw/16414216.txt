TI  - Are endometrial polyps from pre-menopausal women similar to post-menopausal 
      women? An immunohistochemical comparison of endometrial polyps from pre- and 
      post-menopausal women.
PG  - 277-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Do endometrial polyps from pre- and post-menopausal women have similar 
      immunohistochemical expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors (ER, PR) 
      and markers of cellular proliferation/apoptosis (Ki67 and Bcl-2). DESIGN: 
      Prospective cohort study. Non-parametric statistical analysis was used. SETTING: 
      Polyps recruited from women attending an out-patient hysteroscopy clinic in a UK 
      district general hospital. PATIENTS: Fourteen pre-menopausal and 16 
      post-menopausal women who presented with abnormal bleeding with endometrial 
      polyps. INTERVENTIONS: Immunohistochemical staining was performed on endometrial 
      polyps. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Significant differences or correlations between 
      hormone receptor expression (oestrogen and progesterone) and cell growth indices 
      (Ki67 and Bcl-2). RESULTS: Endometrial polyps from pre- and post-menopausal women 
      had significant differences in their expression of hormone receptors and Ki67. 
      However, polyps from both groups of women had similarly increased levels of 
      Bcl-2, an inhibitor of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and post-menopausal polyps 
      exhibit differing hormone receptor and proliferation markers, presumably a result 
      of their hormonal milieu. However, both groups appear to have lost the usual 
      control mechanisms for apoptotic regulation, this appears to be responsible for 
      their growth.
