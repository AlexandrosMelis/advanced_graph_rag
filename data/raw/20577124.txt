AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hyperleptinemia and oxidative stress play a major role in the 
      development of cardiovascular diseases in obesity. This study aimed to 
      investigate whether there is a relationship between plasma levels of leptin and 
      phagocytic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity, 
      and its potential relevance in the vascular remodeling in obese patients. 
      METHODS: The study was performed in 164 obese and 94 normal-weight individuals 
      (controls). NADPH oxidase activity was evaluated by luminescence in phagocytic 
      cells. Levels of leptin were quantified by ELISA in plasma samples. Carotid 
      intima-media thickness (cIMT) was measured by ultrasonography. In addition, we 
      performed in-vitro experiments in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 
      murine macrophages. RESULTS: Phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity and leptin levels 
      were enhanced (P < 0.05) in obese patients compared with controls. NADPH oxidase 
      activity positively correlated with leptin in obese patients. This association 
      remained significant in a multivariate analysis. cIMT was higher (P < 0.05) in 
      obese patients compared with controls. In addition, cIMT also correlated 
      positively with leptin and NADPH oxidase activity in obese patients. In-vitro 
      studies showed that leptin induced NADPH oxidase activation. Inhibition of the 
      leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activity by wortmannin and bisindolyl maleimide 
      suggested a direct involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein 
      kinase C pathways, respectively. Finally, leptin-induced NADPH oxidase activation 
      promoted macrophage proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that 
      phagocytic NADPH oxidase activity is increased in obesity and is related to 
      preclinical atherosclerosis in this condition. We also suggest that 
      hyperleptinemia may contribute to phagocytic NADPH oxidase overactivity in 
      obesity.
