TI  - Do communication disorders extend to musical messages? An answer from children 
      with hearing loss or autism spectrum disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Effective musical communication requires conveyance of the intended 
      message in a manner perceptible to the receiver. Communication disorders that 
      impair transmitting or decoding of structural features of music (e.g., pitch, 
      timbre) and/or symbolic representation may result in atypical musical 
      communication, which can have a negative impact on music therapy interventions. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study compared recognition of symbolic representation of emotions 
      or movements in music by two groups of children with different communicative 
      characteristics: severe to profound hearing loss (using cochlear implants [CI]) 
      and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Their responses were compared to those of 
      children with typical-development and normal hearing (TD-NH). Accuracy was 
      examined as a function of communicative status, emotional or movement category, 
      and individual characteristics. METHODS: Participants listened to recorded 
      musical excerpts conveying emotions or movements and matched them with labels. 
      Measures relevant to auditory and/or language function were also gathered. 
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the ASD and TD-NH groups in 
      identification of musical emotions or movements. However, the CI group was 
      significantly less accurate than the other two groups in identification of both 
      emotions and movements. Mixed effects logistic regression revealed different 
      patterns of accuracy for specific emotions as a function of group. CONCLUSION: 
      Conveyance of emotions or movements through music may be decoded differently by 
      persons with different types of communication disorders. Because music is the 
      primary therapeutic tool in music therapy sessions, clinicians should consider 
      these differential abilities when selecting music for clinical interventions 
      focusing on emotions or movement.
