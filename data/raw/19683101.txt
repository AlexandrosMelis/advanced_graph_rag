AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this study, we investigated D-dimer serum level as a diagnostic 
      parameter for acute appendicitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine patients were 
      enrolled in the study. Patients were classified according to age; sex; duration 
      between the beginning of pain and referral to a hospital or clinic; Alvarado 
      scores; and in physical examination, presence of muscular defense, the number of 
      leukocytes, preoperative ultrasonography, and D-dimer levels of histopathologic 
      study groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the patients enrolled in the study, 26.5% 
      were females and 73.5% males. The average age was 21 years (range, 16-38 years) 
      and 81.7% acute appendicitis (AA). According the duration of pain, 63.2% of the 
      patients were referred to the hospital within the first 24 hours, 26.5% of the 
      patients were referred to the hospital within 24 to 48 hours, and 10.3% were 
      referred to the hospital within a period of more than 48 hours. No statistically 
      significant difference was determined regarding D-dimer levels between the 
      histopathologic study groups (P > .05). Alvarado scores lower than 7 were found 
      in 36.7% and 7 or higher in 63.3% of the patients. There was no statistically 
      significant difference related with D-dimer levels between histopathologic study 
      groups (P > .05). The ratio of cases with a number of leukocytes below the upper 
      limit were determined respectively as 32.7% and 67.3%, and no statistically 
      significant difference was found regarding d-dimer levels between histopathologic 
      study groups (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Increased D-dimer levels should not be 
      considered as a diagnostic parameter in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
