TI  - Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke? A pilot 
      case-referent study.
PG  - 1112-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In primary and secondary prevention trials, statins have 
      been shown to reduce the risk of stroke. In addition to lipid lowering, statins 
      have a number of antiatherothrombotic and neuroprotective properties. In a 
      preliminary observational study, we explored whether clinical outcome is improved 
      in patients who are on treatment with statins when stroke occurs. METHODS: We 
      conducted a population-based case-referent study of 25- to 74-year-old stroke 
      patients with, for each case of a patient who was on statin treatment at the 
      onset of stroke (n=125), 2 referent patients who were not treated with statins 
      but were matched for age, gender, year of onset, and stroke subtype (n=250). 
      RESULTS: The unadjusted odds ratio for early discharge to home (versus late 
      discharge or death) was 1.41 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.17) when patients on statin 
      treatment were compared with referent stroke patients not on statins. Prognostic 
      factors were, in general, more unfavorable among patients on statins. When this 
      was adjusted for in a logistic regression model, the use of statins was a 
      moderately strong but statistically nonsignificant predictor of discharge to home 
      (multiple-adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.22). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      statistical power of this case-referent study was such that only large beneficial 
      effects of statins in acute stroke could be confirmed. However, the observed 
      trend, together with experimental observations, is interesting enough to warrant 
      a more detailed analysis of the relationship between statins and stroke outcome.
