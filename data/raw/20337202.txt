TI  - Continuation of pregnancy after antenatal corticosteroid administration: 
      opportunity for rescue?
PG  - 14-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the duration of continuing pregnancy after antenatal 
      corticosteroid (AC) administration and to evaluate the potential opportunity for 
      rescue AC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of women at 24-32 weeks' 
      gestation who received AC at one institution. RESULTS: Six hundred ninety-two 
      women received AC. Two hundred forty-seven (35.7%) delivered at > or = 34 weeks' 
      gestation. Three hundred twenty-one (46.4%) delivered within 1 week of AC; 92 of 
      those women (13.3%) delivered within 24 hours. Only 124 (17.9%) remained pregnant 
      1 week after AC and delivered at < 34 weeks. The latter were compared to women 
      delivering > 2 week after AC but > or = 34 weeks. More likely to deliver at < 34 
      weeks were those women who received AC for premature preterm rupture of membranes 
      (OR 3.83, 95% CI 2.06-7.17), twins (OR 2.90, 95% CI 1.42-5.95) or before 28 weeks 
      (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.38-3.52). CONCLUSION: Rescue AC may apply to only 18% of 
      cases, and we identified subsets of more likely candidates.
