AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently the choice of breast cancer therapy is based on prognostic 
      factors. The proliferation marker Ki-67 is used increasingly to determine the 
      method of therapy. The current study analyses the predictive value of Ki-67 in 
      foreseeing breast cancer patients' responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
      METHODS: This study includes patients with invasive breast cancer treated between 
      2008 and 2013. The clinical response was assessed by correlating Ki-67 to 
      histological examination, mammography, and ultrasonography findings. RESULTS: The 
      average Ki-67 value in our patients collectively (n = 77) is 34.9 +/- 24.6%. The 
      average Ki-67 value is the highest with 37.4 +/- 24.0% in patients with a pCR. The 
      Ki-67 values do not differ significantly among the 3 groups: pCR versus partial 
      pathological response versus stable disease/progress (P = 0.896). However, Ki-67 
      values of patients with luminal, Her2 enriched, and basal-like cancers differed 
      significantly from each other. Furthermore, within the group of luminal tumors 
      Ki-67 values of patients with versus without pCR also differed significantly. 
      CONCLUSION: Our data shows that the Ki-67 value predicts the response to 
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy as a function of the molecular subtype, reflecting the 
      daily routine concerning Ki-67 and its impressing potential and limitation as a 
      predictive marker for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response.
