AB  - AIM: A clinical study was done to assess the clinical diagnostic accuracy of cone 
      beam computed tomography (CBCT) in detecting proximal cavitated carious lesions 
      in order to determine whether cavitation should be reported when a CBCT 
      examination is available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 79 adjacent proximal surfaces 
      without restorations in permanent teeth were examined. Patients suspected to have 
      carious lesions after a visual clinical and a bitewing examination participated 
      in a CBCT examination (Kodak 9000 3D, 5 x 3.7 cm field of view, voxel size 0.07 
      mm). Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained according to the 
      Helsinki Declaration. Radiographic assessment recording lesions with or without 
      cavitation was performed by two observers in bitewings and CBCT sections. 
      Orthodontic separators were placed interdentally between two lesion-suspected 
      surfaces. The separator was removed after 3 days and the surfaces recorded as 
      cavitated (yes/no), i.e. validated clinically. Differences between the two 
      radiographic modalities (sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy) were 
      estimated by analyzing the binary data in a generalized linear model. RESULTS: 
      For both observers, sensitivity was significantly higher for CBCT than for 
      bitewings (average difference 33%, p < 0.001) while specificity was not 
      significantly different between the methods (p = 0.19). The overall accuracy was 
      also significantly higher for CBCT (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: CBCT was more 
      accurate in detecting cavitation in proximal surfaces than bitewing radiographs; 
      therefore a CBCT examination performed for other clinical applications should 
      also be assessed for proximal surface cavities in teeth without restorations, and 
      when detected, this pathology must be part of the dentist's report.
