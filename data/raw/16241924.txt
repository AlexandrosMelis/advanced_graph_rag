TI  - Does parity increase insulin resistance during pregnancy?
PG  - 1574-80
AB  - AIMS: To study the effect of parity on impairment of insulin sensitivity during 
      pregnancy and on the risk of gestational diabetes (GDM). METHODS: We studied the 
      relationship between parity and peripheral insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) 
      or GDM in 1880 caucasian women, who underwent a 100-g, 3-h oral glucose tolerance 
      test (OGTT) between the 24th and 28th gestational week and in 75 women who 
      underwent an OGTT in two consecutive pregnancies. A proxy for beta-cell function 
      (basal plasma C peptide/fasting plasma glucose; CP/FPG) was also measured. 
      RESULTS: By univariate analysis parity was related to decreased ISI(OGTT) and to 
      increased CP/FPG in those with parity > 3 and likewise GDM, diagnosed in 124 
      women (6.58%), was linearly related to parity (P = 0.0034) and strongly age 
      dependent. The relationships between parity and ISI(OGTT), CP/FPG and GDM were no 
      longer significant after adjustment for age, pregestational body mass index 
      (BMI), and weight gain. GDM was significantly related to age and pregestational 
      weight, while ISI(OGTT) and CP/FPG were inversely related to prepregnancy BMI or 
      weight gain. In comparison with the index pregnancy, the subsequent pregnancy was 
      characterized by an increase in actual and prepregnancy BMI, in 2 h area under 
      curve (AUC) glucose and by a decrease in ISI(OGTT) (P = 0.0001). The longer the 
      time interval between pregnancies and the higher the increment in pregestational 
      BMI or in weight gain during the pregnancy, the greater were the ISI(OGTT) 
      decrease and 2-h AUC glucose increase. CONCLUSIONS: Parity is not directly linked 
      to insulin sensitivity deterioration, to CP/FPG increase during pregnancy, or to 
      GDM appearance, although it is linked through the mediation of progressive ageing 
      and weight gain either before or during pregnancy, when there is a sufficiently 
      long time interval between pregnancies.
