TI  - Subclavian steal syndrome: can the blood pressure difference between arms predict 
      the severity of steal?
PG  - 131-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A side-to-side difference in systolic brachial arterial 
      blood pressure is a common finding in subclavian artery stenosis and is 
      frequently used as a screening tool for subclavian steal syndrome (SSS). It was 
      the goal of this retrospective study to investigate the relationship between 
      different vertebral artery waveform types and the side-to-side difference in 
      systolic blood pressure in patients with sonographically proven SSS. METHODS: The 
      records of 1860 patients from the Neuroultrasound Laboratory between January 2000 
      and December 2000 were screened for the diagnosis of SSS in the final ultrasound 
      report. In all patients, bilateral brachial arterial blood pressure was measured 
      in a sitting position prior to the ultrasound examination. Vertebral artery 
      waveforms were classified as (1) systolic deceleration, (2) alternating flow, and 
      (3) complete reversal at rest. Blood pressure difference as calculated by 
      normal-side blood pressure minus lesion-side blood pressure was compared with the 
      3 Doppler waveform types. RESULTS: SSS was found in 51 of 1860 (2.7%) 
      ultrasonography studies of 49 patients (17 men, 32 women; mean age 65.3 +/- 10.5 
      years). Two patients (4%) had bilateral SSS. In 3 patients (6%), SSS was related 
      to an innominate artery stenosis. Waveform analysis showed a completely reversed 
      flow in 16 (31%), an alternating flow in 24 (47%), and a systolic deceleration in 
      11 (22%) cases. Systolic blood pressure difference was significantly higher in 
      the complete reversal and alternating groups than in the systolic deceleration 
      group (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Brachial systolic blood pressure difference is 
      related to the severity of SSS and can be used as a screening tool for SSS. 
      However, it performed better in severe steal than milder steal phenomena.
