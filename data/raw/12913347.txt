TI  - Do microbiological factors account for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried 
      pregnant women in Poland?
PG  - 345-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Being unmarried is a well-known risk factor for poor pregnancy outcome 
      such as preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction. The aim of this 
      prospective study was to assess the prevalence and risk of bacterial vaginosis 
      (BV) and selected bacteria isolated from the lower genital tract and to determine 
      the socioeconomic and microbiological characteristics that might be responsible 
      for poor pregnancy outcome observed among unmarried pregnant women. METHODS: The 
      study population comprised 196 pregnant women attending 10 randomly selected 
      outpatient maternity units in the Lodz region, central Poland. Cervicovaginal 
      samples were obtained between 8 and 16 weeks of gestation. Based on Spiegel's 
      criteria, gram-stained vaginal smears were examined for BV and the BV-associated 
      flora was sought by culture. To evaluate the risk factors, relative risk ratios 
      were calculated using EPI INFO software. RESULTS: Among 196 pregnant women, 40 
      (20.4%) were unmarried. BV was diagnosed among 55 (28.1%) women studied. In the 
      univariate analysis, unmarried pregnant women were characterized by younger age, 
      primary educational level, poor economic situation and excessive smoking during 
      pregnancy, as compared to married women. The unmarried status was a borderline 
      risk factor for BV (OR = 1.83, 95% CI 0.94-4.9) after adjustment for age, smoking 
      and education. An analysis of the microbiological culture from the lower genital 
      tract revealed that unmarried pregnant women had a higher risk for several types 
      of pathological microflora, as compared to married women. However, this finding 
      was significant only for Mycoplasma hominis. The independent risk factors of M. 
      hominis were the young age of the subject and a low concentration of 
      Lactobacillus spp. CONCLUSIONS: The observed socioeconomic, demographic and 
      microbiological differences between unmarried and married women could be 
      responsible for the poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in 
      Poland. Unmarried pregnant women should be covered by comprehensive medical care 
      even before pregnancy. Further studies taking into account the role of 
      psychological stress, patterns of sexual behavior and substance abuse during 
      pregnancy could help identify the factors responsible for adverse pregnancy 
      outcome among unmarried pregnant women.
