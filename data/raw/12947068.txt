TI  - Do older men benefit from curative therapy of localized prostate cancer?
PG  - 3318-27
AB  - PURPOSE: Prior decision-analytic models are based on outdated or suboptimal 
      efficacy, patient preference, and comorbidity data. We estimated life expectancy 
      (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) associated with available 
      treatments for localized prostate cancer in men aged >/= 65 years, adjusting for 
      Gleason score, patient preferences, and comorbidity. METHODS: We evaluated three 
      treatments, using a decision-analytic Markov model: radical prostatectomy (RP), 
      external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and watchful waiting (WW). Rates of treatment 
      complications and pretreatment incontinence and impotence were derived from 
      published studies. We estimated treatment efficacy using three data sources: 
      cancer registry cohort data, pooled case series, and modern radiotherapy studies. 
      Utilities were obtained from 141 prostate cancer patients and from published 
      studies. RESULTS: For men with well-differentiated tumors and few comorbidities, 
      potentially curative therapy (RP or EBRT) prolonged LE up to age 75 years but did 
      not improve QALE at any age. For moderately differentiated cancers, potentially 
      curative therapy resulted in LE and QALE gains up to age 75 years. For poorly 
      differentiated disease, potentially curative therapy resulted in LE and QALE 
      gains up to age 80 years. Benefits of potentially curative therapy were 
      restricted to men with no worse than mild comorbidity. When cohort and pooled 
      case series data were used, RP was preferred over EBRT in all groups but was 
      comparable to modern radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Potentially curative therapy 
      results in significantly improved LE and QALE for older men with few 
      comorbidities and moderately or poorly differentiated localized prostate cancer. 
      Age should not be a barrier to treatment in this group.
