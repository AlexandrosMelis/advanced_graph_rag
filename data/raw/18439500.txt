AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess whether it is possible for an experienced laparoscopic 
      surgeon to perform efficient laparoscopic myomectomy regardless of the size, 
      number, and location of the myomas. DESIGN: Prospective observational study 
      (Canadian Task Force classification II-1). SETTING: Tertiary endoscopy center. 
      PATIENTS: A total of 505 healthy nonpregnant women with symptomatic myomas 
      underwent laparoscopic myomectomy at our center. No exclusion criteria were based 
      on the size, number, or location of myomas. INTERVENTIONS: Laparoscopic 
      myomectomy and modifications of the technique: enucleation of the myoma by 
      morcellation while it is still attached to the uterus with and without earlier 
      devascularization. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all, 912 myomas were removed 
      in these 505 patients laparoscopically. The mean number of myomas removed was 
      1.85 +/- 5.706 (95% CI 1.72-1.98). In all, 184 (36.4%) patients had multiple 
      myomectomy. The mean size of the myomas removed was 5.86 +/- 3.300 cm in largest 
      diameter (95% CI 5.56-6.16 cm). The mean weight of the myomas removed was 227.74 
      +/- 325.801 g (95% CI 198.03-257.45 g) and median was 100 g. The median operating 
      time was 60 minutes (range 30-270 minutes). The median blood loss was 90 mL 
      (range 40-2000 mL). Three comparisons were performed on the basis of size of the 
      myomas (<10 cm and >or=10 cm in largest diameter), number of myomas removed 
      (<or=4 and >or=5 myomas), and the technique (enucleation of the myomas by 
      morcellation while the myoma is still attached to the uterus and the conventional 
      technique). In all these comparisons, although the mean blood loss, duration of 
      surgery, and hospital stay were greater in the groups in which larger myomas or 
      more myomas were removed or the modified technique was performed as compared with 
      their corresponding study group, the weight and size of removed myomas were also 
      proportionately larger in these groups. Two patients were given the diagnosis of 
      leiomyosarcoma in their histopathology and 1 patient developed a diaphragmatic 
      parasitic myoma followed by a leiomyoma of the sigmoid colon. Six patients 
      underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy 4 to 6 years after the surgery for recurrent 
      myomas. One conversion to laparotomy occurred and 1 patient underwent open 
      subtotal hysterectomy for dilutional coagulopathy. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic 
      myomectomy can be performed by experienced surgeons regardless of the size, 
      number, or location of the myomas.
