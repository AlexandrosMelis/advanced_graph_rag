TI  - Is amoxapine an atypical antipsychotic? Positron-emission tomography 
      investigation of its dopamine2 and serotonin2 occupancy.
PG  - 1217-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: All currently available atypical antipsychotics have, at clinically 
      relevant doses: i) high serotonin (5-HT)2 occupancy; ii) greater 5-HT2 than 
      dopamine (D)2 occupancy; and iii) a higher incidence of extrapyramidal side 
      effects when their D2 occupancy exceeds 80%. A review of pharmacologic and 
      behavioral data suggested that amoxapine should also conform to this profile; 
      therefore, we undertook a positron-emission tomography (PET) study of its 5-HT2 
      and D2 occupancy. METHODS: Seven healthy volunteers received 50-250 mg/day of 
      amoxapine for 5 days and then had [11C]-raclopride and [18F]-setoperone PET 
      scans. RESULTS: 5-HT2 receptors showed near saturation at doses of 100 mg/day and 
      above. The D2 receptor occupancies showed a dose-dependent increase, never 
      exceeding 80%; at all doses 5-HT2 occupancy exceeded D2 occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      PET data show that amoxapine's profile is very similar to that of the established 
      atypical antipsychotics. These data, together with amoxapine's in vitro 
      pharmacologic profile, effectiveness in animal models, and efficacy in psychotic 
      depression raise the possibility of amoxapine as an "atypical" antipsychotic 
      agent in the treatment of schizophrenia.
