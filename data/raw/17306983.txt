TI  - Is size-reducing ascending aortoplasty with external reinforcement an option in 
      modern aortic surgery?
PG  - 614-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Enlargement of the ascending aorta is often combined with valvular, 
      coronary, or other cardiac diseases. Reduction aortoplasty can be an optional 
      therapy; however, indications regarding the diameter of aorta, the history of 
      dilatation (poststenosis, bicuspid aortic valve), or the intraoperative 
      management (wall excision, reduction suture, external reinforcement) are not 
      established. METHODS: In a retrospective study between 1997 and 2005, we 
      investigated 531 patients operated for aneurysm or ectasia of the ascending aorta 
      (diameter: 45-76mm). Of these, in 50 patients, size-reducing ascending 
      aortoplasty was performed. External reinforcement with a non-coated dacron 
      prosthesis was added in order to stabilize the aortic wall. RESULTS: Aortoplasty 
      was associated with aortic valve replacement in 47 cases (35 mechanical vs 12 
      biological), subvalvular myectomy in 29 cases, and CABG in 13 cases. The 
      procedure was performed with low hospital mortality (2%) and a low postoperative 
      morbidity. Computertomographic and echocardiographic diameters were significantly 
      smaller after reduction (55.8+/-9mm down to 40.51+/-6.2mm (CT), p<0.002; 
      54.1+/-6.7mm preoperatively down to 38.7+/-7.1mm (echocardiography), p<0.002), 
      with stable performance in long-term follow-up (mean follow-up time: 70 months). 
      CONCLUSIONS: As demonstrated in this study, size reduction of the ascending aorta 
      using aortoplasty with external reinforcement is a safe procedure with excellent 
      long-term results. It is a therapeutic option in modern aortic surgery in 
      patients with poststenotic dilatation of the aorta without impairment of the 
      sinotubular junction of the aortic valve and root.
