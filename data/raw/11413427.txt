TI  - Does transverse apex coincide with coronal apex levels (regional or global) in 
      adolescent idiopathic scoliosis?
PG  - 1143-6
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. OBJECTIVES: To identify the regional and global 
      apexes of curves in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and to compare the levels of 
      those with the most rotated vertebral levels on computed tomography scans. 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The terminology regarding the terms and definitions 
      had been arbitrary until being refined and standardized by the Scoliosis Research 
      Society Working Group on Three-Dimensional Terminology of Spinal Deformity. 
      Apical vertebra or disc is defined as the most laterally deviated vertebra or 
      disc in a scoliosis curve, but the most rotated vertebra (or disc) has not been 
      included in this terminology. One study suggested that the most rotated vertebral 
      level was always located at the apex. METHODS: Thirty-three structural curves of 
      25 consecutive patients scheduled for surgery for thoracic or thoracolumbar 
      scoliosis were analyzed with standing anteroposterior radiographs and computed 
      tomography scans covering the curve apexes and pelvis. Thoracic and lumbar curves 
      were evaluated separately for all Type II curves. Vertebral rotations were 
      normalized by the rotation of the pelvis. The most rotated vertebral (or disc) 
      levels (transverse apex) were compared with the regional and global apex levels 
      (vertebra or disc) (coronal apexes) of the corresponding curves separately. 
      RESULTS: Regional and global apexes were at the same level in 18 (54.5%) curves, 
      and within half a level in another 15 (45.4%), and the regional apex was one 
      level higher in two curves (95% confidence levels: -0.82, +0.88). Comparison of 
      the most rotated levels with regional and global apex levels revealed a higher 
      variability, extending up to two levels for the global apex (95% confidence 
      levels: -1.19, +1.54 levels for the global and -1.0, +1.41 levels for the 
      regional apexes). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that the regional or global 
      apex of a given curve is the most rotated level in only a minority of the curves. 
      The most rotated level may be as far as two levels from the global apex and one 
      level from the regional apex.
