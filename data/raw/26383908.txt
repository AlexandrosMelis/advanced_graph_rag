AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the concept mapping as a teaching method 
      in the academic achievement of nursing students. METHOD: This quasi-experimental 
      study was conducted using a crossover design among two groups of total 64 nursing 
      students. Participants were asked to create concept maps (group A) or were 
      evaluated with the traditional method of quiz (group B) for eight weeks and then 
      take a cumulative test (no. 1). Consequently, subjects used the alternate method 
      for another eight weeks and then take the second cumulative test (no. 2). 
      RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the mean scores for cumulative 
      tests (both no. 1 and no. 2) was higher in the group that engaged in map 
      construction compared to the group that only take the quizzes. In addition, there 
      was a gradual increase in the mean scores of developed map during the eight 
      sessions of intervention. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, concept mapping has a 
      positive effect on students' academic achievement. These findings could provide 
      valuable evidence for establishing concept mapping as a continuous teaching 
      strategy for nursing students.
