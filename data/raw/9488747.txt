AB  - BACKGROUND: Apparent life-threatening events in infants are a difficult and 
      frequent problem in pediatric practice. The prognosis is uncertain because of 
      risk of sudden infant death syndrome. CASE REPORTS: Eight infants aged 2 to 15 
      months were admitted during a period of 6 years; they suffered from similar 
      maladies in the bath: on immersion, they became pale, hypotonic, still and 
      unreactive; recovery took a few seconds after withdrawal from the bath and 
      stimulation. Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal 
      reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic 
      urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's 
      family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after 
      exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase 
      in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The 
      evolution of these "aquagenic maladies" was favourable after a few weeks without 
      baths. After a 2-7 year follow-up, three out of seven infants continue to suffer 
      from troubles associated with sun or water. CONCLUSION: "Aquagenic maladies" 
      could be a pediatric form of the aquagenic urticaria.
