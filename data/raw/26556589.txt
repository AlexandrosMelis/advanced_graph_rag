AB  - BACKGROUND: Achilles tendon structure deteriorates 2-days after maximal loading 
      in elite athletes. The load-response behaviour of tendons may be altered in type 
      1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) as hyperglycaemia accelerates collagen cross-linking. 
      This study compared Achilles tendon load-response in participants with T1DM and 
      controls. METHODS: Achilles tendon structure was quantified at day-0, day-2 and 
      day-4 after a 10 km run. Ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) measures tendon 
      structural integrity by classifying pixels as echo-type I, II, III or IV. 
      Echo-type I has the most aligned collagen fibrils and IV has the least. RESULTS: 
      Participants were 7 individuals with T1DM and 10 controls. All regularly ran 
      distances greater than 5 km and VISA-A scores indicated good tendon function 
      (T1DM = 94 +/- 11, control = 94 +/- 10). There were no diabetic complications and 
      HbA1c was 8.7 +/- 2.6 mmol/mol for T1DM and 5.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/mol for control groups. 
      Baseline tendon structure was similar in T1DM and control groups - UTC echo-types 
      (I-IV) and anterior-posterior thickness were all p > 0.05. No response to load 
      was seen in either T1DM or control group over the 4-days post exercise. 
      CONCLUSION: Active individuals with T1DM do not have a heightened Achilles tendon 
      response to load, which suggests no increased risk of tendon injury. We cannot 
      extrapolate these findings to sedentary individuals with T1DM.
