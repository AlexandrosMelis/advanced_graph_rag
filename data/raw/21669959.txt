TI  - Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for 
      significant health disparities?

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) threatens fragile infants 
      discharged from a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Smoking practices were 
      examined in families with a high respiratory risk infant (born at very low birth 
      weight; ventilated > 12 hr) in a Houston, Texas, NICU. Socioeconomic status, 
      race, and mental health status were hypothesized to be related to SHSe and 
      household smoking bans. METHODS: Data were collected as part of The Baby's Breath 
      Project, a hospital-based SHSe intervention trial targeting parents with a 
      high-risk infant in the NICU who reported a smoker in the household (N = 99). 
      Measures of sociodemographics, smoking, home and car smoking bans, and depression 
      were collected. RESULTS: Overall, 26% of all families with a high-risk infant in 
      the NICU reported a household smoker. Almost half of the families with a smoker 
      reported an annual income of less than $25,000. 46.2% of families reported having 
      a total smoking ban in place in both their homes and cars. Only 27.8% families 
      earning less than $25,000 reported having a total smoking ban in place relative 
      to almost 60% of families earning more (p < .01). African American and Caucasian 
      families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p < 
      .05). Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had 
      a household smoking ban (p < .02). CONCLUSIONS: The most disadvantaged families 
      were least likely to have protective health behaviors in place to reduce SHSe 
      and, consequently, are most at-risk for tobacco exposure and subsequent 
      tobacco-related health disparities. Innovative SHSe interventions for this 
      vulnerable population are sorely needed.
