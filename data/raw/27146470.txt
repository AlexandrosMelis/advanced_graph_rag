AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) patients face numerous difficulties adhering to the 
      long-term, rigorous TB treatment regimen. Findings on TB patients' treatment 
      adherence vary across existing literature and official reports. The present study 
      attempted to determine the actual treatment adherence of new TB patients and to 
      identify factors leading to non-adherence. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 481 
      newly confirmed TB patients from three counties in western China were enrolled 
      during June to December 2012 and was followed until June 2013. Patients who 
      missed at least one dose of drugs or one follow-up re-examination during the 
      treatment course were deemed as non-adherent. Influencing factors were identified 
      using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 173 (36.0 %) patients 
      experienced non-adherence and the loss to follow-up cases reached 136 (28.2 %). 
      Only 13.9 % of patients took drugs under direct observation, and 60.5 % of 
      patients were supervised by phone calls. Factor analyses suggested that patients 
      who were observed by family members (OR:5.54, 95 % CI:2.87-10.69) and paying 
      monthly service expenses above 450 RMB (OR:2.08, 95 % CI:1.35-3.19) were more 
      likely to be non-adherent, while supervision by home visit (OR:0.06, 95 % 
      CI:0.01-0.28) and phone calls (OR:0.27, 95 % CI:0.17-0.44) were protective 
      factors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite recent efforts, a large proportion of newly 
      confirmed TB patients could not adhere to standard TB treatment, and patients' 
      lost to follow-up was still a serious problem. Poor treatment supervision and 
      heavy financial burden might be the main causes for non-adherence. More needs to 
      be done to enhance treatment supervision policies and financial supports to both 
      health providers and TB patients.
