      child?

AB  - OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: In a prospective study 218 preschool children were 
      enrolled (stratified in 2 training programs, one specialized for phonologic 
      awareness in order to prevent dyslexia, the other consisting in training of 
      general perception) during the last year of kindergarten. After finishing the 
      first grade 131 children were compared in their reading and writing abilities. 
      RESULTS: In the whole group only a slight difference was found between both 
      training modalities concerning their writing abilities. However, children with a 
      history of hearing loss, actual hearing loss or pathologic middle ear findings 
      profited most from the specialized training program compared to the control in 
      their reading abilities. CONCLUSION: A specialized training program to improve 
      phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and 
      preschool child seems to be unnecessary. However, children with temporary hearing 
      deficits benefit from such a program. For all other children general perception 
      training may be sufficient.
