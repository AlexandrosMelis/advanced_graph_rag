TI  - The clinical significance of bile duct sludge: is it different from bile duct 
      stones?
PG  - 769-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are found 
      to have sludge and no stones. Although sludge in the gallbladder is a precursor 
      of gallbladder stones, the significance of bile duct sludge (BDS) is poorly 
      defined. This study aimed to compare BDS with bile duct stones in terms of 
      frequency, associated risk factors, and clinical outcome after endoscopic 
      therapy. METHODS: The study enrolled 228 patients who underwent therapeutic 
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected 
      choledocholithiasis. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with BDS 
      but no stones on ERCP and patients with CBD stones. The presence of risk factors 
      for bile duct stones (age, periampullary diverticulum, ductal dilation or 
      angulation, previous open cholecystectomy) were assessed at ERCP. Follow-up data 
      (36 +/- 19 months) were obtained from medical records and by patient questioning. 
      RESULTS: Bile duct sludge occurred in 14% (31/228) of patients and was more 
      common in females. After endoscopic clearance, CBD stones recurred in 17% 
      (33/197) of the patients with CBD stones, and in 16% (5/31) of the patients with 
      BDS (p = 0.99). Common bile duct dilation was less common in the sludge group. 
      The other known risk factors for recurrent CBD stones (age, previous open 
      cholecystectomy, bile duct angulation, and the presence of a peripampullary 
      diverticulum) were not statistically different between the two groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that the clinical significance of symptomatic 
      BDS is similar to that of CBD stones. Bile duct sludge seems to be an early stage 
      of choledocholithiasis.
