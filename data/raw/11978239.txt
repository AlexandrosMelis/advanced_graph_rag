TI  - Do primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease? 
      Report from an Italian research network.
PG  - 265
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine how often primary care physicians prescribe eradication 
      therapy for peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). STUDY 
      DESIGN: During a 2-year period (1998-2000) we analyzed data concerning patients 
      with PUD or NUD seen by 80 Italian primary care physicians uniformly distributed 
      throughout the country. We classified patients as having a definitive or a 
      presumptive diagnosis on the basis of the completeness of the diagnostic workup 
      and interpreted the prescription of antibiotics for dyspepsia as evidence of 
      attempted eradication of Helicobacter pylori. POPULATION: Consecutive ambulatory 
      patients. OUTCOMES MEASURED: The frequency with which predefined groups of 
      patients received eradication therapy. RESULTS: Of 6866 patients, 690 (10%) 
      received eradication therapy. Of 2162 patients with PUD, 596 (27.6%) received 
      eradication therapy; of 4704 patients with NUD, however, only 94 (2%) received 
      this treatment (P =.0001). A total of 341 (37.7%) of 904 PUD patients with a 
      definitive diagnosis were given eradication therapy and 255 (20.3%) of 1258 PUD 
      patients with a presumptive diagnosis were given therapy (P &lt.0001). In NUD 
      patients, 7 of 743 (0.9%) with a definitive diagnosis received eradication 
      therapy, while 87 (2.2%) of 3961 of those with a presumptive diagnosis were given 
      the same therapy (P =.025). CONCLUSIONS: While Italian primary care physicians 
      appropriately target eradication therapy for H pylori infection in patients with 
      peptic ulcer disease rather than nonulcer disease, the intervention was still 
      underused in these patients. Improvements in this prescribing behavior are 
      needed.
