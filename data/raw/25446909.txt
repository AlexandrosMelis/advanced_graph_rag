      disease?

AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To describe clinical characteristics of oral 
      mucoceles/ranulas, with a focus on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related 
      salivary gland diseases. STUDY DESIGN: A descriptive and clinical study, with 
      review of patient data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We reviewed 113 referred cases of 
      oral mucocele. The following anatomical sites were identified: lip, tongue, and 
      floor of the mouth (simple ranulas), as well as plunging ranulas. The age and 
      gender data of the patients with oral mucoceles were recorded. The HIV status of 
      the patients and other information were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 30 (26.5%) 
      males and 83 (73.5%) females. Most patients were below 30 years of age, with the 
      peak frequency in the first and second decade. Ranula (simple and plunging) 
      represented 84.1% of the mucocele locations. Mucocele on the lips represented 
      10.6%. Seventy-two (63.7%) patients were HIV positive; and 97.2% of them had 
      ranulas. Thirty-eight (33.6%) patients presented with plunging ranulas; and 92.1% 
      of them were HIV positive, compared with two patients presenting with plunging 
      ranulas in the HIV-negative group. These results strongly suggest that an 
      HIV-positive patient is statistically (P < 0.001) more at risk of presenting with 
      not only a simple, but also a plunging ranula type. CONCLUSION: This study 
      presents a different clinical picture of oral mucoceles/ranulas, as observed in 
      HIV-positive patients. Additionally, it suggests a possible clinical link between 
      the two pathologies. The authors strongly support the suggestion that oral 
      mucocele/ranula is an HIV-related salivary gland disease. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.
