TI  - Metered-dose inhalers. Do health care providers know what to teach?
PG  - 81-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this investigation was to evaluate the proficiency 
      of health care providers and patients in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. 
      DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Health care providers, which include house 
      staff, nurses, and respiratory care practitioners who provide care to patients 
      with asthma in the primary general medicine clinic or the pulmonary medicine 
      clinic of a university-county hospital in which patients were referred, were 
      surveyed and assigned a performance score regarding the knowledge base of the 
      appropriate use of metered-dose inhalers. Patients who attended the primary care 
      general medicine and pulmonary subspecialty clinic were also assessed as to their 
      proficiency in the use of metered-dose inhalers. RESULTS: A significant 
      percentage of patients had a poor understanding of the technique used with the 
      metered-dose inhaler. House staff and nursing staff were also less proficient in 
      the proper use of the metered-dose inhaler. The respiratory care practitioners 
      were the most knowledgeable of the health care providers. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      confirms that a large percentage of patients use metered-dose inhalers 
      improperly. It also demonstrates a significant lack of understanding by health 
      care providers of the proper use of metered-dose inhalers. Furthermore, this 
      study supports the use of respiratory care practitioners in the outpatient 
      setting, since they were the most proficient among all the health care providers 
      in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.
