      disease?

AB  - CONCLUSION: We conclude that not all low-tone sudden deafness (SD) patients 
      suffered from endolymphatic hydrops even if they had vertigo attack at the onset 
      and that electrocochleography (ECochG) was a useful prognostic tool. OBJECTIVES: 
      To investigate whether low-tone SD was a precursor of Meniere's disease and 
      whether patients with low-tone SD suffered from endolymphatic hydrops. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case review in the university hospital. A 
      total of 184 patients with low-tone SD were divided into two groups with single 
      and recurrent episodes. The progress, follow-up audiograms, and ECochG results of 
      the patients were reviewed and compared with those of patients with high-tone SD 
      and Meniere's disease. RESULTS: In all, 83 of 177 patients with low-tone SD 
      unaccompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing loss; 15 of the 83 developed 
      vertiginous attacks. The remaining 94 patients had a single episode. Three of the 
      seven patients with low-tone SD accompanied by vertigo had recurrent hearing 
      loss; two of the three were subsequently confirmed to have Meniere's disease. The 
      other four had a single episode. No difference in rate of progress from SD to 
      Meniere's disease was observed among the low-tone and the high-tone SD groups. 
      The average -SP/AP of each group with a single episode is smaller than that of 
      other groups with recurrent episodes and Meniere's disease.
