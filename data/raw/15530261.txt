TI  - Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with 
      ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients?
PG  - 317-25
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of 
      ultrasonographic screening for primary hepatocellular carcinoma. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 680 eligible cases were classified into three groups 
      (surveillance, opportunistic, and symptomatic groups) according to their initial 
      exposure. We used survival time, tumor morphology, and T staging as prognostic 
      outcomes. The outcomes of screened/unscreened and sur veillance/nonsur veillance 
      were compared with the use of the logistic regression model. RESULTS: The 
      adjusted odds ratios for the screened group versus the unscreened group, with 1-, 
      2-, and 3-year survival time being used as outcomes, were 0.33 (95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 0.21-0.52), 0.33 (95% CI, 0.21-0.53), and 0.37 (95% CI, 
      0.23-0.61), respectively. The adjusted odds ratios for surveillance versus 
      nonsurveillance were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.97), 0.45 (95% CI, 0.27-0.74), and 0.44 
      (95% CI, 0.26-0.73). The odds ratios were even smaller when tumor morphology or T 
      stage was taken as the main outcome. All these results were statistically 
      significant. There were significant gradient relationships between prognostic 
      outcomes and extent of screening history. CONCLUSION: The significant impact of 
      ultrasonographic screening on mortality reduction was demonstrated. These 
      findings strongly suggest that early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma by 
      ultrasound may improve the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
