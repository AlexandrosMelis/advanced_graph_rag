TI  - Hypotension in patients with coronary disease: can profound hypotensive events 
      cause myocardial ischaemic events?
PG  - 477-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anginal episodes might be related to extremes of 
      hypotension in patients with ischaemic heart disease taking drugs to treat angina 
      and heart failure. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational study of patients with 
      ischaemic heart disease attending an urban tertiary referral cardiology centre. 
      INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: A selected patient population was enrolled, 
      having: angina on one or more hypotensive cardiovascular medications; hypotension 
      on clinic or ambulatory measurement; and a resting ECG suitable for ambulatory 
      monitoring. Patients had echocardiography, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 
      and Holter monitoring. Hypotension induced ischaemic (HII) events were defined as 
      episodes of ST segment ischaemia occurring at least one minute after an 
      ambulatory blood pressure measurement (systolic/diastolic) below 100/65 mm Hg 
      during the day, or 90/50 mm Hg at night. RESULTS: 25 suitable patients were 
      enrolled, and 107 hypotensive events were documented. 40 ST events occurred in 14 
      patients, of which a quarter were symptomatic. Fourteen HII events occurred in 
      eight patients, with 13 of the 14 preceded by a fall in diastolic pressure 
      (median diastolic pressure 57.5 mm Hg, interquartile range 11, maximum 72 mm Hg, 
      minimum 45 mm Hg), and six preceded by a fall in systolic pressure (chi(2) = 
      11.9, p < 0.001). ST events were significantly associated with preceding 
      hypotensive events (chi(2) = 40.2, p < 0.0001). Patients with HII events were 
      more frequently taking multiple hypotensive drug regimens (8/8 v 9/17, chi(2) = 
      5.54, p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ischaemic heart disease and 
      hypotension, symptomatic and silent ischaemia occurred in a temporally causal 
      relation with hypotension, particularly for diastolic pressures, suggesting that 
      patients with coronary disease may be susceptible to ischaemic events incurred as 
      a result of low blood pressure caused by excessive hypotensive drug treatment.
