AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of delivery mode on women's postpartum 
      quality of life in rural China and probe factors influencing postnatal quality of 
      life. BACKGROUND: Childbirth significantly affects puerpera's physical, 
      psychological and social domains of quality of life. Under the circumstance of 
      increasing high caesarean section rate in rural China, the impact of delivery 
      mode on postnatal quality of life remains unclear. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study 
      design. METHODS: Women residing in rural areas and in their 0-12 months after 
      childbirth from 30 rural townships participated in a household survey. A 
      structured questionnaire was used to evaluate women's socio-demographic 
      characteristics, previous pregnant experiences, foetal characteristics and use of 
      maternal health services. The scale for rural postnatal quality of life was 
      adopted to assess postnatal quality of life from six dimensions: physical 
      complaints and pain, sleep and energy, sex satisfaction, interpersonal 
      communication, self-evaluated living stress and perceived life satisfaction. 
      RESULTS: The overall caeserean section rate was 70.0% (962/1375), and most of 
      them (59.7%) were selected by maternal request. None of six dimensions and total 
      score of quality of life displayed significant difference between women with 
      normal delivery and cesaerean section. It was found that postnatal home visit 
      related to good postnatal quality of life and lower husband education level, male 
      gender of infant were associated with poor quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Delivery 
      mode did not affect postpartum quality of life in rural China. Socio-cultural 
      determinants may contribute more in influencing postnatal quality of life. 
      RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Null findings in impact of delivery mode on 
      postpartum quality of life may cause more difficulties in maternal 
      decision-making for vaginal delivery in rural China. The importance of postnatal 
      home visit could justify available and quality postnatal care in improving 
      postpartum quality of life. Further research needs to explore the effective 
      prevention programmes, especially attention for parenting boys.
