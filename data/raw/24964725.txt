TI  - Recovery Outcome Measures: Is There a Place for Culture, Attitudes, and Faith?
PG  - 171-9
LID - 10.1111/ppc.12078 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Utilization of the Recovery Knowledge Inventory (RKI) and Recovery 
      Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ) in southeastern Australia raised questions about 
      the RAQ, including links between attitudes, faith, and culture in supporting the 
      recovery journey. These questions are particularly important when considered in 
      the context of people with mental illness who live in secular multicultural 
      societies. CONCLUSIONS: This paper discusses the cultural appropriateness of the 
      RAQ in Australian settings, and identifies the need to develop rigorous, 
      inclusive recovery outcome measures. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: It is important to 
      identify what best motivates people in their recovery journey, and to find a way 
      to harness these motivating factors to achieve the best possible outcomes.
