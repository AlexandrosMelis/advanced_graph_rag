TI  - Is laparoscopic cholecystectomy safe and acceptable as a day case procedure?
PG  - 365-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study reviewed the results of performing day case laparoscopic 
      cholecystectomy to assess the feasibility and safety of the procedure as a day 
      case. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective study of 150 day case 
      laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed between September 1999 and December 2004 
      under the care of the senior author. The results of a follow-up questionnaire to 
      assess post-discharge clinical course and patient satisfaction were analyzed. All 
      patients had commenced eating and drinking and were fully mobile before discharge 
      home. The length of hospital stay was 4-8 hours. RESULTS: The mean age of the 
      patients was 43 years; 134 patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      grade I, the remaining 16 patients were grade II. The mean operative time was 41 
      minutes. There were no conversions to open procedures. There was no bleeding, no 
      visceral injury, and no mortality. There was one admission directly from the day 
      surgical unit (admission rate of 0.6%), but no readmission following discharge. 
      No patients were admitted due to postoperative nausea or pain. Ninety-nine (66%) 
      of 150 patients responded to our questionnaire: 97% were satisfied about the 
      information they had received. Patients rated their satisfaction with the 
      procedure as follows: 75% excellent, 21% good, 3% satisfied, and 1 patient 
      un-satisfied. Ninety-four percent of the patients would recommend the procedure 
      as a day case. CONCLUSION: Day case laparoscopic cholecystectomy is safe, 
      feasible, and cost-effective when patients are carefully selected. It provides 
      good patient satisfaction.
