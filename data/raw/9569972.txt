TI  - Proliferative index obtained by DNA image cytometry. Does it add prognostic 
      information in Auer IV breast cancer?
PG  - 144-52
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the S + G2/M fraction (proliferative index) is 
      a prognostic determinant in breast cancers classified as Auer IV. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Prognostic evaluation of Auer IV DNA histograms with respect to the high versus 
      low S + G2/M fraction, obtained by image cytometry on consecutive breast cancer 
      imprint preparations. RESULTS: When studying recurrence-free survival (n = 136), 
      the prognostic value of S + G2/M was found to vary with time: it was negligible 
      before the median time to relapse (1.5 years) but thereafter statistically 
      significant, in both univariate and multivariate analysis. The same pattern was 
      found when overall survival was used as the end point; the effect was delayed to 
      about the median time until death (three years). Tumors with a low S + G2/M 
      fraction were smaller and more often estrogen receptor- and progesterone 
      receptor-positive than those with a high S + G2/M fraction. CONCLUSION: According 
      to ICM-DNA values corresponding to the S + G2/M region, patients with breast 
      cancers classified as Auer IV can be divided into subgroups with different tumor 
      characteristics and prognoses.
