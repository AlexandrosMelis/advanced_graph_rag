TI  - Can we predict urinary stone composition based on an analysis of microelement 
      concentration in the hair and urine?
PG  - 469-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years the role of trace elements in lithogenesis has 
      received steadily increasing attention. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to 
      attempt to find the correlations between the chemical content of the stones and 
      the concentration of chosen elements in the urine and hair of stone formers. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The proposal for the study was approved by the local ethics 
      committee. Specimens were taken from 219 consecutive stone-formers. The content 
      of the stone was evaluated using atomic absorption spectrometry, 
      spectrophotometry, and colorimetric methods. An analysis of 29 elements in hair 
      and 21 elements in urine was performed using inductively coupled plasma-atomic 
      emission spectrometry. RESULTS: Only a few correlations between the composition 
      of stones and the distribution of elements in urine and in hair were found. All 
      were considered incidental. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained did not allow for the 
      creation of a proper and practical algorithm to predict stone chemical 
      composition based on hair and urine analysis.
