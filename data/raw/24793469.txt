AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic autoimmune 
      demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The purpose of this study is 
      to determine the relationship between the site of the cervical discopathy and 
      cervical spinal cord plaque in MS patients. METHODS: This retrospective study 
      included all patients with a definite diagnosis of MS who were treated at an 
      outpatient clinic between September 2004 and September 2011. All patients 
      underwent cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for primary investigation of 
      the disease. Cervical MRI scans were evaluated for detection of any evidence of 
      cervical discopathy and cervical MS plaques. Any correlation between the site of 
      the MS lesions and discopathy was recorded. RESULTS: From 536 patients who were 
      involved in the study, 214 patients had both cervical discopathy and cervical 
      cord plaques. In this group 148 (69.1% of patients) had cervical plaque at the 
      same site of cervical discopathy. The number of patients with cervical cord 
      plaque and discopathy at same site was significantly higher than those with 
      plaque and discopathy at different sites (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The study data 
      suggests a possible correlation between cervical discopathy and cervical MS 
      plaque.
