AB  - BACKGROUND: Men appear to benefit more from being married than women with respect 
      to mortality in middle age. However, there is some uncertainty about gender 
      differences in mortality risks in older individuals, widowed, divorced and single 
      individuals and about the impact of living arrangements. METHODS: Longitudinal 
      data with 1990 census records being linked to mortality data up to 2005 were used 
      (Swiss National Cohort). The sample comprised all residents over age 44 years in 
      Switzerland (n=2,440,242). All-cause mortality HRs for marital status and living 
      arrangements were estimated by Cox regression for men and women and different age 
      groups with adjustment for education and socio-professional category. RESULTS: 
      The benefit of being married was stronger for men than for women; however, 
      mortality patterns were similar, with higher mortality in divorced and single 
      individuals compared with widowed individuals (<80 years). After adjustment for 
      living arrangements, the gender difference by marital status disappeared. 
      Stratification by living arrangement revealed that mortality risks were highest 
      for 45-64-year-old divorced (HR 1.72 (95% CI 1.67 to 1.76)) and single men (HR 
      1.67 (95% CI 1.63 to 1.71)) who lived alone. In women of the same age, the 
      highest mortality risk was observed for those who were single and living with a 
      partner (HR 1.70 (95% CI 1.58 to 1.82)). In older age groups, the impact of 
      marital status decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of living arrangements is 
      crucial for identifying and explaining gender differences in mortality risks by 
      marital status. The impact of living alone and living with a partner seems to be 
      different in men and women.
