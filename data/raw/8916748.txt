TI  - Do socioeconomic differences in mortality persist after retirement? 25 year 
      follow up of civil servants from the first Whitehall study.
PG  - 1177-80
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of death associated with work based and non-work 
      based measures of socioeconomic status before and after retirement age. DESIGN: 
      Follow up study of mortality in relation to employment grade and car ownership 
      over 25 years. SETTING: The first Whitehall study. SUBJECTS: 18,133 male civil 
      servants aged 40-69 years who attended a screening examination between 1967 and 
      1970. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Death. RESULTS: Grade of employment was a strong 
      predictor of mortality before retirement. For men dying at ages 40-64 the lowest 
      employment grade had 3.12 times the mortality of the highest grade (95% 
      confidence interval 2.4 to 4.1). After retirement the ability of grade to predict 
      mortality declined (rate ratio 1.86; 1.6 to 2.2). A non-work based measure of 
      socioeconomic status (car ownership) predicted mortality less well than 
      employment grade before retirement but its ability to predict mortality declined 
      less after retirement. Using a relative index of inequality that was sensitive to 
      the distribution among socioeconomic groups showed employment grade and car 
      ownership to have independent associations with mortality that were of equal 
      magnitude after retirement. The absolute difference in death rates between the 
      lowest and highest employment grades increased with age from 12.9 per 1000 person 
      years at ages 40-64 to 38.3 per 1000 at ages 70-89. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic 
      differences in mortality persist beyond retirement age and in magnitude increase 
      with age. Social differentials in mortality based on an occupational status 
      measure seem to decrease to a greater degree after retirement than those based on 
      a non-work measure. This suggests that alongside other socioeconomic factors work 
      itself may play an important part in generating social inequalities in health in 
      men of working age.
