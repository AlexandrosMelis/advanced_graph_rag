AB  - OBJECTIVE: Measurement of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) needs to be accurate and 
      sensitive to change for risk monitoring. The purpose of this study is to 
      determine the CT slice location where VAT area can best reflect changes in VAT 
      volume and body weight. METHODS: 60 plain abdominal CT images from 30 males [mean 
      age (range) 51 (41-68) years, mean body weight (range) 71.1 (101.9-50.9) kg] who 
      underwent workplace screenings twice within a 1-year interval were evaluated. 
      Automatically calculated and manually corrected areas of the VAT of various scan 
      levels using "freeform curve" region of interest on CT were recorded and compared 
      with body weight changes. RESULTS: The strongest correlations of VAT area with 
      VAT volume and body weight changes were shown in a slice 3 cm above the lower 
      margin of L3 with r values of 0.853 and 0.902, respectively. CONCLUSION: VAT area 
      measurement at a single level 3 cm above the lower margin of the L3 vertebra is 
      feasible and can reflect changes in VAT volume and body weight. Advances in 
      knowledge: As VAT area at a CT slice 3cm above the lower margin of L3 can best 
      reflect interval changes in VAT volume and body weight, VAT area measurement 
      should be selected at this location.
