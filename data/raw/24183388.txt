AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess if the Hawkins sign can predict whether or not astragalus 
      fractures of the neck will develop avascular necrosis. It is also assessed 
      whether the occurrence of this complication is related to the displacement of the 
      fracture, soft tissue injury, or delay in the reduction or surgery. The results 
      were compared with those found in the literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 
      retrospective study was conducted on 23 talar neck fractures recorded over a a 
      period of thirteen years. The following variables were analysed: displacement of 
      the fracture, soft tissue injury, delay and type of treatment, complications, 
      observation of the Hawkins sign, and functional outcome. RESULTS: There were 7 
      type I Hawkins fractures, 11 type II, and 4 type III and 1 type IV. Four cases 
      developed avascular necrosis (2 Hawkins type II and 2 type III). Hawkins sign was 
      observed in 12 cases, of which none developed necrosis. Four cases with negative 
      Hawkins sign developed necrosis. No statistically significant differences were 
      found when comparing the development of avascular necrosis with the displacement 
      of the fracture, soft tissue injury, or delay in treatment. Differences were 
      found when comparing the development of avascular necrosis with the Hawkins sign 
      (P=.03). CONCLUSION: A positive Hawkins sign rules out that the fractured talus 
      has developed avascular necrosis, but its absence does not confirm it.
