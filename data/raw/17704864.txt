TI  - Is laparoscopic adrenalectomy safe and effective for adrenal masses larger than 7 
      cm?
PG  - 516-21
AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic adrenalectomy (LA) has become the gold standard 
      treatment for small (less than 6 cm) adrenal masses. However, the role of LA for 
      large-volume (more than 6 cm) masses has not been well defined. Our aim was to 
      evaluate, retrospectively, the outcome of LA for adrenal lesions larger than 7 
      cm. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 18 consecutive laparoscopic adrenalectomies were 
      performed from 1996 to 2005 on patients with adrenal lesions larger than 7 cm. 
      RESULTS: The mean tumor size was 8.3 cm (range 7-13 cm), the mean operative time 
      was 137 min, the mean blood loss was 182 mL (range 100-550 mL), the rate of 
      intraoperative complications was 16%, and in three cases we switched from 
      laparoscopic procedure to open surgery. CONCLUSIONS: LA for adrenal masses larger 
      than 7 cm is a safe and feasible technique, offering successful outcome in terms 
      of intraoperative and postoperative morbidity, hospital stay and cosmesis for 
      patients; it seems to replicate open surgical oncological principles 
      demonstrating similar outcomes as survival rate and recurrence rate, when adrenal 
      cortical carcinoma were treated. The main contraindication for this approach is 
      the evidence, radiologically and intraoperatively, of local infiltration of 
      periadrenal tissue.
