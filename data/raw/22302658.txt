TI  - Does limb-salvage surgery offer patients better quality of life and functional 
      capacity than amputation?

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with aggressive lower extremity musculoskeletal tumors may 
      be candidates for either above-knee amputation or limb-salvage surgery. However, 
      the subjective and objective benefits of limb-salvage surgery compared with 
      amputation are not fully clear. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We therefore compared 
      functional status and quality of life for patients treated with above-knee 
      amputation versus limb-salvage surgery. METHODS: We reviewed 20 of 51 patients 
      aged 15 years and older treated with above-knee amputation or limb-salvage 
      surgery for aggressive musculoskeletal tumors around the knee between 1994 and 
      2004 as a retrospective cohort study. At last followup we obtained the 
      Physiological Cost Index, the Reintegration to Normal Living Index, SF-36, and 
      the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score questionnaires. The minimum followup was 12 
      months (median, 56 months; range, 12-108 months). RESULTS: Compared with patients 
      having above-knee amputation, patients undergoing limb-salvage surgery had 
      superior Physiological Cost Index scores and Reintegration to Normal Living 
      Index. The Toronto Extremity Salvage scores and SF-36 scores were similar in the 
      two groups. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that limb-salvage surgery offers 
      better gait efficiency and return to normal living compared with above-knee 
      amputation, but does not improve the patient's perception of quality of life.
