AB  - AIM: To investigate the benefits of pulpotomy (to the level of the floor of the 
      pulp chamber) as an endodontic treatment for teeth with vital pulps. METHODOLOGY: 
      Seventeen patients, aged 7-54 years (mean of 37.2 year), were treated by 
      pulpotomy and filling with ProRoot MTA((R)) in premolar or molar teeth with vital 
      pulps and without clinical evidence of irreversible pulpitis. The patients were 
      then followed up for 12 to 24 months and the teeth then assessed by clinical and 
      radiographic examination. Statistical analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier 
      survival probability statistics to estimate the survival of the treated teeth. 
      RESULTS: At 24 months, the survival rate without any complementary treatment was 
      estimated to be 82%. Two of the 17 treated teeth required root canal treatment 
      for pain control and one for prosthetic reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Under the 
      conditions of this study, pulpotomy offered a viable alternative to root canal 
      treatment for teeth with vital pulps in the short term. However, there is 
      insufficient clinical evidence to consider this technique for the treatment of 
      every permanent tooth. Nevertheless, it should be considered as a potential 
      alternative approach to be further developed for future applications.
