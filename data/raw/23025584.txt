AB  - BACKGROUND: That alcohol consumption is strongly influenced by the drinking 
      behavior of social company has been demonstrated in observational research. 
      However, not everyone is equally vulnerable to other people's drinking, and it is 
      important to unravel which factors underlie these individual differences. This 
      study focuses on the role of psychosocial stress in attempting to explain 
      individual differences in the propensity to imitate alcohol consumption. METHODS: 
      With a 2 (confederate's drinking condition: alcohol vs. soda) x 2 (participant's 
      stress condition: stress vs. no stress) experimental design, we tested whether 
      the tendency to imitate other people's drinking was related to participants' 
      induced stress levels. The young male adults (N = 106) were randomly assigned to 
      each of the conditions. In each session, directly after the stress or no-stress 
      period, confederates and participants entered a bar laboratory where we observed 
      their drinking behavior. Prior to entering the session, confederates were 
      instructed to drink alcohol or soda. RESULTS: Participants in both stress and 
      no-stress conditions consumed substantially more alcohol when confederates drank 
      alcohol than when they drank soda. There was no difference in alcohol consumed 
      between stress and no-stress conditions. No moderating effect of stress on the 
      tendency to drink along with peers was found. CONCLUSIONS: Generally, it appears 
      that among young male adults, imitation of alcohol consumption is a robust 
      phenomenon not dependent on individual stress levels.
