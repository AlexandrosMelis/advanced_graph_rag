TI  - Does the severity of obstructive sleep apnea predict patients requiring high 
      continuous positive airway pressure?
PG  - 951-5
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To investigate polysomnographic and anthropomorphic factors 
      predicting need of high optimal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). 
      DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. PATIENTS: Three hundred fifty-three 
      consecutive obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients who had a successful manual 
      CPAP titration in our sleep disorders unit. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean 
      optimal CPAP was 9.5 +/- 2.4 cm H2O. The optimal CPAP pressure increases with an 
      increase in OSA severity from 7.79 +/- 2.2 in the mild, to 8.7 +/- 1.8 in the 
      moderate, and to 10.1 +/- 2.3 cm H2O in the severe OSA group. A high CPAP was 
      defined as the mean + 1 standard deviation (SD; > or =12 cm H2O). The predictor 
      variables included apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), age, sex, body mass index (BMI), 
      Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). High 
      CPAP was required in 2 (6.9%), 6 (5.8%), and 63 (28.6%) patients with mild, 
      moderate, and severe OSA, respectively. On univariate analysis, AHI, BMI, ESS 
      score, and the proportion of males were significantly higher in those needing 
      high CPAP. They also have a lower MSLT mean. On logistic regression, the use of 
      high CPAP was 5.90 times more frequent (95% confidence interval 2.67-13.1) in 
      severe OSA patients after adjustment for the other variables. The area under the 
      receiver operator curve was 72.4%, showing that the model was adequate. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Severe OSA patients are much more likely to need high CPAP levels. 
      However, because of the low positive predictive value (only 28.6%), the clinical 
      value of such information is limited. ESS and MSLT did not increase the 
      predictive value for the need for high CPAP.
