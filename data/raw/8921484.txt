TI  - Does gestational age misclassification explain the difference in birthweights for 
      Australian aborigines and whites?
PG  - 980-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: After 34 weeks gestation, summary measures of location for 
      birthweight (e.g means and centiles) increase more slowly for Australian 
      Aborigines than for whites. A similar pattern has been observed for blacks in the 
      US. This study tests whether the reported pattern is due to differential 
      misclassification of gestational age. METHODS: Simulation was used to measure the 
      potential effect of differential misclassification of gestational age. Reported 
      gestational age data were obtained from Queensland Perinatal Data Collection 
      (QPDC). Estimates of the true distributions of gestational age were obtained by 
      assuming various (plausible) types of misclassification and applying these to the 
      reported distributions. Previous studies and data from the QPDC were used to help 
      specify the birthweight distributions used in the simulations. RESULTS: At full 
      term, the parameters of the birthweight distributions were robust to gestational 
      age misclassification. At preterm, the 10th centiles were robust to 
      misclassification. In contrast, the 90th centiles were sensitive to even minor 
      misclassification. Extreme types of misclassification were required to remove the 
      divergence in median birthweights for Aborigines and whites. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Gestational age misclassification is an unlikely explanation for the reported 
      divergence in average birth-weights for Aborigines and whites. The results might 
      help with the interpretation of other between-population comparisons.
