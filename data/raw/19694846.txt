AB  - AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to investigate the longitudinal 
      relationship between transformational leadership behaviours and employees' sleep 
      quality, and the mediating effects of self-efficacy. BACKGROUND: Although there 
      is evidence for the influential role of transformational leadership on health 
      outcomes, researchers have used either attitude outcomes (e.g. job satisfaction) 
      or softer health measures, such as general well-being. Specific measures of 
      well-being such as sleep quality have not been used, despite its association with 
      working conditions. METHODS: A longitudinal design was used to collect data from 
      Danish healthcare workers at time 1 in 2005 (n = 447) and 18 months later at time 
      2 in 2007 (n = 274). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the 
      relationships between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and sleep 
      quality at both time points independently (cross-sectionally) and longitudinally. 
      RESULTS: For all constructs, time 2 measures were influenced by the baseline 
      level. Direct relationships between transformational leadership and sleep quality 
      were found. This relationship was negative cross-sectionally at both time points, 
      but positive between baseline and follow-up. The relationship between leadership 
      and employees' sleep quality was not mediated by employees' self-efficacy. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that training managers in transformational 
      leadership behaviours may have a positive impact on healthcare workers' health 
      over time. However, more research is needed to examine the mechanisms by which 
      transformational leadership brings about improved sleep quality; self-efficacy 
      was not found to be the explanation.
