      of mandibular third molars?

AB  - PURPOSE: This investigation assesses the effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel 
      on postoperative pain, swelling, and trismus as well as healing and bone 
      regeneration potential on mandibular third molar extraction sockets. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: A prospective randomized comparative clinical study was undertaken over 
      a 2-year period. Patients requiring surgical extraction of a single impacted 
      third molar and who fell within the inclusion criteria and indicated willingness 
      to return for recall visits were recruited. The predictor variable was 
      application of PRP gel to the socket of the third molar in the test group, 
      whereas the control group had no PRP. The outcome variables were pain, swelling, 
      and maximum mouth opening, which were measured using a 10-point visual analog 
      scale, tape, and millimeter caliper, respectively. Socket healing was assessed 
      radiographically by allocating scores for lamina dura, overall density, and 
      trabecular pattern. Quantitative data were presented as mean. Mann-Whitney test 
      was used to compare means between groups for continuous variables, whereas 
      Fischer exact test was used for categorical variables. Statistical significance 
      was inferred at P < .05. RESULTS: Sixty patients aged 19 to 35 years (mean: 24.7 
      +/- 3.6 years) were divided into both test and control groups of 30 patients each. 
      The mean postoperative pain score (visual analog scale) was lower for the PRP 
      group at all time points and this was statistically significant (P < .05). 
      Although the figures for swelling and interincisal mouth opening were lower in 
      the test group, this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the 
      scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better among 
      patients in the PRP group. This difference was also not statistically 
      significant. CONCLUSION: The PRP group recorded reduced pain, swelling, and 
      trismus as well as enhanced and faster bone healing compared with those in the 
      control. Hence the study showed that topical application of PRP gel has a 
      beneficial effect in enhancing socket healing after third molar surgery.
