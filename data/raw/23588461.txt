AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ascitis and undernutrition are frequent complications of cirrhosis, 
      however ascitis volume and anthropometric assessment are not routinely documented 
      or considered in prognostic evaluation. In a homogeneous cohort followed during 
      two years these variables were scrutinized, aiming to ascertain relevance for 
      longterm outcome. METHODS: Population (N = 25, all males with alcoholic 
      cirrhosis) was recruited among patients hospitalized for uncomplicated ascitis. 
      Exclusion criteria were refractory or tense ascitis, cancer, spontaneous 
      bacterial peritonitis, bleeding varices and critical illness. Measurements 
      included ultrasonographically estimated ascitis volume, dry body mass index/BMI , 
      upper arm anthropometrics, hematologic counts and liver function tests. RESULTS: 
      Population (age 48.3 +/- 11.3 years, BMI 21.1 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2), serum albumin 2.5 +/- 0.8 
      g/dL) was mostly in the Child-Pugh C category (77.8%) but clinically stable. 
      During the follow-up period of 22.6 +/- 3.8 months, additional hospitalizations 
      numbered 1.7 +/- 1.0 and more than one quarter succumbed. Admission ascitis volume 
      corresponded to 7.1 +/- 3.6 L and dry BMI to 18.3 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2). Child Pugh index was 
      relevant for both mortality and rehospitalization. Nevertheless, similar matches 
      for mortality were documented with ascitis volume and dry BMI, and arm 
      circumference below the 5th percentile was highly significantly associated with 
      rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: A greater association than hitherto acknowledged, 
      between ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements from one side, and 
      long-term rehospitalization and mortality from the other, was demonstrated in 
      male stable alcoholic cirrhotics. Further studies with alcoholic and other 
      modalities of cirrhosis including women are recommended.
