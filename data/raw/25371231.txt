TI  - Is vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency related to the development of 
      osteochondritis dissecans?

AB  - PURPOSE: The aetiology of osteochondritis dissecans is still unclear. The aim of 
      this prospective pilot study was to analyse whether vitamin D insufficiency, or 
      deficiency, might be a contributing etiological factor in the development of an 
      OCD lesion. METHODS: The serum level of vitamin D3 in 23 consecutive patients (12 
      male and 11 female) suffering from a stage III, or stages III and IV, OCD lesion 
      (mostly stage III) admitted for surgery was measured. RESULTS: The patients' mean 
      age was 31.3 years and most of them already exhibited closed epiphyseal plates. 
      In the majority of patients (18/23), a distinct vitamin D3 deficiency was found, 
      two patients were vitamin D3-insufficient and, in three patients, the vitamin D3 
      level reached the lowest normal value. CONCLUSION: These first data show that a 
      vitamin D3 deficiency rather than an insufficiency may be involved in the 
      development of OCD lesions. Probably, with a vitamin D3 substitution, the 
      development of an advanced OCD stage could be avoided. Further analyses, 
      including morphological analyses regarding a possible osteomalacia, and 
      examination of the PTH and other determinants of the bone metabolism, should be 
      undertaken to either confirm or refute these data. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.
