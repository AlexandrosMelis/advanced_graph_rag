TI  - Does preloading with colloids prevent hemodynamic changes when neurosurgical 
      patients are subsequently changed to the seated position?
PG  - 247-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was designed to 
      determine and compare the usefulness of preloading colloids (Haemaccel) 10 ml/Kg 
      before positioning whether it can prevent hemodynamic changes during seated 
      positioning or not. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors studied 20 patients by 
      randomly dividing them into 2 groups. The control group was given crystalloid as 
      maintenance and deposit replacement but the study group was given extra colloids 
      10 ml/Kg 30 minutes before starting general anesthesia. Both groups were 
      monitored and given anesthesia, balanced technique. Systolic and diastolic blood 
      pressures, heart rate, central venous pressure (CVP) at different time intervals 
      in the sitting position for 30 minutes were recorded. Statistical analysis was 
      done by Student t-test, Chi-square test and ANOVA (p-value < 0. 05 considered 
      significant). RESULTS: The results showed that systolic blood pressure at 15, 20, 
      30 minutes and CVP at 15, 25, 30 minutes after positioning in the study group was 
      maintained significantly compared to the control group and there were no 
      significant changes in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. There were no 
      other complications during the sitting period. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that 
      preloading colloid fluid prior to repositioning could prevent the decrease of 
      systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure during sitting positioning 
      without other complications.
