TI  - Quaternary cytoreductive surgery in ovarian cancer: does surgical effort still 
      matter?

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate surgical outcome and survival benefit after quaternary 
      cytoreduction (QC) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) relapse. METHODS: We 
      systematically evaluated all consecutive patients undergoing QC in our 
      institution over a 12-year period (October 2000-January 2012). All relevant 
      surgical and clinical outcome parameters were systematically assessed. RESULTS: 
      Forty-nine EOC patients (median age: 57; range: 28-76) underwent QC; in a median 
      of 16 months (range:2-142) after previous chemotherapy. The majority of the 
      patients had an initial FIGO stage III (67.3%), peritoneal carcinomatosis (77.6%) 
      and no ascites (67.3%). At QC, patients presented following tumour pattern: lower 
      abdomen 85.7%; middle abdomen 79.6% and upper abdomen 42.9%. Median duration of 
      surgery was 292 min (range: a total macroscopic tumour clearance could be 
      achieved. Rates of major operative morbidity and 30-day mortality were 28.6% and 
      2%, respectively.Mean follow-up from QC was 18.41 months (95% confidence interval 
      (CI):12.64-24.18) and mean overall survival (OS) 23.05 months (95% CI: 
      15.5-30.6). Mean OS for patients without vs any tumour residuals was 43 months 
      (95% CI: 26.4-59.5) vs 13.4 months (95% CI: 7.42-19.4); P=0.001. Mean OS for 
      patients who received postoperative chemotherapy (n=18; 36.7%) vs those who did 
      not was 40.5 months (95% CI: 27.4-53.6) vs 12.03 months (95% CI: 5.9-18.18); 
      P<0.001.Multivariate analysis indentified multifocal tumour dissemination to be 
      of predictive significance for incomplete tumour resection, higher operative 
      morbidity and lower survival, while systemic chemotherapy subsequent to QC had a 
      protective significant impact on OS. No prognostic impact had ascites, platinum 
      resistance, high grading and advanced age. CONCLUSION: Even in this highly 
      advanced setting of the third EOC relapse, maximal therapeutic effort combining 
      optimal surgery and chemotherapy appear to significantly prolong survival in a 
      selected patients 'group'.
