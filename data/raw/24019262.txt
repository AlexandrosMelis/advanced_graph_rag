AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have suggested inverse relationships between 
      blood pressure and prevalence of conditions such as migraine and headache. It is 
      not yet clear whether similar relationships can be established for back pain in 
      particular in prospective studies. METHODS: Associations between blood pressure 
      and chronic low back pain were explored in the cross-sectional HUNT 2 survey of a 
      Norwegian county in 1995-1997, including 39,872 individuals who never used 
      antihypertensive medication. A prospective study, comprising 17,209 initially 
      back pain-free individuals and 5740 individuals reporting low back pain, was 
      established by re-examinations in the HUNT 3 survey in 2006-2008. Associations 
      were assessed by logistic regression with respect to systolic, diastolic and 
      pulse pressure, with adjustment for education, work status, physical activity, 
      smoking, body mass and lipid levels. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, all 
      three blood pressure measures showed inverse relationships with prevalence of low 
      back pain in both sexes. In the prospective study of disease-free women, baseline 
      pulse pressure and systolic pressure were inversely associated with risk of low 
      back pain [odds ratio (OR) 0.93 per 10 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 0.89-0.98, p = 0.007; OR 0.95 per 10 mm Hg increase in 
      systolic pressure, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p = 0.005]. Results among men were 
      equivocal. No associations were indicated with the occurrence of pain in 
      individuals with low back pain at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Results for low back 
      pain are consistent with the theory of hypertension-associated hypalgesia, 
      predicting diminished pain sensitivity with increasing blood pressure, possibly 
      with modified reactions in people suffering from long-lasting pain.
