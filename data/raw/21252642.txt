      trials?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oncology literature cites that only 2% to 4% of patients participate 
      in research. Up to 85% of patients are unaware that clinical trials research is 
      being conducted at their treatment facility or that they might be eligible to 
      participate. OBJECTIVES: It was hypothesized that patients' satisfaction with 
      information regarding clinical trials would improve after targeted educational 
      interventions, and accruals to clinical trials would increase in the year 
      following those interventions. METHODS: All new patients referred to the cancer 
      center over a 4-month period were mailed a baseline survey to assess their 
      knowledge of clinical research. Subsequently, educational interventions were 
      provided, including an orientation session highlighting clinical trials, a 
      pamphlet, and a reference to a clinical trials Web site. A postintervention 
      survey was sent to the responders of the initial survey 3 months after the 
      initial mailing. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction with information significantly 
      increased after the interventions. There was no increase in subsequent enrollment 
      in clinical trials. Patients who indicated an inclination to participate in 
      clinical trials tended to have greater satisfaction with the information they 
      received. CONCLUSIONS: A set of educational interventions designed for cancer 
      patients significantly improved their satisfaction with information on clinical 
      research, but did not improve clinical trial enrollment of these participants as 
      of 1 year after the study. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The development of 
      educational interventions may be justified, but such interventions may require 
      prolonged implementation to establish benefit. Information relating to research 
      may be most effectively delivered by patients' primary cancer care providers.
