TI  - Does histologic chorioamnionitis correspond to clinical chorioamnionitis?
PG  - 25-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the degree to which histologic chorioamnionitis, a 
      frequent finding in placentas submitted for histopathologic evaluation, 
      correlates with clinical indicators of infection in the mother. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      retrospective review was performed on 52 cases with a histologic diagnosis of 
      acute chorioamnionitis from 2,051 deliveries at University Hospital, Newark, from 
      January 2003 to July 2003. Third-trimester placentas without histologic 
      chorioamnionitis (n = 52) served as controls. Cases and controls were selected 
      sequentially. Maternal medical records were reviewed for indicators of maternal 
      infection. RESULTS: Histologic chorioamnionitis was significantly associated with 
      the usage of antibiotics (p = 0.0095) and a higher mean white blood cell count (p 
      = 0.018). The presence of 1 or more clinical indicators was significantly 
      associated with the presence of histologic chorioamnionitis (p = 0.019). 
      CONCLUSION: Histologic chorioamnionitis is a reliable indicator of infection 
      whether or not it is clinically apparent.
