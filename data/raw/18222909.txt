TI  - Are pectins involved in cold acclimation and de-acclimation of winter oil-seed 
      rape plants?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The hypothesis was tested that pectin content and 
      methylation degree participate in regulation of cell wall mechanical properties 
      and in this way may affect tissue growth and freezing resistance over the course 
      of plant cold acclimation and de-acclimation. METHODS: Experiments were carried 
      on the leaves of two double-haploid lines of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus 
      subsp. oleifera), differing in winter survival and resistance to blackleg fungus 
      (Leptosphaeria maculans). KEY RESULTS: Plant acclimation in the cold (2 degrees 
      C) brought about retardation of leaf expansion, concomitant with development of 
      freezing resistance. These effects were associated with the increases in leaf 
      tensile stiffness, cell wall and pectin contents, pectin methylesterase (EC 
      3.1.1.11) activity and the low-methylated pectin content, independently of the 
      genotype studied. However, the cold-induced modifications in the cell wall 
      properties were more pronounced in the leaves of the more pathogen-resistant 
      genotype. De-acclimation promoted leaf expansion and reversed most of the 
      cold-induced effects, with the exception of pectin methylesterase activity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the temperature-dependent modifications in 
      pectin content and their methyl esterification degree correlate with changes in 
      tensile strength of a leaf tissue, and in this way affect leaf expansion ability 
      and its resistance to freezing and to fungus pathogens.
