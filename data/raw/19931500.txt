AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyze the properties of the immune 
      cell microenvironment of regional lymph nodes (LNs) positive for lung cancer. 
      METHODS: Twenty-four patients operated on for stages T1 and T2 of the NSCLC, were 
      enrolled in the study. Peripheral blood and LN tissue were obtained from 
      different lymph node sites and levels. As a control, LN tissue was taken from 
      patients diagnosed with emphysema or pneumothorax. The cells from randomly chosen 
      LN were tested by multi-color flow cytometry. Separate portions of LN were 
      snap-frozen and examined for the presence of cytokeratin positive cells (CK). 
      Propensity for apoptosis, level of TCR zeta chain expression of T cells and the 
      number and maturation status of dendritic cells were confronted with the presence 
      of CK-positive cells. RESULTS: The presence of metastases correlated with the 
      downregulation of TCR zeta, especially CD8(+) T cells. The most striking feature 
      was the reduction in the number of myeloid CD11c(+) dendritic cells in the LN of 
      patients with LN metastases. This could be a reflection of the immunodeficient 
      state observed in lung cancer patients. Even in the absence of metastases in the 
      regional LN, the same type of changes in the LN microenvironment were observed in 
      those LN located nearer the primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results 
      of this study suggest that this approach may be helpful as an independent tumor 
      staging factor. It is also worth noting that part of the staging process could 
      also be based on features describing the immune cells in the peripheral blood.
