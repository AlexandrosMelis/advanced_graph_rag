AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute pancreatitis is the major complication of endoscopic retrograde 
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure and there are some reports showing 
      cytokine changes in ERCP-induced pancreatits. GOALS: To investigate the 
      association between early changes (within 24 hours) in the serum interleukin 
      (IL)-2, IL-4, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, and IL-6 levels and the 
      development of post-ERCP pancreatitis. STUDY: Forty five consecutive patients who 
      underwent therapeutic ERCP and 10 patients with acute pancreatitis without ERCP 
      were enrolled to the study. Serum concentrations of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and 
      IL-6 were determined immediately before, 12 hours and 24 hours after ERCP. 
      RESULTS: Seven of the 45 patients (15.5%) developed post-ERCP pancreatitis. The 
      levels of IL-4 at 24 hours after ERCP were significantly lower in the patients 
      with post-ERCP pancreatitis than in those without pancreatitis, while TNFalpha 
      levels at 12 hours after ERCP were higher in the complicated group than those of 
      the uncomplicated group. The ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after 
      ERCP were found significantly higher in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis 
      than in those without pancreatitis. IL-6 in the complicated patients was found 
      significantly increased at 24 hours after ERCP. CONCLUSIONS: The enhancement of 
      serum TNFalpha and IL-6 levels in the patients with ERCP-induced pancreatitis 
      reflects the inflammatory activity. Additionally, these cytokines together with 
      IL-4 can be used in clinical laboratory monitoring of ERCP.
