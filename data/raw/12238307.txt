      vaccinations?].

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate, if elderly persons are 
      sufficiently protected against infectious diseases by vaccination. PROBANDS AND 
      METHODS: 300 elderly (> 60 years) and 300 young (< 35 years) persons from five 
      Austrian cities were recruited according to the criteria of a field study. 
      Antibody concentrations against tetanus, diphtheria, tickborne encephalitis and 
      influenza were assessed by ELISA or by haemagglutination inhibition test. Disease 
      and vaccination histories were recorded. RESULTS: The results of the study 
      demonstrate that protection against infectious diseases was frequently 
      insufficient in the elderly. This was partly due to the fact that old persons 
      were not vaccinated according to recommended strategies. However, low antibody 
      concentration and a short duration of protective humoral immunity were also 
      observed in many elderly persons in spite of regular vaccination. This was not 
      only the case in frail, but also in healthy elderlies. CONCLUSION: The data 
      demonstrate that vaccination has a relatively weak and short-lasting effect in 
      old age. The results of the study should stimulate discussions about strategies 
      how vaccinations can be made more effective in old age. Improved campaigns, 
      shortened vaccination intervals as well as the design of novel vaccines tailored 
      to fulfill the specific demands of the aging immune system are imaginable.
