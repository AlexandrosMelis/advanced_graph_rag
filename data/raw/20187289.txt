AB  - PURPOSE: Stock et al. (Eur Respir J 25:47-53, 2005) recently estimated asthma 
      prevalence in Germany using claims data on prescriptions and hospital diagnoses 
      and found high prevalence peaks in infants. Our objective was to critically 
      assess and discuss various aspects of identifying children with asthma using 
      prescription data. METHODS: We replicated the selection procedure of Stock et al. 
      using data on 290,919 children aged 0-17 years insured in the Gmunder ErsatzKasse 
      (GEK) in 2005. Asthma prevalence was also estimated in a sample of 17,641 
      children aged 0-17 years participating in the German Health Interview and 
      Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) from 2003 to 2006. 
      RESULTS: In children aged 0-4 years insured in the GEK, prevalences were found to 
      range from 11.7 to 17.7% for boys and from 7.2 to 11.1% for girls when the 
      criteria of Stock et al. were applied. A steady decline in prevalences was 
      observed in older age groups. Asthma prevalence estimated in the KiGGS data 
      showed a quite different distribution. In the age group 0-4 years, prevalences 
      were found to range from 0 to 2.6% in boys and from 0 to 1.0% in girls; in 
      children >4 years, prevalences were found to increase with increasing age. 
      CONCLUSIONS: When additional validation studies were taken into account, asthma 
      medications were found to be prescribed not only for asthma but also for other 
      respiratory diseases. In addition, not all children with current asthma had 
      prescriptions. We therefore conclude that asthma medications are therefore not a 
      good proxy for the disease.
