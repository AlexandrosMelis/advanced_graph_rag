AB  - BACKGROUND: Women have been reported to show more frequent recanalization and 
      better recovery after intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator 
      (rt-PA) treatment for acute stroke compared with men. To investigate this we 
      studied a series of stroke patients receiving IV rt-PA and undergoing acute 
      transcranial doppler (TCD) examination. METHODS: Acute stroke patients received 
      IV rt-PA and had acute TCD examination within 4 hours of symptom onset at 4 major 
      stroke centers. TCD findings were interpreted using the Thrombolysis in Brain 
      Ischemia (TIBI) flow grading system. The recanalization rates, and poor 3-month 
      outcomes (modified Rankin scale >2) of men and women were compared using the 
      chi-square test. Multiple regression analysis was used to assess sex as a 
      predictor of recanalization and poor 3-month outcome after controlling for age, 
      baseline NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), time to treatment, hypertension, and blood 
      glucose. RESULTS: 369 patients had TCD examinations before or during IV rt-PA 
      treatment. The 199 (53.9%) men and 170 (46.1%) women had mean ages of 67 +/- 13 and 
      70 +/- 14 years, respectively. The sexes did not differ significantly in baseline 
      stroke severity, time to TCD examination, or time to thrombolysis. Of the men, 68 
      (34.2%) had complete recanalization, 58 (29.1%) had partial recanalization, and 
      73 (36.6%) had no recanalization. Of the women, 53 (31.2%) had complete 
      recanalization, 46 (27%) had partial recanalization, and 71 (41.8%) had no 
      recanalization (p = 0.6). Multiple regression analyses showed no difference 
      between the sexes in recanalization rate, time to recanalization, or clinical 
      outcome at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: In our study; sex is not a significant 
      predictor of recanalization rate, time to recanalization or 3-month outcome in 
      stroke patients following IV rt-PA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Data from CLOTBUST trial
