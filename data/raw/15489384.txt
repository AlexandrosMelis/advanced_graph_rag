TI  - Does reducing spasticity translate into functional benefit? An exploratory 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 1547-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spasticity and loss of function in an affected arm are common after 
      stroke. Although botulinum toxin is used to reduce spasticity, its functional 
      benefits are less easily demonstrated. This paper reports an exploratory 
      meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between reduced arm spasticity and 
      improved arm function. METHOD: Individual data from stroke patients in two 
      randomised controlled trials of intra-muscular botulinum toxin were pooled. The 
      Modified Ashworth Scale (elbow, wrist, fingers) was used to calculate a 
      "Composite Spasticity Index". Data from the arm section of the Barthel Activities 
      of Daily Living Index (dressing, grooming, and feeding) and three subjective 
      measures (putting arm through sleeve, cleaning palm, cutting fingernails) were 
      summed to give a "Composite Functional Index". Change scores and the time of 
      maximum change were also calculated. RESULTS: Maximum changes in both composite 
      measures occurred concurrently in 47 patients. In 26 patients the improvement in 
      spasticity preceded the improvement in function with 18 showing the reverse. 
      There was a definite relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and 
      the maximum change in arm function, independent of treatment (rho = -0.2822, p = 
      0.0008, n = 137). There was a clear relationship between the changes in 
      spasticity and in arm function in patients treated with botulinum toxin (Dysport) 
      at 500 or 1000 units (rho = -0.5679, p = 0.0090, n = 22; rho = -0.4430, p = 
      0.0018, n = 47), but not in those treated with placebo or 1500 units. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Using a targeted meta-analytic approach, it is possible to 
      demonstrate that reducing spasticity in the arm is associated with a significant 
      improvement in arm function.
