TI  - Does lunar position influence the time of delivery? A statistical analysis.
PG  - 47-50
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between lunar position and the day of 
      delivery; to investigate the synodic distribution of spontaneous deliveries, 
      especially in relation to the presence of a full moon. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Retrospective analysis of 1248 spontaneous full-term deliveries in three-year 
      period (36 lunar months), setted at Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, 
      Civil Hospital, Fano (Marche, Italy), using circular statistics techniques. 
      RESULTS: A connection between the distribution of spontaneous full-term 
      deliveries and the lunar month was found. The effect of the phases of the moon 
      seems to be particularly relevant in multiparae and plurigravidae; in these 
      cases, the mean day of delivery corresponds to the first or second day after the 
      full moon. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper the effect of lunar phases on the time of 
      delivery is shown. This influence seems to be especially relevant in the case of 
      multiparae and plurigravidae. Nevertheless, it is too weak to allow for 
      prediction regarding the days with the highest frequency of deliveries.
