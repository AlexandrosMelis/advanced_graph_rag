AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether problems in instrumental activities of daily 
      living (IADL) can add to conventionally used clinical measurements in helping to 
      predict a diagnosis of dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up. DESIGN: Multicenter 
      prospective cohort study. SETTING: Memory clinics in Europe. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Individuals aged 55 and older without dementia. MEASUREMENTS: IADLs were measured 
      using pooled activities from five informant-based questionnaires. Structural 
      equation modeling (SEM) was used to investigate the relation between IADLs and 
      dementia. Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental 
      State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model. RESULTS: Five 
      hundred thirty-one participants had baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments; 69 
      (13.0%) of these had developed dementia at 1-year follow-up. At 2-year follow-up, 
      481 participants were seen, of whom 100 (20.8%) had developed dementia. 
      Participants with IADL disabilities at baseline had a higher conversion rate 
      (24.4%) than participants without IADL disabilities (16.7%) (chi-square = 4.28, 
      degrees of freedom = 1, P = .04). SEM showed that IADL disability could help 
      predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds 
      ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up 
      (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.33-3.33). CONCLUSION: IADL disability is a useful addition 
      to the diagnostic process in a memory clinic setting, indicating who is at higher 
      risk of developing dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-up.
