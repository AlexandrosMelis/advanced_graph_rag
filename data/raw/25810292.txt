      applicable in routine surgery?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Traditional resectional techniques and chordal transfer are difficult 
      to apply in video-assisted mitral valve repair. Using artificial chords appears 
      easier in this setting. The purpose of this study was to review the effectiveness 
      and reproducibility of neochordal repair as a routine approach to minimally 
      invasive mitral repair, and to assess the stability of neochord implantation 
      using the figure-of-eight suture without pledgets in this setting. METHODS: This 
      is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent minimally invasive 
      video-assisted mitral valve repair from 2008 to 2013. The primary endpoints were 
      recurrent mitral regurgitation and reoperation. RESULTS: A total of 426 
      consecutive patients were included during the study period, with a mean age of 55 
      +/- 18 years. Neochords were used in all patients, and in association with leaflet 
      resection in 47 patients. One patient was not repairable and underwent valve 
      replacement (repair rate, 99.8%). Fifteen patients had Grade I (3.5%) 
      regurgitation, whereas the remainder had none. Patients were fast-tracked, with 
      25% extubated in the operation theatre and the remainder within 6 h. There were 5 
      deaths within 30 days (1.2%). Follow-up ranged 3-60 months, during which all of 
      the patients remained with no or trace mitral regurgitation. No de-insertion or 
      rupture of any neochords was found, and no patients required a reoperation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive mitral valve repair using neochords provided a 
      high rate of repair, reproducible results in a routine cardiac surgery setting 
      and stable repair during follow-up. This has become our preferred technique for 
      mitral valve surgery.
