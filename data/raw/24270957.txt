TI  - Is combined therapy more effective than growth hormone or hyperbaric oxygen alone 
      in the healing of left ischemic and non-ischemic colonic anastomoses?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate the effects of growth hormone (GH), 
      hyperbaric oxygen and combined therapy on normal and ischemic colonic anastomoses 
      in rats. METHODS: Eighty male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups 
      (n = 10). In the first four groups, non-ischemic colonic anastomosis was 
      performed, whereas in the remaining four groups, ischemic colonic anastomosis was 
      performed. In groups 5, 6, 7, and 8, colonic ischemia was established by ligating 
      2 cm of the mesocolon on either side of the anastomosis. The control groups (1 
      and 5) received no treatment. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy was initiated immediately 
      after surgery and continued for 4 days in groups 3 and 4. Groups 2 and 6 received 
      recombinant human growth hormone, whereas groups 4 and 8 received GH and 
      hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Relaparotomy was performed on postoperative day 4, 
      and a perianastomotic colon segment 2 cm in length was excised for the detection 
      of biochemical and mechanical parameters of anastomotic healing and 
      histopathological evaluation. RESULTS: Combined treatment with hyperbaric oxygen 
      and GH increased the mean bursting pressure values in all of the groups, and a 
      statistically significant increase was noted in the ischemic groups compared to 
      the controls (p<0.05). This improvement was more evident in the ischemic and 
      normal groups treated with combined therapy. In addition, a histopathological 
      evaluation of anastomotic neovascularization and collagen deposition showed 
      significant differences among the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined treatment with 
      recombinant human growth hormone and hyperbaric oxygen resulted in a favorable 
      therapeutic effect on the healing of ischemic colonic anastomoses.
