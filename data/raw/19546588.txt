AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the mechanism of muscle wasting in end-stage renal disease 
      is not fully understood, there is increasing evidence that acidosis induces 
      muscle protein degradation and could therefore contribute to the loss of muscle 
      protein stores of patients on hemodialysis, a prototypical state of chronic 
      metabolic acidosis (CMA). Because body protein mass is controlled by the balance 
      between synthesis and degradation, protein loss can occur as result of either 
      increased breakdown, impaired synthesis, or both. Correction of acidosis may 
      therefore help to maintain muscle mass and improve the health of patients with 
      CMA. We evaluated whether alkalizing patients on hemodialysis might have a 
      positive effect on protein synthesis and on nutritional parameters. METHODS: 
      Eight chronic hemodialysis patients were treated daily with oral sodium 
      bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) supplementation for 10-14 days, yielding a pre-dialytic 
      plasma bicarbonate concentration of 28.6 +/-1.6 mmol/l. The fractional synthesis 
      rates (FSR) of muscle protein and albumin were obtained by the 
      L-[(2)H(5)ring]phenylalanine flooding technique. RESULTS: Oral NaHCO(3 
      )supplementation induced a significant increase in serum bicarbonate (21.5 +/- 
      3.4 vs. 28.6 +/- 1.6 mmol/l; p = 0.018) and blood pH (7.41 vs. 7.46; p = 0.041). 
      The FSR of muscle protein and the FSR of albumin did not change significantly 
      (muscle protein: 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.5% per day, p = 0.39; albumin: 8.3 +/- 
      2.2 vs. 8.6 +/- 2.5% per day, p = 0.31). Plasma concentrations of insulin-like 
      growth factor 1 decreased significantly (33.4 +/- 21.3 vs. 25.4 +/- 12.3 nmol/l; 
      p = 0.028), whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxin and free 
      triiodothyronine did not change significantly and nutritional parameters showed 
      no improvement. CONCLUSION: In contrast to other findings, raising the blood pH 
      of dialysis patients was not associated with a positive effect on albumin and 
      muscle protein synthesis, or nutritional and endocrinal parameters.
