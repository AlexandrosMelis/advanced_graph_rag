TI  - Is a mandatory general surgery rotation necessary in the surgical clerkship?
PG  - 515-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Changes in the spectrum of general surgery and the delivery of 
      surgical care have placed the requirement for a mandatory general surgery 
      rotation in the surgical clerkship in question. METHODS: We tested the hypothesis 
      that equal mastery of surgical clerkship objectives can be obtained in a 
      clerkship with and without general surgery. Students chose any two surgical 
      rotations and were assessed by written examination, objective structured clinical 
      examination (OSCE), ward evaluations, self-assessment objectives questionnaire, 
      and satisfaction survey. RESULTS: Data for 54 students showed no differences in 
      scores between groups on any parameter. No specific concerns related to the 
      absence of general surgery were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Effective undergraduate 
      surgical education can be offered in many specialty settings. Removal of the 
      requirement for general surgery in clerkship may lead to a more effective use of 
      all educational opportunities. A careful analysis of local programs and 
      facilities is necessary before suggesting this change to other institutions.
