TI  - Do older patients who refuse to participate in a self-management intervention in 
      the Netherlands differ from older patients who agree to participate?
PG  - 266-71
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Refusal of patients to participate in intervention programs 
      is an important problem in clinical trials but, in general, researchers devote 
      relatively little attention to it. In this article, a comparison is made between 
      patients who, after having been invited, agreed to participate in a 
      self-management intervention (participants) and those who refused (refusers). 
      Compared with other studies of refusers, relatively more information could be 
      gathered with regard to both their characteristics and reasons for refusing, 
      because all potential participants were invited personally. METHODS: Older 
      patients from a Dutch outpatient clinic were invited to participate in a 
      self-management intervention, and their characteristics were assessed. 
      Demographic data were collected, as well as data on physical functioning and lack 
      of emotional support. People who refused to participate were asked to give their 
      reasons for refusing. RESULTS: Of the 361 patients invited, 267 (74%) refused 
      participation. These refusers were more restricted in their mobility, lived 
      further away from the location of the intervention, and had a partner more often 
      than did the participants. No differences were found in level of education, age 
      or gender. The main reasons given by respondents for refusing to participate were 
      lack of time, travel distance, and transport problems. CONCLUSIONS: As in many 
      studies, the refusal rate in this study is high, and seems to be related to 
      physical mobility restrictions, travel distance and, partly, to availability of 
      emotional support. These findings may be used to make the recruitment process 
      more effective - for example, by offering transport to the location of the 
      intervention.
