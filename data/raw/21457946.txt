AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well established that schizophrenia is associated with 
      structural brain abnormalities, but whether these are static or progress over 
      time remains controversial. METHODS: A systematic review of longitudinal 
      volumetric studies using region-of-interest structural magnetic resonance imaging 
      in patients with schizophrenia and healthy control subjects. The percentage 
      change in volume between scans for each brain region of interest was obtained, 
      and data were combined using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven 
      studies were included in the meta-analysis, with 928 patients and 867 control 
      subjects, and 32 different brain regions of interest. Subjects with schizophrenia 
      showed significantly greater decreases over time in whole brain volume, whole 
      brain gray matter, frontal gray and white matter, parietal white matter, and 
      temporal white matter volume, as well as larger increases in lateral ventricular 
      volume, than healthy control subjects. The time between baseline and follow-up 
      magnetic resonance imaging scans ranged from 1 to 10 years. The differences 
      between patients and control subjects in annualized percentage volume change were 
      -.07% for whole brain volume, -.59% for whole brain gray matter, -.32% for 
      frontal white matter, -.32% for parietal white matter, -.39% for temporal white 
      matter, and +.36% for bilateral lateral ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      suggest that schizophrenia is associated with progressive structural brain 
      abnormalities, affecting both gray and white matter. We found no evidence to 
      suggest progressive medial temporal lobe involvement but did find evidence that 
      this may be partly explained by heterogeneity between studies in patient age and 
      illness duration. The causes and clinical correlates of these progressive brain 
      changes should now be the focus of investigation.
