      increased in children having atopic dermatitis?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous infections such as impetigo contagiosum (IC), molluscum 
      contagiosum (MC) and herpes virus infection (HI) appear to be associated with 
      atopic dermatitis (AD), but there are no reports of concrete epidemiological 
      evidence. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of childhood AD with these 
      infections by conducting a population-based cross-sectional study. METHODS: 
      Enrolled in this study were 1117 children aged 0-6 years old attending nursery 
      schools in Ishigaki City, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Physical examination was 
      performed by dermatologists, and a questionnaire was completed on each child's 
      history of allergic diseases including AD, asthma, allergic rhinitis and egg 
      allergy, and that of skin infections including IC, MC and HI, as well as familial 
      history of AD. RESULTS: In 913 children (AD; 132), a history of IC, MC or HI was 
      observed in 45.1%, 19.7%, and 2.5%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression 
      analysis revealed that the odds of having a history of IC were 1.8 times higher 
      in AD children than in non-AD children. Meanwhile, a history of MC was 
      significantly correlated to the male gender, but not to a personal history of AD. 
      As for HI, we found no correlated factors in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      lifetime prevalence of IC was indeed higher in young children with a history of 
      AD.
