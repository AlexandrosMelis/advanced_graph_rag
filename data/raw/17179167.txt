TI  - Human papillomavirus and pterygium. Is the virus a risk factor?
PG  - 1016-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pterygium is a disease of unknown origin and pathogenesis that might 
      be vision threatening. It is characterised by a wing-like conjunctival overgrowth 
      of the cornea. Several studies have investigated human papillomavirus (HPV) as a 
      risk factor for the development of pterygia, but the results are inconclusive. 
      AIM: To investigate a large sample of pterygia for the presence of HPV in order 
      to clarify the putative association between pterygia and HPV. METHODS: 100 
      specimens of pterygium from Danish patients and 20 normal conjunctival biopsy 
      specimens were investigated for the presence of HPV with PCR technique using 
      beta-globin primers to access the quality of the extracted DNA and the HPV 
      primers MY09/11 and GP5+/6+. HPV-positive specimens underwent subsequent HPV 
      typing with type-specific HPV primers and further investigation with DNA in situ 
      hybridisation (ISH). RESULTS: 90 of 100 investigated pterygia proved suitable for 
      HPV analysis by PCR. As beta-globin could not be amplified, 10 specimens were 
      excluded from the study. 4 of 90 pterygia harboured HPV. HPV type 6 was 
      identified in all four HPV-positive pterygia. The 20 normal conjunctival biopsy 
      specimens were beta-globin positive and HPV negative. All four pterygia that were 
      HPV type 6 positive were DNA ISH negative. CONCLUSIONS: The low presence of HPV 
      DNA in pterygia does not support the hypothesis that HPV is involved in the 
      development of pterygia in Denmark.
