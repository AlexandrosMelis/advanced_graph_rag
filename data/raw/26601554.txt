AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of viral infection in benign paroxysmal 
      positional vertigo (BPPV). METHODS: In this retrospective study, 483 patients 
      with BPPV were included in the study group. The control group consisted of 461 
      healthy subjects. In both groups, serologic analysis of viral agents (HSV1, HSV2, 
      Herpes zoster, EBV, CMV, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus) was 
      performed. RESULTS: With the exception of influenza and parainfluenza, all viral 
      serology values were higher in the BBPV group than the control group. We also 
      observed seasonal variation. The BPPV group exhibited elevated values for HSV1 
      and adenovirus in March and May, for Herpes zoster, adenovirus, and influenza in 
      April, for HSV1 in June, and for HSV1 and CMV in September, compared to the 
      control group. In October, the BPPV group showed increased values for all of the 
      viruses studied, compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: BPPV is associated 
      with positive viral serology, particularly during certain months of the year, 
      mainly in spring and autumn. Viral infection might promote BPPV attacks due to 
      the development of vestibulopathy or induce secondary BPPV via viral 
      infection-related neurolabyrinthitis.
