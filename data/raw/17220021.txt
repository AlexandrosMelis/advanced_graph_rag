      in northern Israel?].

AB  - BACKGROUND: Group B Streptococci (GBS) asymptomatically colonize the vaginal or 
      rectal areas of about 20% of pregnant women (4-40%). About 50% of infants to 
      mothers with GBS colonization also become colonized at rectal, umbilical or oral 
      sites. GBS is a leading bacterial cause of neonatal illness and death. The 
      present prevalence rate of GBS carriers among parturients in the western Galilee 
      in Israel is unknown. AIM: A prospective study of the GBS carrier rate according 
      to origin and gestational age in the western Galilee in Israel. METHODS: A 
      prospective study including 700 pregnant women. All women were screened for 
      carriage of GBS by vaginal and rectal cultures. RESULTS: Sixteen percent of the 
      parturients were found to be GBS colonized. The prevalence of GBS was 13.7% in 
      Jewish women and 19% in Arab women, P=0.038. The women were also divided into two 
      groups according to the gestational age one group included 414 women in 24-37 
      weeks gestation, and the other group included 286 women in term pregnancy. No 
      difference was found in the rate of GBS carriers between the two gestational age 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study we found a significant increase in the 
      incidence of GBS colonization in pregnant women in northern Israel. We also found 
      an increased rate of GBS carriers in Arab women relative to Jewish women.
