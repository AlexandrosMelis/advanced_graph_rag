TI  - The use of audit to identify maternal mortality in different settings: is it just 
      a difference between the rich and the poor?
PG  - 133-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To illustrate how maternal mortality audit identifies different causes 
      of and contributing factors to maternal deaths in different settings in low- and 
      high-income countries and how this can lead to local solutions in reducing 
      maternal deaths. DESIGN: Descriptive study of maternal mortality from different 
      settings and review of data on the history of reducing maternal mortality in what 
      are now high-income countries. SETTINGS: Kalabo district in Zambia, Farafenni 
      division in The Gambia, Onandjokwe district in Namibia, and the Netherlands. 
      POPULATION: Population of rural areas in Zambia and The Gambia, peri-urban 
      population in Namibia and nationwide data from The Netherlands. METHODS: Data 
      from facility-based maternal mortality audits from three African hospitals and 
      data from the latest confidential enquiry in The Netherlands. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Maternal mortality ratio (MMR), causes (direct and indirect) and 
      characteristics. RESULTS: MMR ranged from 10 per 100,000 (the Netherlands) to 
      1540 per 100,000 (The Gambia). Differences in causes of deaths were characterized 
      by HIV/AIDS in Namibia, sepsis and HIV/AIDS in Zambia, (pre-)eclampsia in the 
      Netherlands and obstructed labour in The Gambia. CONCLUSION: Differences in 
      maternal mortality are more than just differences between the rich and poor. 
      Acknowledging the magnitude of maternal mortality and harnessing a strong 
      political will to tackle the issues are important factors. However, there is no 
      single, general solution to reduce maternal mortality, and identification of 
      problems needs to be promoted through audit, both national and local.
