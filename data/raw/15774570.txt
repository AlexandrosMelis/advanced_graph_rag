TI  - Does increased use of private health care reduce the demand for NHS care? A 
      prospective survey of general practice referrals.
PG  - 182-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of the private sector for health care is increasing, but it 
      is unclear whether this will reduce demand on the NHS. The aim of this study was 
      to examine the relationship between private and NHS outpatient referral rates 
      accounting for their association with deprivation. METHODS: This is a prospective 
      survey of general practitioner referrals to private and NHS consultant-led 
      services between 1 January and 31 December 2001 from 10 general practices in the 
      Trent Focus Collaborative Research Network, United Kingdom. Patient referrals 
      were aggregated to give private and NHS referral rates for each electoral ward in 
      each practice. RESULTS: Of 17,137 referrals, 90.4 percent (15,495) were to the 
      NHS and 9.6 percent (1642) to the private sector. Private referral rates were 
      lower in patients from the most deprived fifth of wards compared with the least 
      deprived fifth (rate ratio 0.25, 95 percent CI 0.15 to 0.41, p < 0.001), whereas 
      NHS referral rates were slightly higher in patients in the most deprived fifth of 
      wards (rate ratio 1.18, 95 percent CI 0.98 to 1.42, p = 0.08) both after age 
      standardisation and adjustment for practice. The NHS referral rate was 
      significantly higher (rate ratio 1.40, 95 percent CI 1.15 to 1.71, p = 0.001) in 
      wards with private referral rates in the top fifth compared with the bottom fifth 
      after adjustment for deprivation and practice. CONCLUSIONS: Increased private 
      health care activity does not reduce the demand for NHS care: NHS and private 
      referral rates were positively associated with each other after adjusting for 
      age, deprivation and practice.
