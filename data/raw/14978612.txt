TI  - Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer? A 
      prospective assessment.
PG  - 451-8
AB  - PURPOSE: The influence of positron emission tomography in the management of 
      recurrent rectal cancer is well established but its role in primary rectal cancer 
      remains uncertain. This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of 
      position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer. 
      METHODS: Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for 
      consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission 
      tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each 
      patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan 
      prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with 
      subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of 
      position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical 
      follow-up. RESULTS: The surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was 
      unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position 
      emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged 
      disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management 
      was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 
      6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) 
      in which the radiotherapy field was changed. Where available, follow-up confirmed 
      the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced management change in 
      each case. Two patients had a change in therapy independent of the position 
      emission tomography scan due to clinical circumstances. Overall tumor stage was 
      changed following position emission tomography in 18 of 46 patients (39 percent). 
      CONCLUSION: Position emission tomography scanning appears to accurately change 
      the stage or appropriately alter the therapy of almost a third of patients with 
      advanced primary rectal cancer. In view of this, we suggest that position 
      emission tomography scanning be considered part of standard workup for such 
      patients, particularly if neoadjuvant chemoradiation is being considered as part 
      of primary management.
