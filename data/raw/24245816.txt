TI  - Is trabecular bone related to primary stability of miniscrews?
PG  - 500-7
LID - 10.2319/052513-39.1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the primary stability of miniscrews inserted into bone 
      blocks of different bone mineral densities (BMDs) with and without cortical bone, 
      and investigate whether some trabecular properties could influence primary 
      stability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two bone blocks were extracted from fresh 
      bovine pelvic bone. Four groups were created based on bone type (iliac or pubic 
      region) and presence or absence of cortical bone. Specimens were micro-computed 
      tomography imaged to evaluate trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular 
      separation, bone volume density (BV/TV), BMD, and cortical thickness. Miniscrews 
      1.4 mm in diameter and 6 mm long were inserted into the bone blocks, and primary 
      stability was evaluated by insertion torque (IT), mini-implant mobility (PTV), 
      and pull-out strength (PS). RESULTS: Intergroup comparison showed lower levels of 
      primary stability when the BMD of trabecular bone was lower and in the absence of 
      cortical bone (P</=.05). The Pearson correlation test showed correlation between 
      trabecular number, trabecular thickness, BV/TV, trabecular BMD, total BMD, and 
      IT, PTV, and PS. There was correlation between cortical thickness and IT and PS 
      (P</=.05). CONCLUSION: Cancellous bone plays an important role in primary stability 
      of mini-implants in the presence or absence of cortical bone.
