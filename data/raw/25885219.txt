AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregnancy induces adaptations in maternal metabolism to meet the 
      increased need for nutrients by the placenta and fetus. Creatine is an important 
      intracellular metabolite obtained from the diet and also synthesised 
      endogenously. Experimental evidence suggests that the fetus relies on a maternal 
      supply of creatine for much of gestation. However, the impact of pregnancy on 
      maternal creatine homeostasis is unclear. We hypothesise that alteration of 
      maternal creatine homeostasis occurs during pregnancy to ensure adequate levels 
      of this essential substrate are available for maternal tissues, the placenta and 
      fetus. This study aimed to describe maternal creatine homeostasis from mid to 
      late gestation in the precocial spiny mouse. METHODS: Plasma creatine 
      concentration and urinary excretion were measured from mid to late gestation in 
      pregnant (n = 8) and age-matched virgin female spiny mice (n = 6). At term, body 
      composition and organ weights were assessed and tissue total creatine content 
      determined. mRNA expression of the creatine synthesising enzymes arginine:glycine 
      amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), and the 
      creatine transporter (CrT1) were assessed by RT-qPCR. Protein expression of AGAT 
      and GAMT was also assessed by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Plasma creatine and 
      renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation (P < 
      0.001, P < 0.05, respectively). Pregnancy resulted in increased lean tissue (P < 
      0.01), kidney (P < 0.01), liver (P < 0.01) and heart (P < 0.05) mass at term. 
      CrT1 expression was increased in the heart (P < 0.05) and skeletal muscle (P < 
      0.05) at term compared to non-pregnant tissues, and creatine content of the heart 
      (P < 0.05) and kidney (P < 0.001) were also increased at this time. CrT1 mRNA 
      expression was down-regulated in the liver (<0.01) and brain (<0.01) of pregnant 
      spiny mice at term. Renal AGAT mRNA (P < 0.01) and protein (P < 0.05) expression 
      were both significantly up-regulated at term, with decreased expression of AGAT 
      mRNA (<0.01) and GAMT protein (<0.05) observed in the term pregnant heart. Brain 
      AGAT (<0.01) and GAMT (<0.001) mRNA expression were also decreased at term. 
      CONCLUSION: Change of maternal creatine status (increased creatine synthesis and 
      reduced creatine excretion) may be a necessary adjustment of maternal physiology 
      to pregnancy to meet the metabolic demands of maternal tissues, the placenta and 
      developing fetus.
