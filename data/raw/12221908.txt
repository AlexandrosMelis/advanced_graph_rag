AB  - INTRODUCTION: The principal causes of morbidity and mortality during pregnancy in 
      Mexico, are preeclampsia/eclampsia, obstetric hemorrhage and puerperium 
      complications; this is, 62% of maternal deaths in last years. HELLP syndrome was 
      observed between 5 to 25% of the mortality in pregnancies of 36 weeks or less. 
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze patients with HELLP syndrome in ICU's (Intensive Care Unit) 
      of a Gynecology and Obstetric Hospital, related to the abnormal hematological, 
      hepatic and renal results with the obstetric case history and the clinical 
      complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A transversal study in patients with HELLP 
      syndrome during 1998 and 1999 were carry out. CASE DEFINITION: Peripheral blood 
      with Microangiopathic hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes: AST, ALT over 40 UI/L, 
      even when were LDH lower than 600 UI/L. It was evaluated the hepatic and renal 
      function, platelets count, microangiopathic hemolysis, arterial pressure, 
      seizures, icteric skin color, blindness, visual disturbances, nausea, vomiting 
      and upper quadrant right abdominal pain. In newborn we analyzed gestational age, 
      sex, weight and APGAR. We studied for an association between maternal and 
      biochemical variables with Correlation Pearson Test, and dependence between 
      variables with lineal regression model. RESULTS: 2878 patients with hypertensives 
      disorders in pregnancy (11.64%). The 1.15% (n = 33) had HELLP syndrome with 
      specific maternal mortality of 0.4 per 10,000 live birth, perinatal mortality of 
      1.62 per 10,000 live birth; and renal damage in 84.5%. Coefficient beta was 
      higher between number of pregnancies to platelets count (-0.33) and creatinine 
      clearance (-0.401). CONCLUSION: We found an important renal damage, low 
      platelets, elevated liver enzymes in women with two or more pregnancies. Then we 
      propose there are similarities between HELLP syndrome and Systemic Inflammatory 
      Response Syndrome (SIRS) because they could have the same pathophysiology.
