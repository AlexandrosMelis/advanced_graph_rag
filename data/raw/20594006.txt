      correction?

AB  - OBJECT: Tethering of the spinal cord is thought to increase the chance of 
      neurological injury when scoliosis correction is undertaken. All patients with 
      myelomeningocele (MM) are radiographically tethered, and untethering procedures 
      carry significant morbidity risks including worsening neurological function and 
      wound complications. No guidelines exist as regards untethering in patients with 
      MM prior to scoliosis correction surgery. The authors' aim in this study was to 
      evaluate their experience in patients with MM who were not untethered before 
      scoliosis correction. METHODS: Seventeen patients with MM were retrospectively 
      identified and 1) had no evidence of a clinically symptomatic tethered cord, 2) 
      had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, and 3) had not been 
      untethered for at least 1 year prior to surgery. The minimum follow-up after 
      fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or 
      shunt complications in the perioperative period. RESULTS: The average age of the 
      patients was 12.4 years, and the following neurological levels were affected: 
      T-12 and above, 7 patients; L-1/L-2, 6 patients; L-3, 2 patients; and L-4, 2 
      patients. All were radiographically tethered as confirmed on MR imaging. Fourteen 
      of the patients (82%) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The mean Cobb angle was 
      corrected from 82 degrees to 35 degrees , for a 57% correction. All patients 
      underwent neuromonitoring of their upper extremities, and some underwent lower 
      extremity monitoring as well. Postoperatively, no patient experienced a new 
      cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper 
      extremity weakness/sensory loss. One patient had transient lower extremity 
      weakness, which returned to baseline within 1 month of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      study results suggested that spinal cord untethering may be unnecessary in 
      patients with MM who are undergoing scoliosis corrective surgery and do not 
      present with clinical symptoms of a tethered cord, even though tethering is 
      radiographically demonstrated.
