TI  - Are head and neck specific quality of life measures necessary?
PG  - 474-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether head and 
      neck-specific health status domains are distinct from those assessed by general 
      measures of quality-of-life (QOL). METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 55 head and 
      neck cancer patients in tertiary academic center was made. Three head and 
      neck-specific measures,-including the Head & Neck Survey (H&NS); a brief, 
      multi-item test which generates domain scores; and a general health measure,-were 
      administered. RESULTS: The H&NS was highly reliable and more strongly correlated 
      to the specific measures than to the general measure. Eating/swallowing (ES) and 
      speech/communication (SC) were not well correlated with general health domains. 
      Head and neck pain was highly correlated to general bodily pain (0.88, p < 
      .0001). Despite correlations to some general health domains, appearance (AP) was 
      not fully reflected by any other domain. CONCLUSIONS: Head and neck-specific QOL 
      measures are necessary and should include domains that reflect ES, SC, and AP.
