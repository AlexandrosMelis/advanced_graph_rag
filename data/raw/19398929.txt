AB  - GOALS: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the growth rate of a 
      gallbladder (GB) polyp is a predictive indicator for neoplastic polyps. 
      BACKGROUND: Cholecystectomy for GB polyps that are larger than 10 mm is generally 
      recommended because of the high probability of neoplasm. In contrast, a follow-up 
      strategy is preferred for GB polyps smaller than 10 mm. However, there are no 
      treatment guidelines for polyps that grow in size during the follow-up period. 
      STUDY: We retrospectively investigated 145 patients with GB polyps who underwent 
      at least 1 ultrasonographic follow-up examination over an interval greater than 6 
      months, before cholecystectomy at Samsung medical center, South Korea, from 1994 
      to 2007. The growth rate was determined based on the change in size per time 
      interval between 2 ultrasonographic examinations (mm/mo). RESULTS: The median age 
      of the patients was 48 years (range: 25 to 75). One hundred twenty-five 
      non-neoplastic polyps and 20 neoplastic polyps were found. Neoplastic polyps were 
      more frequently found in patients older than 60 years, those with hypertension, a 
      polyp size greater than 10 mm, and a rapid growth rate greater than 0.6 mm/mo. On 
      multivariate analysis, however, the growth rate was not related to the neoplastic 
      nature of a polyp, but older age (>60 y) and large size (>10 mm) were 
      significantly associated with neoplastic polyps. CONCLUSIONS: Patient's age (>60 
      y) and large polyp size (>10 mm) were significant predictive factors for 
      neoplastic GB polyps. GB polyps less than 10 mm in diameter do not require 
      surgical intervention simply because they grow.
