      universal coverage?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 58th World Health Assembly called for all health systems to move 
      towards universal coverage where everyone has access to key promotive, 
      preventive, curative and rehabilitative health interventions at an affordable 
      cost. Universal coverage involves ensuring that health care benefits are 
      distributed on the basis of need for care and not on ability to pay. The 
      distribution of health care benefits is therefore an important policy question, 
      which health systems should address. The aim of this study is to assess the 
      distribution of health care benefits in the Kenyan health system, compare changes 
      over two time periods and demonstrate the extent to which the distribution meets 
      the principles of universal coverage. METHODS: Two nationally representative 
      cross-sectional households surveys conducted in 2003 and 2007 were the main 
      sources of data. A comprehensive analysis of the entire health system is 
      conducted including the public sector, private-not-for-profit and 
      private-for-profit sectors. Standard benefit incidence analysis techniques were 
      applied and adopted to allow application to private sector services. RESULTS: The 
      three sectors recorded similar levels of pro-rich distribution in 2003, but in 
      2007, the private-not-for-profit sector was pro-poor, public sector benefits 
      showed an equal distribution, while the private-for-profit sector remained 
      pro-rich. Larger pro-rich disparities were recorded for inpatient compared to 
      outpatient benefits at the hospital level, but primary health care services were 
      pro-poor. Benefits were distributed on the basis of ability to pay and not on 
      need for care. CONCLUSIONS: The principles of universal coverage require that all 
      should benefit from health care according to need. The Kenyan health sector is 
      clearly inequitable and benefits are not distributed on the basis of need. 
      Deliberate efforts should be directed to restructuring the Kenyan health system 
      to address access barriers and ensure that all Kenyans benefit from health care 
      when they need it.
