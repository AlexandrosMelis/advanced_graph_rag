TI  - Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans: is it a growth disturbance of the secondary 
      physis of the epiphysis?

LID - 10.2214/AJR.11.8085 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary physis is responsible for longitudinal bone growth. 
      Similarly, epiphysial growth relies on endochondral ossification from the 
      circumferential secondary physeal [corrected]. injury can result in disruption of 
      normal ossification. The cause of juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) 
      remains elusive. We hypothesized that juvenile OCD results from an insult 
      affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis. The purpose of our 
      study was to evaluate the MRI appearance of the distal femoral 
      epiphysis-particularly the secondary physis-of children with juvenile OCD and to 
      compare these findings with the MRI findings of unaffected children. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Knee MRI examinations of 30 children (age range, 8 years 8 months to 
      13 years 4 months) with OCD and 30 matched control patients were evaluated for 
      skeletal maturity; location of the OCD lesion, if present; secondary physeal 
      [corrected] continuity; overlying chondroepiphysial integrity, contour, and 
      width; signal intensity of subchondral bone; and secondary physeal [corrected] 
      conspicuity. Variables were compared using chi-square tests. RESULTS: All 
      children were skeletally immature. Condylar lesions were medial in 24 knees and 
      lateral in six knees. All were in the middle one third, posterior one third, or 
      middle and posterior thirds in the sagittal plane. The majority of lesions 
      spanned the intercondylar and middle one third of the femoral condyle in the 
      coronal plane (73%). There was a significant difference between secondary physeal 
      [corrected] disruption in juvenile OCD condyles compared with unaffected condyles 
      (p < 0.001) and control condyles (p < 0.001). Compared with unaffected and 
      control condyles, the OCD group showed chondroepiphysial widening (p < 0.001) and 
      subchondral bone edema (p < 0.001) on MRI. Neither chondroepiphysial integrity 
      nor chondroepiphysial contour was significantly different between groups (p = 
      0.21, p = 0.31, respectively). CONCLUSION: MRI of children with OCD consistently 
      showed secondary physis disruption, overlying chondroepiphysial widening, and 
      subchondral bone edema. We suggest that disruption of normal endochondral 
      ossification may be associated with juvenile OCD.
