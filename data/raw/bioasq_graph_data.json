Indeed, trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3) levels were shown to be higher in Group 3 and 4 tumors compared to WNT and SHH medulloblastomas, also in tumors without detectable mutations in demethylases. Here, we report that polycomb genes, required for H3K27 methylation, are consistently upregulated in Group 3 and 4 tumors. These tumors show high expression of the homeobox transcription factor OTX2. Silencing of OTX2 in D425 medulloblastoma cells resulted in downregulation of polycomb genes such as EZH2, EED, SUZ12 and RBBP4 and upregulation of H3K27 demethylases KDM6A, KDM6B, JARID2 and KDM7A. This was accompanied by decreased H3K27me3 and increased H3K27me1 levels in promoter regions. Strikingly, the decrease of H3K27me3 was most prominent in promoters that bind OTX2. OTX2-bound promoters showed high levels of the H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks and intermediate levels of the H3K27me3 inactivation mark, reminiscent of a bivalent modification. After silencing of OTX2, H3K27me3 levels strongly dropped, but H3K4me3 and H3K9ac levels remained high. OTX2-bound bivalent genes showed high expression levels in D425, but the expression of most of these genes did not change after OTX2 silencing and loss of the H3K27me3 mark. Maintaining promoters in a bivalent state by sustaining H3K27 trimethylation therefore seems to be an important function of OTX2 in medulloblastoma, while other transcription factors might regulate the actual expression levels of these genes.", "mesh_terms": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Histones", "Humans", "Medulloblastoma", "Methylation", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Otx Transcription Factors", "Polycomb-Group Proteins", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "RNA, Messenger"]}, {"pmid": "19270706", "title": "Multiple recurrent genetic events converge on control of histone lysine methylation in medulloblastoma.", "abstract": "We used high-resolution SNP genotyping to identify regions of genomic gain and loss in the genomes of 212 medulloblastomas, malignant pediatric brain tumors.

Although both variants are found at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites, a distinct population of the SA2-containing cohesin complexes (hereafter referred to as cohesin-SA2) localize to enhancers lacking CTCF, are linked to tissue-specific transcription and cannot be replaced by the SA1-containing cohesin complex (cohesin-SA1) when SA2 is absent, a condition that has been observed in several tumors.

Neither the DNA binding property of SA1 nor this unique telomere cohesion mechanism is understood. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence imaging, we discover that SA1 displays two-state binding on DNA: searching by one-dimensional (1D) free diffusion versus recognition through subdiffusive sliding at telomeric regions. The AT-hook motif in SA1 plays dual roles in modulating non-specific DNA binding and subdiffusive dynamics over telomeric regions. TRF1 tethers SA1 within telomeric regions that SA1 transiently interacts with. SA1 and TRF1 together form longer DNA-DNA pairing tracts than with TRF1 alone, as revealed by atomic force microscopy imaging.

Acute depletion of Gli1 in postnatal NSCs by short-hairpin RNA decreased proliferation, whereas germline deletion of Gli1 did not affect NSC proliferation, suggesting a difference in mechanisms of Gli1 compensation that may be developmentally dependent. To determine whether Gli1 was sufficient to enhance NSC proliferation, we overexpressed this mitogen and were surprised to find that Gli1 resulted in decreased proliferation, accumulation of NSCs in the G2/M phase of cell cycle, and apoptosis. In contrast, Gli1-expressing lineage-restricted neural precursors demonstrated a 4.5-fold proliferation enhancement. Expression analyses of Gli1-expressing NSCs identified significant induction of Gadd45a and decreased cyclin A2 and Stag1 mRNA, genes involved in the G2-M transition and apoptosis.

Certain electromagnetic fields (at extremely low frequency) have been recognized as possibly carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Given the use of radiofrequency technology in cell phones, the rapid increase in the number of cell phones has generated concerns about the existence of a potential health hazard. To evaluate the relationship between the use of cell phones and the development of tumors of the head, a multicentric international study (INTERPHONE), coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, was carried out in 13 countries. This publication reports the results of the French part of the INTERPHONE study. METHODS: INTERPHONE is a case-control study focused on tumors of the brain and central nervous system: gliomas, meningiomas and neuromas of cranial nerves. Eligible cases were men and women, residents of Paris or Lyon, aged 30-59, newly diagnosed with a first primary tumor between February 2001 and August 2003. The diagnoses were all either histologically confirmed or based upon unequivocal radiological images. Controls were matched for gender, age (+/-5 years) and place of residence. They were randomly drawn from electoral rolls. Detailed information was collected for all subjects during a computer-assisted face-to-face interview. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for an association between the use of cell phones and risk of each type of cancer. RESULTS: Regular cell phone use was not associated with an increased risk of neuroma (OR=0,92; 95% confidence interval=[0.53-1.59]), meningioma (OR=0,74; 95% confidence interval=[0.43-1.28]) or glioma (OR=1.15; 95% confidence interval=[0.65-2.05]). Although these results are not statistically significant, a general tendency was observed for an increased risk of glioma among the heaviest users: long-term users, heavy users, users with the largest numbers of telephones. CONCLUSION: No significant increased risk for glioma, meningioma or neuroma was observed among cell phone users participating in Interphone. The statistical power of the study is limited, however.

Information about benign and malignant primary intracerebral tumor cases 20-79 years of age was obtained from the national cancer registries in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden for the years 1969-98 and estimates of person-years at risk were calculated from the information obtained from national population registries.

WHO recommended studies around base stations in 2003 but again stated in 2006 that studies on cancer in relation to base station exposure are of low priority. As a result only few investigations of effects of base station exposure on health and wellbeing exist. Cross-sectional investigations of subjective health as a function of distance or measured field strength, despite differences in methods and robustness of study design, found indications for an effect of exposure that is likely independent of concerns and attributions. Experimental studies applying short-term exposure to base station signals gave various results, but there is weak evidence that UMTS and to a lesser degree GSM signals reduce wellbeing in persons that report to be sensitive to such exposures. Two ecological studies of cancer in the vicinity of base stations report both a strong increase of incidence within a radius of 350 and 400m respectively. Due to the limitations inherent in this design no firm conclusions can be drawn, but the results underline the urgent need for a comprehensive investigation of this issue. Animal and in vitro studies are inconclusive to date. An increased incidence of DMBA induced mammary tumors in rats at a SAR of 1.4W/kg in one experiment could not be replicated in a second trial. Indications of oxidative stress after low-level in vivo exposure of rats could not be supported by in vitro studies of human fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells. From available evidence it is impossible to delineate a threshold below which no effect occurs, however, given the fact that studies reporting low exposure were invariably negative it is suggested that power densities around 0.5-1mW/m(2) must be exceeded in order to observe an effect. The meager data base must be extended in the coming years.

CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION The target population of this review is women with newly diagnosed early stage (stage I-IIIa) invasive breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor (ER) positive and/or progesterone-receptor (PR) positive. Much of this review, however, is relevant for women with early stage (I and II) invasive breast cancer that is specifically ER positive, lymph node (LN) negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) negative. This refined population represents an estimated incident population of 3,315 new breast cancers in Ontario (according to 2007 data). Currently it is estimated that only 15% of these women will develop a distant metastasis at 10 years; however, a far great proportion currently receive adjuvant chemotherapy, suggesting that more women are being treated with chemotherapy than can benefit. There is therefore a need to develop better prognostic and predictive tools to improve the selection of women that may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. TECHNOLOGY OF CONCERN: The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. The panel of 21 genes include genes associated with tumour proliferation and invasion, as well as other genes related to HER-2/neu expression, ER expression, and progesterone receptor (PR) expression. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: What is the laboratory performance of Oncotype-DX?How reliable is Oncotype-DX (i.e., how repeatable and reproducible is Oncotype-DX)?How often does Oncotype-DX fail to give a useable result?What is the prognostic value of Oncotype-DX?Is Oncotype-DX recurrence score associated with the risk of distant recurrence or death due to any cause in women with early breast cancer receiving tamoxifen?What is the predictive value of Oncotype-DX?Does Oncoytpe-DX recurrence score predict significant benefit in terms of improvements in 10-year distant recurrence or death due to any cause for women receiving tamoxifen plus chemotherapy in comparison to women receiving tamoxifen alone?How does Oncotype-DX compare to other known predictors of risk such as Adjuvant! Online?How does Oncotype-DX impact patient quality of life and clinical/patient decision-making? SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature search was performed on March 19(th), 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1(st), 2006 to March 19(th), 2010. A starting search date of January 1(st), 2006 was because a comprehensive systematic review of Oncotype-DX was identified in preliminary literature searching. This systematic review, by Marchionni et al. (2008), included literature up to January 1(st), 2007. All studies identified in the review by Marchionni et al. as well as those identified in updated literature searching were used to form the evidentiary base of this review. The quality of the overall body of evidence was identified as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Any observational trial, controlled clinical trial, randomized controlled trial (RCT), meta-analysis or systematic review that reported on the laboratory performance, prognostic value and/or predictive value of Oncotype-DX testing, or other outcome relevant to the Key Questions, specific to the target population was included. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies that did not report original data or original data analysis,Studies published in a language other than English,Studies reported only in abstract or as poster presentations (such publications were not sought nor included in this review since the MAS does not generally consider evidence that is not subject to peer review nor does the MAS consider evidence that lacks detailed description of methodology). OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Outcomes of interest varied depending on the Key Question. For the Key Questions of prognostic and predictive value (Key Questions #2 and #3), the prospectively defined primary outcome was risk of 10-year distant recurrence. The prospectively defined secondary outcome was 10-year death due to any cause (i.e., overall survival). All additional outcomes such as risk of locoregional recurrence or disease-free survival (DFS) were not prospectively determined for this review but were reported as presented in included trials; these outcomes are referenced as tertiary outcomes in this review. Outcomes for other Key Questions (i.e., Key Questions #1, #4 and #5) were not prospectively defined due to the variability in endpoints relevant for these questions. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: A total of 26 studies were included. Of these 26 studies, only five studies were relevant to the primary questions of this review (Key Questions #2 and #3). The following conclusions were drawn from the entire body of evidence: There is a lack of external validation to support the reliability of Oncotype-DX; however, the current available evidence derived from internal industry validation studies suggests that Oncotype-DX is reliable (i.e., Oncotype-DX is repeatable and reproducible).Current available evidence suggests a moderate failure rate of Oncotype-DX testing; however, the failure rate observed across clinical trials included in this review is likely inflated; the current Ontario experience suggests an acceptably lower rate of test failure.In women with newly diagnosed early breast cancer (stage I-II) that is estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive and lymph-node negative:There is low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has prognostic value in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole (the latter for postmenopausal women only),There is very low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX can predict which women will benefit from adjuvant CMF/MF chemotherapy in women being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.In postmenopausal women with newly diagnosed early breast cancer that is estrogen-receptor positive and/or progesterone-receptor positive and lymph-node positive:There is low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has limited prognostic value in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen or anastrozole,There is very low quality evidence that Oncotype-DX has limited predictive value for predicting which women will benefit from adjuvant CAF chemotherapy in women who are being treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.There are methodological and statistical limitations that affect both the generalizability of the current available evidence, as well as the magnitude and statistical strength of the observed effect sizes; in particular:Of the major predictive trials, Oncotype-DX scores were only produced for a small subset of women (<40% of the original randomized population) potentially disabling the effects of treatment randomization and opening the possibility of selection bias;Data is not specific to HER-2/neu-negative women;There were limitations with multivariate statistical analyses.Additional trials of observational design may provide further validation of the prognostic and predictive value of Oncotype-DX; however, it is unlikely that prospective or randomized data will become available in the near future due to ethical, time and resource considerations.There is currently insufficient evidence investigating how Oncoytpe-DX compares to other known prognostic estimators of risk, such as Adjuvant! Online, and there is insufficient evidence investigating how Oncotype-DX would impact clinician/patient decision-making in a setting generalizable to Ontario.", "mesh_terms": []}, {"pmid": "17039265", "title": "Predicting response to primary chemotherapy: gene expression profiling of paraffin-embedded core biopsy tissue.", "abstract": "PURPOSE: Primary chemotherapy provides an ideal opportunity to correlate gene expression with response to treatment. We used paraffin-embedded core biopsies from a completed phase II trial to identify genes that correlate with response to primary chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with newly diagnosed stage II or III breast cancer were treated with sequential doxorubicin 75 mg/M2 q2 wks x 3 and docetaxel 40 mg/M2 weekly x 6; treatment order was randomly assigned. Pretreatment core biopsy samples were interrogated for genes that might correlate with pathologic complete response (pCR). In addition to the individual genes, the correlation of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score with pCR was examined. RESULTS: Of 70 patients enrolled in the parent trial, core biopsies samples with sufficient RNA for gene analyses were available from 45 patients; 9 (20%) had inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). Six (14%) patients achieved a pCR. Twenty-two of the 274 candidate genes assessed correlated with pCR (p < 0.05). Genes correlating with pCR could be grouped into three large clusters: angiogenesis-related genes, proliferation related genes, and invasion-related genes. Expression of estrogen receptor (ER)-related genes and Recurrence Score did not correlate with pCR. In an exploratory analysis we compared gene expression in IBC to non-inflammatory breast cancer; twenty-four (9%) of the genes were differentially expressed (p < 0.05), 5 were upregulated and 19 were downregulated in IBC.

Levels of other components of the autophagy pathway such as Atg5, Atg10, Atg12 and Beclin-1 were not different in DLB compared to controls. In DLB brains, mTor was more abundant in neurons displaying alpha-synuclein accumulation. These neurons also showed abnormal expression of lysosomal markers such as LC3, and ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of abundant and abnormal autophagosomes.

However, the molecular mechanisms and the potential sequence of events involved in the formation of pore-like structures are unclear. We utilized computer modeling and cell-based studies to investigate the process of oligomerization of wild-type and A53T mutant alpha-syn in membranes. The studies suggest that alpha-syn penetrates the membrane rapidly, changing its conformation from alpha-helical towards a coiled structure. This penetration facilitates the incorporation of additional alpha-syn monomers in the complex, and the subsequent displacement of phospholipids and the formation of oligomers in the membrane. This process occurred more rapidly, and with a more favorable energy of interaction, for mutant A53T compared with wild-type alpha-syn. After 4 ns of simulation of the protein-membrane model, alpha-syn had penetrated through two-thirds of the membrane. By 9 ns, the penetration of the annular alpha-syn oligomers can result in the formation of pore-like structures that fully perforate the lipid bilayer. Experimental incubation of recombinant alpha-syn in synthetic membranes resulted in the formation of similar pore-like complexes. Moreover, mutant (A53T) alpha-syn had a greater tendency to accumulate in neuronal membrane fractions in cell cultures, resulting in greater neuronal permeability, as demonstrated with the calcein efflux assay.

Here, we investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of the iron chelator deferoxamine in vivo to elucidate whether iron chelation can provide meaningful therapy for Parkinson's disease.

The Lausanne NoSAS (Neck circumference, Obesity, Snoring, Age, Sex) score test is a simple, efficient, and easily employed tool enabling identification of individuals at risk for the disease. The score ranges from 0 to 17 and the patient has a high probability of OSA if they have a NoSAS score of 8 or higher. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of the NoSAS score as a screening tool for the diagnosis of OSA in a sleep clinic. METHODS: Prospectively, for 12 months, we included all the patients referred by primary care physicians to our sleep unit for clinical evaluation who had undergone in-lab polysomnography (PSG) and completed the NoSAS score. This test assigns 4 points for a neck circumference of more than 40cm, 3 points for a body-mass index of 25kg/m(2) to less than 30kg/m(2) or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age and 2 points for being male. RESULTS: Of the 294 patients, 70.7% were male, aged 53.5+/-12.1 years, with a neck circumference of 41.0+/-3.6cm and a BMI of 30.8+/-5.1kg/m(2). OSA was present in 84.0% of the patients, 34.8% with moderate OSA and 36.4% severe OSA. Using the NoSAS model for the prediction of all OSA, moderate/severe OSA and severe OSA, the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) was 0.770 (IC95%: (0.703; 0.837), p<0.001), 0.746 (IC95%: (0.691; 0.802), p<0.001) and 0.686 (IC95%: (0.622; 0.749), p<0.001), respectively, thus confirming the diagnostic ability of the NoSAS model. With a NoSAS score >/=7, the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 94.3% and 87.6% for all OSA, 94.9% and 62.8% for moderate/severe OSA and 100% and 33.8% for severe OSA, respectively. With the same cut-off, the negative predictive value (NPV) for moderate/severe and severe OSA were 67.9% and 100%, respectively. Each increase in the NoSAS score was associated with an increase in the probability of OSA, reaching a 97% OSA probability for a score of 17. CONCLUSIONS: The NoSAS score showed high sensitivity and PPV for OSA with specificity and diagnostic accuracy steadily increasing with higher scores. Furthermore, a low score showed high predictive value for the exclusion of moderate/severe OSA. Overall, our results suggest that, in primary care, this score can be a powerful tool for stratifying and prioritizing patients in the diagnosis of OSA. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this score in hospital health care, in younger populations, with a predominance of female and non-obese individuals or in cardiovascular disease.", "mesh_terms": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Body Mass Index", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neck", "Obesity", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Sex Factors", "Sleep Apnea, Obstructive", "Snoring", "Young Adult"]}, {"pmid": "29518851", "title": "[Comparison of the NoSAS score with four different questionnaires as screening tools for obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome].", "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the clinical utility of the NoSAS score in the screening of patients with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome(OSAHS), and to compare the performance of the NoSAS score with other tools including Epworth Sleepiness Scale(ESS), STOP, STOP-Bang(SBQ) and Berlin questionnaires. Methods: A total of 444 consecutive patients(328 males and 116 females) with suspected OSAHS who underwent an overnight polysomnography(PSG) were recruited into this study. Five questionnaires including the NoSAS score, ESS, STOP, SBQ and Berlin were completed. Based on the severity of OSAHS which was determined by apnea-hypopnea index(AHI), the patients were classified into 4 groups: normal(<5 events/h), mild(5-15 events/h), moderate(15-30 events/h) and, severe (>/=30 events/h) OSA.Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 5 questionnaires were calculated.

The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the NoSAS score in predicting the presence of OSAS among participants with current MDE and to compare it with the performance of existing screening tools. METHODS: A random sample of the population-based cohort CoLaus (Lausanne, Switzerland) underwent a psychiatric evaluation (PsyCoLaus) and a complete polysomnography at home (HypnoLaus). The effectiveness of the NoSAS score in detecting the risk of significant OSAS among current MDE participants was assessed and compared with STOP-BANG and Berlin scores. RESULTS: Among the 1761 subjects (58,75 +/- 11y.o.; 47,8%men) who underwent polysomnography, significant OSAS was present in 24.0% with and 26.1% without current MDE.

Considering the cost and low availability of these procedures, preselection of patients at high risk is recommended. We aimed to develop a screening tool allowing identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. METHODS: We used the participants from the population-based HypnoLaus cohort in Lausanne, Switzerland, who had a clinical assessment and polysomnography at home, to build a clinical score (the NoSAS score) using multiple factor analysis and logistic regression to identify people likely to have clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing. The NoSAS score was externally validated in an independent sleep cohort (EPISONO). We compared its performance to existing screening scores (STOP-Bang and Berlin scores). FINDINGS: We used the 2121 participants from the HypnoLaus cohort who were assessed between Sept 1, 2009, and June 30, 2013. The NoSAS score, which ranges from 0 to 17, allocates 4 points for having a neck circumference of more than 40 cm, 3 points for having a body-mass index of 25 kg/m(2) to less than 30 kg/m(2) or 5 points for having a body-mass index of 30 kg/m(2) or more, 2 points for snoring, 4 points for being older than 55 years of age, and 2 points for being male. Using a threshold of 8 points or more, the NoSAS score identified individuals at risk of clinically significant sleep-disordered breathing, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.76). It showed an even higher performance in the EPISONO cohort, with an AUC of 0.81 (0.77-0.85). The NoSAS score performed significantly better than did the STOP-Bang (AUC 0.67 [95% CI 0.65-0.69]; p<0.0001) and Berlin (0.63 [0.61-0.66]; p<0.0001) scores. INTERPRETATION: The NoSAS score is a simple, efficient, and easy to implement score enabling identification of individuals at risk of sleep-disordered breathing. Because of its high discrimination power, the NoSAS score can help clinicians to decide which patients to further investigate with a nocturnal recording.

The hitchhiking effect of a rapidly spreading beneficial mutation, which results in local removal of standing genetic variation, allows such an analysis using DNA sequence polymorphism. However, the current mathematical theory that predicts the pattern of genetic hitchhiking relies on the assumption that a beneficial mutation increases to a high frequency in a single random-mating population, which is certainly violated in reality. Individuals in natural populations are distributed over a geographic space. The spread of a beneficial allele can be delayed by limited migration of individuals over the space and its hitchhiking effect can also be affected. To study this effect of geographic structure on genetic hitchhiking, we analyze a simple model of directional selection in a subdivided population. In contrast to previous studies on hitchhiking in subdivided populations, we mainly investigate the range of sufficiently high migration rates that would homogenize genetic variation at neutral loci. We provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that describes how the genealogical structure at a neutral locus linked to the locus under selection is expected to change in a population divided into two demes. Our results indicate that the overall strength of genetic hitchhiking--the degree to which expected heterozygosity decreases--is diminished by population subdivision, mainly because opportunity for the breakdown of hitchhiking by recombination increases as the spread of the beneficial mutation across demes is delayed when migration rate is much smaller than the strength of selection. Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations.

OsAMT1;1 is a high-affinity ammonium transporter in rice (Oryza sativa L.), responsible for ammonium uptake at low nitrogen concentration. The expression pattern of the gene has been reported. However, variations in its nucleotides and the evolutionary pathway of its descent from wild progenitors are yet to be elucidated. In this study, nucleotide diversity of the gene OsAMT1;1 and the diversity pattern of seven gene fragments spanning a genomic region approximately 150 kb long surrounding the gene were surveyed by sequencing a panel of 216 rice accessions including both cultivated rice and wild relatives. RESULTS: Nucleotide polymorphism (Pi) of OsAMT1;1 was as low as 0.00004 in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), only 2.3% of that in the common wild rice (O. rufipogon). A single dominant haplotype was fixed at the locus in O. sativa. The test values for neutrality were significantly negative in the entire region stretching 5' upstream and 3' downstream of the gene in all accessions. The value of linkage disequilibrium remained high across a 100 kb genomic region around OsAMT1;1 in O. sativa, but fell rapidly in O. rufipogon on either side of the promoter of OsAMT1;1, demonstrating a strong natural selection within or nearby the ammonium transporter. CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice.

We model the process of breed formation and show that the probability of two or three adjacent marker loci showing a spurious signal of selection within at least one breed (i.e., Type I error or false-positive rate) is low if highly variable and moderately spaced markers are utilized.

On the basis of this result, we develop an estimator for the selection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel variation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on preexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.

While the oldest sub-Saharan lineages, ~500 thousand years, are found among Khoe-San from southern-Africa, a distinct haplotype found among Biaka is likely due to admixture from an even older population. An East African population that gave rise to non-Africans underwent a selective sweep affecting the subcentromeric region where MTMR8 is located. This and similar sweeps in four other regions of the X chromosome, documented in the literature, effectively reduced genetic diversity of non-African chromosomes and therefore may have exacerbated the effect of the demographic bottleneck usually ascribed to the out of Africa migration.

By analyzing within-patient longitudinal sequence data, we make four observations that shed a light on the underlying processes and allow us to infer the short-term effective population size of the viral population in a patient. Our first observation is that the evolution of drug resistance usually occurs by the fixation of one drug-resistance mutation at a time, as opposed to several changes simultaneously. Second, we find that these fixation events are accompanied by a reduction in genetic diversity in the region surrounding the fixed drug-resistance mutation, due to the hitchhiking effect. Third, we observe that the fixation of drug-resistance mutations involves both hard and soft selective sweeps. In a hard sweep, a resistance mutation arises in a single viral particle and drives all linked mutations with it when it spreads in the viral population, which dramatically reduces genetic diversity. On the other hand, in a soft sweep, a resistance mutation occurs multiple times on different genetic backgrounds, and the reduction of diversity is weak. Using the frequency of occurrence of hard and soft sweeps we estimate the effective population size of HIV to be 1.5 x 10(5) (95% confidence interval [0.8 x 10(5),4.8 x 10(5)]). This number is much lower than the actual number of infected cells, but much larger than previous population size estimates based on synonymous diversity.

Here, we demonstrated that RAW macrophages effectively suppressed C. trachomatis growth and prevented Golgi stack disruption, a hallmark defect in epithelial cells after C. trachomatis infection. Next, we systematically examined association between C. trachomatis and various endocytic pathway markers. Spinning disk confocal time-lapse studies revealed significant and rapid association between C. trachomatis with Rab7 and LAMP1, markers of late endosomes and lysosomes. Moreover, pretreatment with an inhibitor of lysosome acidification led to significant increases in C. trachomatis growth in macrophages. At later stages of infection, C. trachomatis associated with the autophagy marker LC3. TEM analysis confirmed that a significant portion of C. trachomatis resided within double-membrane-bound compartments, characteristic of autophagosomes. Together, these results suggest that macrophages can suppress C. trachomatis growth by targeting it rapidly to lysosomes; moreover, autophagy is activated at later stages of infection and targets significant numbers of the invading bacteria, which may enhance subsequent chlamydial antigen presentation.", "mesh_terms": ["Animals", "Autophagy", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Epithelial Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Lysosomes", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Vacuoles", "rab GTP-Binding Proteins", "rab5 GTP-Binding Proteins", "rab7 GTP-Binding Proteins"]}, {"pmid": "24255881", "title": "mTOR signaling in liver regeneration: Rapamycin combined with growth factor treatment.", "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the effects of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition on liver regeneration and autophagy in a surgical resection model.

In the immunosuppressant group, part of the group was treated subcutaneously 4 h prior to and 24 h after PH with a combination of human recombinant interleukin 6 (IL-6; 500 mug/kg per day) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; 100 mug/kg per day) in PBS. Animals were sacrificed 2, 3 or 5 d after PH and liver tissue and blood were collected for further analysis. Immunohistochemical staining for 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to quantify hepatocyte proliferation. Western blotting was used to detect hepatic microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II protein expression as a marker for autophagy. Hepatic gene expression levels of proliferation-, inflammation- and angiogenesis-related genes were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and serum bilirubin and transaminase levels were analyzed at the clinical chemical core facility of the Erasmus MC-University Medical Center. RESULTS: mTOR inhibition significantly suppressed regeneration, shown by decreased hepatocyte proliferation (2% vs 12% BrdU positive hepatocyte nuclei at day 2, P < 0.01; 0.8% vs 1.4% at day 5, P = 0.02) and liver weight reconstitution (63% vs 76% of initial total liver weight at day 3, P = 0.04), and furthermore increased serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase 641 U/L vs 185 U/L at day 2, P = 0.02). Expression of the autophagy marker LC3-II, which was reduced during normal liver regeneration, increased after mTOR inhibition (46% increase at day 2, P = 0.04). Hepatic gene expression showed an increased inflammation-related response [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha 3.2-fold upregulation at day 2, P = 0.03; IL-1Ra 6.0-fold upregulation at day 2 and 42.3-fold upregulation at day 5, P < 0.01] and a reduced expression of cell cycle progression and angiogenesis-related factors (HGF 40% reduction at day 2; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 50% reduction at days 2 and 5; angiopoietin 1 60% reduction at day 2, all P </= 0.01). Treatment with the regeneration stimulating cytokine IL-6 and growth factor HGF could overcome the inhibitory effect on liver weight (75% of initial total liver weight at day 3, P = 0.02 vs immunosuppression alone and P = 0.90 vs controls) and partially reversed gene expression changes caused by rapamycin (TNF-alpha and IL-1Ra levels at day 2 were restored to control levels).

We tested our hypothesis using ex vivo and in vivo studies of human and mouse adipose tissue. Levels of the autophagy marker LC3 were elevated in sc adipose tissue of obese vs. lean human subjects and positively correlated to both systemic insulin resistance and morphological characteristics of adipose tissue inflammation. Similarly, autophagic activity levels were increased in adipose tissue of obese and insulin resistant animals as compared with lean mice.

MAP1S interacts with LC3 (light chain 3), the mammalian homologue of yeast autophagy marker ATG8 and one of the most important autophagy markers in mammalian cells, and helps the attachment of autophagosomes with microtubules for trafficking and recruitment of substrate mitochondria into autophagosomes for degradation. MAP1S activates autophagosomal biogenesis and degradation to remove misfolded/aggregated proteins and dysfunctional organelles such as mitochondria and suppress oxidative stress-induced genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Previously, various studies have attributed LRPPRC nucleic acid-associated functions. Instead, in the present study, we show that LRPPRC associates with mitochondria, interacts with Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 and forms a ternary complex to maintain the stability of Bcl-2. Suppression of LRPPRC leads to reduction in mitochondrial potential and reduction in Bcl-2. Lower levels of Bcl-2 lead to release of more Beclin 1 to form the Beclin 1-PI3KCIII (class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase) complex to activate autophagy and accelerate the turnover of dysfunctional mitochondria through the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. The activation of autophagy induced by LRPPRC suppression occurs upstream of the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate-mediated conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II and has been confirmed in multiple mammalian cell lines with multiple autophagy markers including the size of GFP-LC3 punctate foci, the intensity of LC3-II and p62 protein and the size of the vacuolar structure.

All patients underwent NCT followed by mastectomy and were considered nonpathologic complete responders (non-pCR) after a pathologic evaluation. The prognostic value of various clinicopathologic factors was evaluated. RESULTS: The LC3B density was similar between the peripheral and central area of the tumors (P = 0.328) but was significantly lower in the extratumoral area (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, LC3B density, which correlated with Beclin-1 expression, Ki-67 index, and breast cancer subtype, served as an independent prognostic factor for both relapse-free survival (RFS; P = 0.012) and overall survival (OS; P = 0.008); the prognostic value of LC3B was most significant in triple-negative patients.

Lentivirus-transfected stable U251 and U373 cells were used to assess the biological functions of the novel protein invitro and invivo (five mice per group). Clinical implications of circ-FBXW7 were assessed in 38 pathologically diagnosed glioblastoma samples and their paired periphery normal brain tissues by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (two-sided log-rank test).

A 5 ml venous blood sample was obtained from each participant and epidemiological information was collected on a standard questionnaire. Illumina Infinium((R)) BeadChip was used for genotyping of 35 DNA damage-related single nucleotide variations (SNVs), which were identified in our previous study. Multivariate and binary logistic regressions were used to calculate the OR and 95%CI for lung cancer risk. HaploReg V4.1 and Regulome DB were used to understand functional annotation on important SNV. RESULTS: The distributions of age (61.06+/-10.15) vs. (61.32+/-11.07) years; t=-0.72, P=0.473) and sex (chi(2)=1.81, P=0.179) were similar between cases and controls.

After step-wise logistic regression analysis, only the rs3130683 SNV was retained in the model, indicating that the association between rs9267576 and lung cancer may be due to the effect of rs3130683. Functional annotation indicated that rs3130683 was located in the promoter and enhancer regions, and was an expression quantitative trait loci of HLA.

The data were recorded and analyzed: type and severity of hemophilia, presence of inhibitor, etiological antecedent, localization of pseudotumors, clinical signs, surgical management and outcomes. RESULTS: Eighteen pseudotumor patients underwent surgical treatment. All of them were male, with mean age of 34.3 years. Fifteen patients had hemophilia A and three patients had hemophilia B.

METHODS: The cases of 23 patients with HPT who had surgical treatment from July 1996 to December 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, blood loss and transfusion during surgery, outcomes, and complications after surgery were analyzed. RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent HPT resection; 4 underwent HPT excision, allograft transplantation, and absorbable screw fixation; 3 had HPT resection and metallic internal fixation; 2 had HPT resection, autogenous fibular grafting, and absorbable screw fixation; 2 underwent curettage and bone-grafting; and 1 patient received above-the-knee amputation. The average age (and standard deviation) of the patients at the time of surgery was 31.9 +/- 12.8 years (range, 6 to 54 years) with an average follow-up of 5.3 +/- 4.7 years (range, 1.1 to 19.6 years).

RESULTS: Imaging workup revealed a large, heterogeneous, dense lesion in the patient's left-side maxillary sinus with distortion of the orbital floor and hard palate. Because of the concern for an aggressive malignancy, a biopsy was performed. After a Caldwell-Luc approach, a large amount of greenish fluid leaked from an otherwise empty maxillary sinus.

The incidence continues to decrease, likely because of increasingly sophisticated techniques in managing factor deficiency. We present a case of hemophilic pseudotumor in a patient without hemophilia, an exceptionally rare entity, and outline a hybrid approach to treatment. PRESENTATION OF CASE: The patient presented with a left sided iliopsoas mass and associated radiculopathy, with a history of a poorly characterized bleeding diathesis and Noonan's syndrome. He had no history of trauma and was not being treated with anti-coagulation. Of note, factors VIII, IX and XI were normal. An open biopsy was consistent with hemophilic pseudotumor. The patient underwent a hybrid procedure of preoperative embolization of the left internal iliac and left deep circumflex arteries followed by surgical debridement and resection, with an excellent outcome. DISCUSSION: Hemophilic pseudotumor is rarely seen in patients with hemophilia, and even less frequently in patients without. Trauma is often the inciting event. A high index of clinical suspicion is required in order to secure the diagnosis, as the radiographic appearance is non-specific. Our patient had no history of trauma, although we question whether his underlying bleeding diathesis may have predisposed him to developing the pseudotumor. Surgery remains the cornerstone of management in these cases.

An inadequate treatment of that bleeding in hemophilia may result in pseudotumor, usually in the muscle adjacent to the bone. We reported haemophilic pseudotumor treated with various surgical interventions. METHODS: This study was conducted inthe Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatology at a government hospital over a period of 7 years(2010 -2017). Patients Perioperative management was done in accordance with the Integrated Hemophilia Team of our institution protocol.Diagnosis and management planning of hemophilic pseudotumor was confirmed via Integrated HemophiliaTeam meeting. After the surgery, all patients were asked to come for routine follow up. RESULTS: We reported six Haemophilia-A patients with pseudotumor in the pelvis, proximal femur and lower leg. One case in pelvic bone underwent hematoma evacuation, acetabular reconstruction using the Harrington procedure, and total hip arthroplasty.Two cases, a case in the proximal femur and another case in the distal fibula, were treated with amputation, other two cases, one was soft tissue psedotumor in the pelvic region and was treated by hematoma evacuation, and the remaining casewas managed with wide excision and followed by defect closure. CONCLUSION: Surgery is a preferable treatment for pseudotumors that have been present for years.It's associated with the best outcomes especially when selected as the primary line ofwith preventable and manageable bleeding complication.

METHODS: Clinical medical records were retrieved from the Hemophilia Center, Nanfang Hospital, to identify the patients who had been surgically treated from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2017 with a definite diagnosis of HPT. Their clinical features, surgical management, outcomes and complications after surgery were analysed. RESULTS: We identified 34 patients with HPT who had surgical treatment over a 12-year period and five of them had multiple HPTs. The incidence of HPT at this centre was 2.3% over the dozen years. A previous trauma leading to the development of HPT was reported in 18 cases (52.9%). The HPT affected only soft tissue in 7 patients, bone and soft tissue in 25 ones and joint in 2 ones.

SETTING: Private clinical practice, Athens, Greece. DESIGN: Comparative case series. METHODS: Fourier-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) was used to obtain in vivo 3-dimensional epithelial thickness maps and center, superior, inferior, maximum, minimum, mean, midperipheral, and variability data. RESULTS: Group A comprised 175 treated keratoconic eyes (Athens protocol); Group B, 193 untreated keratoconic eyes; and Group C, 160 healthy eyes. The 1-year mean center epithelial thickness in Group A was 47.78 mum +/- 7.36 (SD) (range 33 to 64 mum). At the first clinical visit, it was 52.09 +/- 6.80 mum (range 36 to 72 mum) in Group B and 52.54 +/- 3.23 mum (range 45 to 59 mum) in Group C. The mean thickness range in Group A at 1 year was -19.94 +/- 7.21 mum (range -6 to -34 mum). It was -21.83 +/- 12.07 mum (range -4 to -66 mum) in Group B and -6.86 +/- 3.33 mum (range -3 to -29 mum) in Group C. The mean topographic thickness variability in Group A at 1 year was 4.64 +/- 1.63 mum (range 1.6 to 8.1 mum) (P<.05). It was 5.77 +/- 3.39 mum (range 1.3 to 17.8 mum) in Group B and 1.59 +/- 0.79 mum (range 0.6 to 5.6 mum) in Group C.

Of the two mTOR complexes, mTORC1 is by far the best characterized. When active, mTORC1 triggers cell growth and proliferation by promoting protein synthesis, lipid biogenesis, and metabolism, and by reducing autophagy. The fact that mTORC1 deregulation is associated with several human diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurodegeneration, highlights its importance in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.

We investigated whether activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) prevents the hepatic insulin resistance that is induced by the consumption of a high-protein diet (HPD) and the presence of excess amino acids. Exposure of HepG2 cells to excess amino acids reduced AMPK phosphorylation, upregulated Notch1 expression, and impaired the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser(473) and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Tyr(612). Inhibition of Notch1 prevented amino acid-induced insulin resistance, which was accompanied by reduced expression of Rbp-Jk, hairy and enhancer of split-1, and forkhead box O1. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1 expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Activation of AMPK by metformin inhibited mTORC1-STAT3 signaling, thereby preventing excess amino acid-impaired insulin signaling. Finally, HPD feeding suppressed AMPK activity, activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling, and induced insulin resistance. Chronic administration of either metformin or rapamycin inhibited the HPD-activated mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 signaling pathway and prevented hepatic insulin resistance.

By blocking mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling, rapalogue efficacy is likely to occur, in part, through suppression of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). We show that rapamycin reduces HIF-1alpha protein levels, and to a lesser extent VEGF-A levels, in renal cystadenoma cells in a Tsc2+/- mouse model. We established that mTORC1 drives HIF-1alpha protein accumulation through enhanced transcription of HIF-1alpha mRNA, a process that is blocked by either inhibition or knockdown of signal transducer and activation of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1alpha mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1alpha synthesis on a translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1alpha degradation remains unaffected. We therefore proposed that mTORC1 drives HIF-1alpha synthesis in a multifaceted manner through 4E-BP1/eIF4E, S6K1 and STAT3.

Although both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 regulate HIF-1alpha translation, VEGF-A is primarily under the control of 4E-BP1/eIF4E.

The combination of Evans index and corpus callosum angle on MRI is very useful to improve the differential diagnosis with cerebral atrophy. Spinal tap test (lumbar puncture with the removal of 40 mL of CSF) can be repeated two or three times for consecutive days to improve the predictive value before shunting.

This type of hydrocephalus is caused by impaired cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption without any obstruction in the ventricular system and is associated with normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It is characterised clinically by gait disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, and urinary incontinence (known as the Hakim-Adams triad). The exact cause of iNPH is unknown. It may be managed conservatively or treated surgically by inserting a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt. However, a substantial number of patients do not respond well to surgical treatment, complication rates are high and there is often a need for further surgery. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an alternative surgical intervention. It has been suggested that ETV may lead to better outcomes, including fewer complications. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of ETV for treatment of patients with iNPH compared to conservative therapy, or shunting of CSF using VP or VA shunts.To assess the perioperative and postoperative complication rates in patients with iNPH after ETV compared to conservative therapy, VP or VA shunting. SEARCH METHODS: We searched for eligible studies using ALOIS: a comprehensive register of dementia studies, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and several bibliographic databases such as MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (BIREME).We also searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) to identify potentially relevant reviews. The search strategy was adapted for other databases, using the most appropriate controlled vocabulary for each. We did not apply any language or time restrictions. The searches were performed in August 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of ETV treatment of iNPH. Patients had to have at least two symptoms of the Hakim-Adams triad. Exclusion criteria were obstructive causes of hydrocephalus, other significant intracranial pathology and other confirmed causes of dementia. The eligible comparators were conservative treatment or shunting using VP and VA shunts. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened search results, selected eligible studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for additional data. MAIN RESULTS: Only one study met the inclusion criteria: an RCT comparing effectiveness of ETV and non-programmable VP shunts in 42 patients with iNPH. The study was conducted in Brazil between 2009 and 2012. The overall study risk of bias was high. The primary outcome in the study was the proportion of patients with improved symptoms one year after surgery, determined as a change of at least two points on the Japanese NPH scale. Due to imprecision in the results, it was not possible to determine whether there was any difference between groups in the proportion of patients who improved 3 or 12 months after surgery (3 months: odds ration (OR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 4.76, n = 42; 12 months: OR 2.5, 95% CI 0.62 to 10.11, n = 38). We were unable to estimate the effect of treatment on other efficacy outcomes (cognition, balance, function, gait and mobility) because they were inadequately reported. Of the 26 patients in the VP shunting group, 5 developed subdural hematoma postoperatively, while there were no complications among the 16 patients in the ETV group (OR 0.12, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.3, n = 42), but the estimate was too imprecise to determine whether this was likely to reflect a true difference in complication rates. This was also the case for rates of further surgical intervention (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.31 to 6.24, n = 42). There were no deaths during the trial. We judged the quality of evidence for all outcomes to be very low because of a high risk of selection, attrition and reporting bias and serious imprecision in the results. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The only randomised trial of ETV for iNPH compares it to an intervention which is not a standard practice (VP shunting using a non-programmable valve). The evidence from this study is inconclusive and of very low quality. Clinicians should be aware of the limitations of the evidence.

We analysed clinical and genetic data from patients in the INC to determine the distribution of CMT subtypes and the clinical impairment associated with them. METHODS: We analysed data from 1652 patients evaluated at 13 INC centres. The distribution of CMT subtypes and pathogenic genetic mutations were determined. The disease burden of all the mutations was assessed by the CMT Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) and CMT Examination Score (CMTES). RESULTS: 997 of the 1652 patients (60.4%) received a genetic diagnosis. The most common CMT subtypes were CMT1A/PMP22 duplication, CMT1X/GJB1 mutation, CMT2A/MFN2 mutation, CMT1B/MPZ mutation, and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy/PMP22 deletion. These five subtypes of CMT accounted for 89.2% of all genetically confirmed mutations. Mean CMTNS for some but not all subtypes were similar to those previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that large numbers of patients with a representative variety of CMT subtypes have been enrolled and that the frequency of achieving a molecular diagnosis and distribution of the CMT subtypes reflects those previously reported. Measures of severity are similar, though not identical, to results from smaller series. This study confirms that it is possible to assess patients in a uniform way between international centres, which is critical for the planned natural history study and future clinical trials.

Moreover, most, if not all, patients treated with imatinib for advanced GIST will develop a secondary progressive disease under the treatment. In most cases, such progressions are the result of acquired resistance due to the occurrence of secondary c-KIT mutations, especially in GISTs with primary exon 11 mutations.

Avapritinib is a novel, potent KIT/PDGFRA inhibitor with substantial clinical activity in patients with the D842V genotype. To date, only a minority of PDGFRA-mutant patients treated with avapritinib have developed secondary resistance. Tumor and plasma biopsies in 6 of 7 patients with PDGFRA primary mutations who progressed on avapritinib or imatinib had secondary resistance mutations within PDGFRA exons 13, 14, and 15 that interfere with avapritinib binding.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable GIST and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status </=2 and initiated avapritinib at 300 mg or 400 mg once daily. Primary endpoints were safety in patients who initiated avapritinib at 300 mg or 400 mg once daily and overall response rate (ORR) in patients in the safety population with three or more previous lines of TKI therapy. RESULTS: As of November 16, 2018, in the safety population (n = 204), the most common adverse events (AEs) were nausea (131 [64%]), fatigue (113 [55%]), anemia (102 [50%]), cognitive effects (84 [41%]), and periorbital edema (83 [41%]); 17 (8%) patients discontinued due to treatment-related AEs, most frequently confusion, encephalopathy, and fatigue.

METHODS: NAVIGATOR is a two-part, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion, phase 1 study done at 17 sites across nine countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, South Korea, Spain, the UK, and the USA). Patients aged 18 years or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and with adequate end-organ function were eligible to participate. The dose-escalation part of the study included patients with unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours. The dose-expansion part of the study included patients with an unresectable PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour regardless of previous therapy or gastrointestinal stromal tumour with other mutations that either progressed on imatinib and one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or only received imatinib previously.

Oral avapritinib was administered once daily in the dose-escalation part (starting dose of 30 mg, with increasing dose levels once daily in continuous 28-day cycles until the maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase 2 dose was determined; in the dose-expansion part, the starting dose was the maximum tolerated dose from the dose-escalation part). Primary endpoints were maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase 2 dose, and safety in the dose-escalation part, and overall response and safety in the dose-expansion part. Safety was assessed in all patients from the dose-escalation part and all patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour in the dose-expansion part, and activity was assessed in all patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour who received avapritinib and who had at least one target lesion and at least one post-baseline disease assessment by central radiology. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02508532. FINDINGS: Between Oct 26, 2015, and Nov 16, 2018 (data cutoff), 46 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation part, including 20 patients with a PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour, and 36 patients with a PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour were enrolled in the dose-expansion part. At data cutoff (Nov 16, 2018), 38 (46%) of 82 patients in the safety population (median follow-up of 19.1 months [IQR 9.2-25.5]) and 37 (66%) of the 56 patients in the PDGFRA D842V population (median follow-up of 15.9 months [IQR 9.2-24.9]) remained on treatment. The maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg, and the recommended phase 2 dose was 300 mg. In the safety population (patients with PDGFRA D842V-mutant gastrointestinal stromal tumour from the dose-escalation and dose-expansion parts, all doses), treatment-related grade 3-4 events occurred in 47 (57%) of 82 patients, the most common being anaemia (14 [17%]); there were no treatment-related deaths. In the PDGFRA D842V-mutant population, 49 (88%; 95% CI 76-95) of 56 patients had an overall response, with five (9%) complete responses and 44 (79%) partial responses. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at doses of 30-400 mg per day. At 600 mg, two patients had dose-limiting toxicities (grade 2 hypertension, dermatitis acneiform, and memory impairment in patient 1, and grade 2 hyperbilirubinaemia in patient 2).

The majority of patients with advanced GIST ultimately become resistant to TKI due to acquisition of secondary KIT mutations, whereas primary resistance is mainly caused by PDGFRA p.D842V mutation. We tested the activity of avapritinib, a potent and highly selective inhibitor of mutated KIT and PDGFRA, in three patient-derived xenograft (PDX) GIST models carrying different KIT mutations, with differential sensitivity to standard TKI.Experimental Design: NMRI nu/nu mice (n = 93) were transplanted with human GIST xenografts with KIT exon 11+17 (UZLX-GIST9 (KIT 11+17) ), exon 11 (UZLX-GIST3 (KIT 11) ), or exon 9 (UZLX-GIST2B (KIT9) ) mutations, respectively. We compared avapritinib (10 and 30 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle, imatinib (50 mg/kg/bid) or regorafenib (30 mg/kg/once daily; UZLX-GIST9 (KIT11+17) ); avapritinib (10, 30, 100 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle or imatinib [UZLX-GIST3 (KIT11) ]; and avapritinib (10, 30, 60 mg/kg/once daily) versus vehicle, imatinib (50, 100 mg/kg/twice daily), or sunitinib (40 mg/kg/once daily; UZLX-GIST2B (KIT9) ). RESULTS: In all models, avapritinib resulted in reduction of tumor volume, significant inhibition of proliferation, and reduced KIT signaling. In two models, avapritinib led to remarkable histologic responses, increase in apoptosis, and inhibition of MAPK-phosphorylation. Avapritinib showed superior (UZLX-GIST9 (KIT 11+17) and -GIST2B (KIT 9) ) or equal (UZLX-GIST3 (KIT 11) ) antitumor activity to the standard dose of imatinib.

We assessed the safety of avapritinib and provide evidence-based guidance on management of avapritinib-associated adverse events (AEs), including cognitive effects and intracranial bleeding. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a post hoc analysis of data from a two-part, single-arm dose escalation/expansion phase I study (NAVIGATOR; NCT02508532) in patients with U/M GISTs treated with oral avapritinib 30-600 mg once daily. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability; the impact of dose modification (interruption and/or reduction) on progression-free survival (PFS) was a secondary endpoint. Efficacy analyses were limited to patients who started avapritinib at 300 mg (approved dose). RESULTS: Of 250 patients enrolled in the study, 74.0% presented with KIT mutation and 24.8% presented with PDGFRA exon 18-mutation; 66.8% started avapritinib at 300 mg. The most common treatment-related AEs (any grade) were nausea (59.2%), fatigue (50.0%), periorbital edema (42.0%), anemia (39.2%), diarrhea (36.0%), vomiting (36.0%), and increased lacrimation (30.8%). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Among 167 patients starting on 300 mg avapritinib, all-cause cognitive effects rate (grade 1-2) was 37.0% in all patients and 52.0% in patients >/=65 years. Cognitive effects improved to a lower grade more quickly with dose modification (1.3-3.1 weeks) than without (4.9-7.6 weeks). Median PFS was 11.4 months with dose modification and 7.2 months without. CONCLUSION: Tolerability-guided dose modification of avapritinib is an effective strategy for managing AEs in patients with GISTs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Early recognition of adverse events and tailored dose modification appear to be effective approaches for managing treatment-related adverse events and maintaining patients on avapritinib. Dose reduction does not appear to result in reduced efficacy. Patients' cognitive function should be assessed at baseline and monitored carefully throughout treatment with avapritinib for the onset of cognitive adverse events.

Therefore, we have explored the drug repositioning approach to identify candidate modulators of ABCB1 and ABCG2 from tyrosine kinase inhibitors with known pharmacological properties and anticancer activities. In this study, we discovered that avapritinib (BLU-285), a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor against mutant forms of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), attenuates the transport function of both ABCB1 and ABCG2.

METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of circ-KIAA0907, microRNA (miR)-96-5p, and unc-13 homolog C (UNC13C). Transwell assay, flow cytometry, and colony formation assay were employed to measure the migration, invasion, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity of cells. Besides, glucose uptake, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were determined to evaluate the glycolysis ability of cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were performed to confirm the interactions among circ-KIAA0907, miR-96-5p, and UNC13C.

In the terms of mechanism, circ-KIAA0907 could sponge miR-96-5p to regulate UNC13C expression. MiR-96-5p overexpression could reverse the inhibitory effect of circ-KIAA0907 on OSCC progression, and UNC13C knockdown also could overturn the suppressive effect of miR-96-5p inhibitor on OSCC progression.

The most explored function of circRNAs is as master regulators of gene expression that act to sequester or  sponge  other gene expression regulators, in particular miRNAs. They have also been demonstrated to function via direct modulation of transcription, and by interfering with splicing mechanisms.

METHODS: Primary human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPF-a) were utilized, combined with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays. LC3B-LV-RFP lentivirus was used to evaluate the role of autophagy. The CRISPR/Cas9 system was applied to specifically knock down HECTD1, combined with MTT, BrdU, and migration assays, to explore the functional changes induced by SiO(2).

They were originally thought to represent errors in splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. Unlike linear RNA, the 3' and 5' ends normally present in an RNA molecule have been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization. Interestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and relatively stable in the cytoplasm. These features confer numerous potential functions to circRNAs, such as acting as miRNA sponges, or binding to RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene transcription. It has been proposed that circRNA regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level by interacting with miRNAs and that circRNAs may have a role in regulating miRNA function in cancer initiation and progression. circRNAs appear to be more often downregulated in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue and this may be due to (i) errors in the back-splice machinery in malignant tissues, (ii) degradation of circRNAs by deregulated miRNAs in tumor tissue, or (iii) increasing cell proliferation leading to a reduction of circRNAs. circRNAs have been identified in exosomes and more recently, chromosomal translocations in cancer have been shown to generate aberrant fusion-circRNAs associated with resistance to drug treatments.

This results from the low abundance and highly specific expression of circRNAs, and varying sequencing methods, data-analysis pipelines, and circRNA detection tools. A second major issue is the use of ambiguous nomenclature. Thus, redundant or even conflicting names for circRNAs across different databases contribute to the reproducibility crisis. Third, circRNA databases, in essence, rely on the position of the circRNA back-splice junction, whereas alternative splicing could result in circRNAs with different length and sequence.

Modern imaging techniques at the molecular scale rely on utilizing novel coherent light sources like X-ray free electron lasers for the ultimate goal of visualizing such objects as individual biomolecules rather than crystals. Here, unlike in the case of crystals where structures can be solved by model building and phase refinement, the phase distribution of the wave scattered by an individual molecule must directly be recovered. There are two well-known solutions to the phase problem: holography and coherent diffraction imaging (CDI). Both techniques have their pros and cons. In holography, the reconstruction of the scattered complex-valued object wave is directly provided by a well-defined reference wave that must cover the entire detector area which often is an experimental challenge. CDI provides the highest possible, only wavelength limited, resolution, but the phase recovery is an iterative process which requires some pre-defined information about the object and whose outcome is not always uniquely-defined. Moreover, the diffraction patterns must be recorded under oversampling conditions, a pre-requisite to be able to solve the phase problem. Here, we report how holography and CDI can be merged into one superior technique: holographic coherent diffraction imaging (HCDI). An inline hologram can be recorded by employing a modified CDI experimental scheme. We demonstrate that the amplitude of the Fourier transform of an inline hologram is related to the complex-valued visibility, thus providing information on both, the amplitude and the phase of the scattered wave in the plane of the diffraction pattern. With the phase information available, the condition of oversampling the diffraction patterns can be relaxed, and the phase problem can be solved in a fast and unambiguous manner.

However, during an imaging pulse, the fast laser-induced ionization may strongly affect the recorded diffraction pattern of the irradiated sample. The radiation tolerance of the imaged molecule should then be investigated a priori with a dedicated simulation tool. The continuum approach is a powerful tool for modeling the evolution of irradiated large systems consisting of more than a few hundred thousand atoms. However, this method follows the evolution of average single-particle densities, and the experimentally recorded intensities reflect the spatial two-particle correlations. The information on these correlations is then inherently not accessible within the continuum approach. In this paper we analyze this limitation of continuum models and discuss the applicability of continuum models for imaging studies. We derive a formula to calculate scattered intensities (including both elastic and inelastic scattering) from the estimates obtained with a single-particle continuum model under conditions typical for CDI studies with XFELs. We demonstrate through numerical simulations that it describes the scattered signal with good accuracy. Two-particle correlation effects manifest themselves only in the region of low momentum transfers, together with the effects of the finite size of the sample. We also show that inelastic scattering on bound electrons can have a significant impact on the measured intensities: it contributes to the background that reduces the contrast of the recorded image. This effect is even more pronounced at larger momentum transfers. Therefore, whereas inelastic scattering can be neglected for nanocrystals, where Bragg scattering dominates, and in experiments imaging single objects at low resolution, it should be taken into account when planning atomic resolution imaging of nonperiodic samples. Finally, we show the effect of the electronic damage on the recorded total signal. Progressing damage does not change the positions of intensity peaks that correspond to the (fixed) positions of imaged ions. It only changes the contrast between intensity minima and maxima, which reduces the image contrast.

Diffusion tensor imaging has been and will continue to be an important tool for imaging white matter in the brain, and will be reviewed here. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that holoprosencephaly can be associated with delays or abnormalities in myelination. The functional implications of white matter abnormalities in children with holoprosencephaly is only beginning to be understood. SUMMARY: Modern neuroimaging has led to a better appreciation of the variability seen in holoprosencephaly, an anomaly known to have multiple etiologies.

Both TRalpha2 +/- and -/- mice show a complex phenotype with low levels of free T3 and free T4, and have inappropriately normal levels of TSH. The thyroid glands exhibit mild morphological signs of dysfunction and respond poorly to TSH, suggesting that the genetic changes affect the ability of the gland to release thyroid hormones. However, the phenotype of the mutant mice also has features of hyperthyroidism, including decreased body weight, elevated heart rate, and a raised body temperature. Furthermore, TRalpha2-/- and TRalpha2+/- mice are obese and exhibit skeletal alterations, associated with a late-onset growth retardation.

A novel syndrome called \"multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children\" (MIS-C) shares common clinical features with other well-defined syndromes, including Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome and secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome. Our objective was to develop a protocol for the evaluation, treatment and follow-up of patients with MIS-C. METHODS: The protocol was developed by a multidisciplinary team. We convened a multidisciplinary working group with representation from the departments of paediatric critical care, cardiology, rheumatology, surgery, gastroenterology, haematology, immunology, infectious disease and neurology. Our protocol and recommendations were based on the literature and our experiences with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. After an agreement was reached and the protocol was implemented, revisions were made on the basis of expert feedback. CONCLUSION: Children may experience acute cardiac decompensation or other organ system failure due to this severe inflammatory condition. Therefore, patients with severe symptoms of MIS-C should be managed in a paediatric intensive care setting, as rapid clinical deterioration may occur. Therapeutic approaches for MIS-C should be tailored depending on the patients' phenotypes.

A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has recently been described. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the imaging findings of MIS-C associated with COVID-19. METHODS. Imaging studies and medical records of patients (age range, 0-20 years) admitted with MIS-C between April 22 and May 21, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Thoracic imaging studies were evaluated for parenchymal, mediastinal and hilar, and cardiovascular abnormalities. Abdominal imaging studies were evaluated for abnormalities of solid viscera, hollow viscera, and the peritoneum as well as the mesentery and retroperitoneum. Studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists, and disagreements were resolved by a third senior radiologist. RESULTS. Sixteen patients (10 male and six female patients; age range, 20 months-20 years) were included in this study. All 16 patients presented with fever. Other presenting signs and symptoms included the following: vomiting (12/16, 75%), abdominal pain (11/16, 69%), rash (10/16, 63%), conjunctivitis (8/16, 50%), diarrhea (7/16, 44%), headache (6/16, 38%), and sore throat (5/16, 31%). Shortness of breath and cough were each present in one patient. Chest radiography showed cardiomegaly (10/16, 63%), congestive heart failure or cardiogenic pulmonary edema (9/16, 56%), atelectasis (9/16, 56%), pleural effusions (7/16, 44%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (2/16, 13%), and pneumonia (1/16, 6%). Eight patients (50%) were evaluated for pulmonary embolism (PE) (six [75%] by CT angiography [CTA] and two [25%] by ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy). In two of the eight patients (25%), CTA showed a segmental PE. Abdominal imaging findings (ultrasound, CT, and radiography) included small-volume ascites (6/16, 38%), hepatomegaly (6/16, 38%), echogenic kidneys (5/16, 31%), bowel wall thickening (3/16, 19%), gallbladder wall thickening (3/16, 19%), mesenteric lymphadenopathy (2/16, 13%), splenomegaly (1/16, 6%), and bladder wall thickening (1/16, 6%). The frequencies of findings based on all the reviewed modalities were as follows: cardiomegaly (12/16, 75%), pleural effusion (10/16, 63%), and atelectasis (10/16, 63%). Absolute interobserver agreement was 0.69-1 for thoracic findings and 0.17-1 for abdominal findings. Fifteen patients (94%) were discharged from the hospital (length of hospital stay: range, 3-20 days), and one patient remained in the hospital at the end of the study period. There were no mortalities. CONCLUSION. MIS-C associated with COVID-19 is characterized predominantly by cardiovascular abnormalities, although solid visceral organ, gallbladder, and bowel abnormalities as well as ascites are also seen, reflecting a multisystemic inflammatory process.

OBJECTIVE: With this study we aimed to shed new light on the pathogenesis of these two SARS-CoV-2-related clinical manifestations. METHODS: We investigated lymphocyte and dendritic cells subsets, chemokine/cytokine profiles and evaluated the neutrophil activity mediators, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and reactive oxygen species (ROS), in 10 children with COVID-19 and 9 with MIS-C at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Patients with MIS-C showed higher plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), MPO, IL-6, and of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and CCL2 than COVID-19 children. In addition, they displayed higher levels of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, mainly induced by IFN-gamma. By contrast, we detected IFN-alpha in plasma of children with COVID-19, but not in patients with MIS-C. This observation was consistent with the increase of ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNAs in cells of COVID-19 patients, while ISG15 and IFIT1 mRNA were detected in MIS-C at levels comparable to healthy controls. Moreover, quantification of the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which constitute the main source of IFN-alpha, showed profound depletion of this subset in MIS-C, but not in COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a pattern of immune response which is suggestive of type I interferon activation in COVID-19 children, probably related to a recent interaction with the virus, while in MIS-C the immune response is characterized by elevation of the inflammatory cytokines/chemokines IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL8 and of the chemokines CXCL9 and CXL10, which are markers of an active Th1 type immune response.

With only very limited cases reported from the west, MIS-A is considered a rare and serious complication of COVID-19. However, it is not as uncommon as we think. Many cases go undiagnosed for lack of COVID -19 like symptoms and unawareness among treating clinicians about this newer clinical entity. Further, antibody testing and inflammatory markers are not easily available in many of the Indian hospitals especially in rural India where the second wave had been intense, thereby making it difficult for the diagnosis of MIS-A.

There is evidence of an exacerbated inflammatory response with potential systemic injury, and it may present with aspects similar to those of Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome.

The most frequent clinical manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, mucous membrane changes, and cardiac dysfunction.

The diagnosis includes a combination of clinical and laboratory testing. Patients with MIS-C will often have elevated inflammatory markers and may have an abnormal electrocardiogram or echocardiogram.

Treatment should include intravenous immunoglobulin, anticoagulation, and consideration of corticosteroids. Interleukin-1 and/or interleukin-6 blockade may be considered for refractory cases. Aspirin is recommended if there is thrombocytosis or Kawasaki disease-like features on echocardiogram. Patients will generally require admission to an intensive care unit.

RECENT FINDINGS: Antagonism of the IL-1 is highly effective in idiopathic recurrent pericarditis with autoinflammatory features. Currently, available anti-IL-1 agents are anakinra and canakinumab. Rilonacept is another IL-1 antagonist, currently studied in the phase-3 clinical trial RHAPSODY. Available data suggest similar efficacy and safety profiles of these three agents, although only anakinra has been tested in randomized clinical trials. These agents have slightly different pharmacological properties, being canakinumab a specific IL-1ss antagonist while anakinra and rilonacept are unselective IL-1alpha and IL-1ss blockers. To date, there is no evidence that specificity against IL-1ss affects safety and efficacy in patients with relapsing pericarditis, although it has been proposed that unspecific blockage might be useful in severe disease. Anakinra is the first anti-IL-1 agent with well-documented efficacy and safety in adult and pediatric patients with idiopathic relapsing pericarditis. Other anti-IL-1 agents are currently under study. Future research should clarify the optimal duration of therapy and tapering schedule of treatment with these agents. Moreover, biomarkers would be required to understand which patients will benefit from early administration of IL-1 blockers due to refractoriness to conventional therapy and which others will suffer from recurrences during the tapering of these agents.

More than any other cytokine family, the IL-1 family is closely linked to innate inflammatory and immune responses.

This domain, termed \"toll IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain,\" signals as does the IL-1 receptors; therefore, inflammation due to the TLR and the IL-1 families is nearly the same. Fundamental responses such as the induction of cyclo-oxygenase type 2, increased surface expression of cellular adhesion molecules and increased gene expression of a broad number of inflammatory molecules characterizes IL-1 signal transduction as it does for TLR agonists. IL-1beta is the most studied member of the IL-1 family because of its role in mediating autoinflammatory disease. However, a role for IL-1alpha in disease is being validated because of the availability of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to human IL-1alpha. There are presently three approved therapies for blocking IL-1 activity. Anakinra is a recombinant form of the naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist, which binds to the IL-1 receptor and prevents the binding of IL-1beta as well as IL-1alpha. Rilonacept is a soluble decoy receptor that neutralizes primarily IL-1beta but also IL-1alpha. Canakinumab is a human monoclonal antibody that neutralizes only IL-1beta.

METHODS: This multicentre, open-label study enrolled adult patients with idiopathic or postpericardiotomy RP, symptomatic (>/=2 pericarditis recurrences) or corticosteroid (CS) dependent (>/=2 recurrences prior).Patients received rilonacept 320 mg SC load/160 mg SC weekly maintenance in a 6-week base treatment period (TP) followed by an optional 18-week on-treatment extension period (EP) (option to wean background therapy). RESULTS: Outcomes: pericarditis pain (numeric rating scale (NRS)) and inflammation (C reactive protein (CRP)) for symptomatic patients; disease activity after CS taper for CS-dependent patients. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: health-related quality of life (HRQOL), pericarditis manifestations and additional medications. 25 unique patients enrolled, while 23 completed the EP (seven colchicine failures and five CS failures). In symptomatic patients, NRS and CRP decreased; response was observed after first rilonacept dose.

CONCLUSIONS: Rilonacept led to rapid and sustained improvement in pain, inflammation (CRP and pericarditis manifestations) and HRQOL.

We also review the clinically available IL-1 inhibitors, although not currently approved for cardiovascular indications, and discuss other IL-1 inhibitors, not currently approved, as well as oral NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors currently in clinical development. Canakinumab, IL-1beta antibody, prevented the recurrence of ischemic events in patients with prior acute myocardial infarction in a large phase III clinical trial, including 10 061 patients world-wide.

Patients presenting with pericarditis recurrence while receiving standard therapy were enrolled in a 12-week run-in period, during which rilonacept was initiated and background medications were discontinued. Patients who had a clinical response (i.e., met prespecified response criteria) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive continued rilonacept monotherapy or placebo, administered subcutaneously once weekly. The primary efficacy end point, assessed with a Cox proportional-hazards model, was the time to the first pericarditis recurrence. Safety was also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 86 patients with pericarditis pain and an elevated CRP level were enrolled in the run-in period.

Inhibition of HDAC6 results in higher levels of acetylated tubulin and enhanced binding of the motor protein kinesin-1 to tubulin, which promotes transport of cargoes along microtubules. Microtubule-dependent intracellular trafficking may therefore be regulated by modulating the activity of HDAC6. We have shown previously that the neuromodulator serotonin increases mitochondrial movement in hippocampal neurons via the Akt-GSK3beta signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate a role for HDAC6 in this signaling pathway. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that the presence of tubacin, a specific HDAC6 inhibitor, dramatically enhanced mitochondrial movement in hippocampal neurons, whereas niltubacin, an inactive tubacin analog, had no effect. Compared to control cultures, higher levels of acetylated tubulin were found in neurons treated with tubacin, and more kinesin-1 was associated with mitochondria isolated from these neurons. Inhibition of GSK3beta decreased cytoplasmic deacetylase activity and increased tubulin acetylation, whereas blockade of Akt, which phosphorylates and down-regulates GSK3beta, increased cytoplasmic deacetylase activity and decreased tubulin acetylation. Concordantly, the administration of 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT (a specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist), or fluoxetine (a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor) increased tubulin acetylation. GSK3beta was found to co-localize with HDAC6 in hippocampal neurons, and inhibition of GSK3beta resulted in decreased binding of antibody to phosphoserine-22, a potential GSK3beta phosphorylation site in HDAC6. GSK3beta may therefore regulate HDAC6 activity by phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that HDAC6 plays an important role in the modulation of mitochondrial transport. The link between HDAC6 and GSK3beta, established here, has important implications for our understanding of neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, abnormal mitochondrial transport, which has been observed in such disorders as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, could result from the misregulation of HDAC6 by GSK3beta.

To further delineate the mechanisms contributing to this effect, we demonstrate that inhibition of p110alpha increases NT granule trafficking by up-regulating alpha-tubulin acetylation; NT secretion is prevented by overexpression of HDAC6, an alpha-tubulin deacetylase.

Moreover, acetylation of alpha-tubulin is under the control of the acetyltransferase MEC-17 and deacetylases SIRT2 (Sirtuin 2) and HDAC6 (histone deacetylase 6). Adipocyte development is inhibited in MEC-17-knockdown cells, but enhanced in MEC-17-overexpressing cells. Finally, we show that katanin, a microtubule-severing protein with enhanced activity on acetylated alpha-tubulin, is actively involved in adipogenesis. We propose that co-ordinated up-regulation of alpha-tubulin acetylation initiates cytoskeleton remodelling by promoting alpha-tubulin severing by katanin which, in turn, allows expansion of lipid droplets and accelerates the morphological transition toward mature adipocytes.", "mesh_terms": ["3T3-L1 Cells", "Acetylation", "Acetyltransferases", "Adenosine Triphosphatases", "Adipocytes", "Adipogenesis", "Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cytoskeleton", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Histone Deacetylase 6", "Histone Deacetylases", "Katanin", "Lipid Metabolism", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microtubules", "Mutant Proteins", "Sirtuin 2", "Tubulin", "Up-Regulation"]}, {"pmid": "17574768", "title": "Mammalian Sir2-related protein (SIRT) 2-mediated modulation of resistance to axonal degeneration in slow Wallerian degeneration mice: a crucial role of tubulin deacetylation.", "abstract": "It has been shown that Wallerian degeneration, an anterograde degeneration of transected axons, is markedly delayed in a mutant mouse called slow Wallerian degeneration (Wld(S)).

Acetylation of the epsilon-amino group of Lys-40 of alpha-tubulin marks stable microtubules, although the causal relationship between tubulin acetylation and microtubule stability has remained poorly understood. HDAC6, the tubulin deacetylase, plays a key role in maintaining typical distribution of acetylated microtubules in cells. Here, by using tubastatin A, an HDAC6-specific inhibitor, and siRNA-mediated depletion of HDAC6, we have explored whether tubulin acetylation has a role in regulating microtubule stability. We found that whereas both pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 as well as its depletion enhance microtubule acetylation, only pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 activity leads to an increase in microtubule stability against cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerizing conditions. Tubastatin A treatment suppressed the dynamics of individual microtubules in MCF-7 cells and delayed the reassembly of depolymerized microtubules. Interestingly, both the localization of HDAC6 on microtubules and the amount of HDAC6 associated with polymeric fraction of tubulin were found to increase in the tubastatin A-treated cells compared with the control cells, suggesting that the pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 enhances the binding of HDAC6 to microtubules. The evidence presented in this study indicated that the increased binding of HDAC6, rather than the acetylation per se, causes microtubule stability.

We show that the HAT dTip60 is concentrated both pre and post-synaptically within the NMJ. Presynaptic targeted reduction of dTip60 HAT activity causes a significant increase in synaptic bouton number that specifically affects type Is boutons. The excess boutons show a suppression of the active zone synaptic function marker bruchpilot, suggesting defects in neurotransmission function. Analysis of microtubule organization within these excess boutons using immunohistochemical staining to the microtubule associated protein futsch reveals a significant increase in the rearrangement of microtubule loop architecture that is required for bouton division.

This study was aimed at identifying the mechanism responsible for increased microtubule acetylation. We examined the expression of two known microtubule deacetylases, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and Sirtuin T2 (SirT2), in WIF-B cells. Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and assays using the SirT2 inhibitor nicotinamide revealed that WIF-B cells do not express SirT2. In contrast, HDAC6 was highly expressed in WIF-B cells. Addition of trichostatin A (TSA), an HDAC6 inhibitor, induced microtubule acetylation to the same extent as in ethanol-treated cells (approximately threefold). Although immunofluorescence labeling revealed that HDAC6 distribution did not change in ethanol-treated cells, immunoblotting showed HDAC6 protein levels slightly decreased. HDAC6 solubility was increased in nocodazole-treated cells, suggesting impaired microtubule binding. Direct microtubule binding assays confirmed this hypothesis. The decreased microtubule binding was partially prevented by 4-methyl pyrazole, indicating the effect was in part mediated by acetaldehyde. Interestingly, HDAC6 from ethanol-treated cells was able to bind and deacetylate exogenous tubulin to the same extent as control, suggesting that ethanol-induced tubulin modifications prevented HDAC6 binding to endogenous microtubules.

This is the case for the growth factor independent 1b (GFI1B) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines. DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate GFI1B regulation, we searched for multispecies conserved non-coding elements between GFI1B and neighboring genes. We used a formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) assay and DNase1 hypersensitivity to assess the chromatin conformation of these sites. Next, we analyzed transcription factor binding and histone modifications at the GFI1B locus including the conserved non-coding elements by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, we studied the interaction of the GFI1B promoter and the conserved non-coding elements with the chromatin conformation capture technique and used immunofluorescence to evaluate GFI1B levels in individual cells. RESULTS: We localized several conserved non-coding elements containing multiple erythroid specific transcription factor binding sites at the GFI1B locus. In GFI1B-expressing cells a subset of these conserved non-coding elements and the promoter adopt a close spatial conformation, localize with open chromatin sites, harbor chromatin modifications associated with gene activation and bind multiple transcription factors and co-repressors. Conclusions Our findings indicate that GFI1B regulatory elements behave as activators and repressors. Different protein levels within a cell population suggest that cells must activate and repress GFI1B continuously to control its final level. These data are consistent with a model of GFI1B regulation in which GFI1B binds to its own promoter and to the conserved non-coding elements as its levels rise.

Lynch syndrome is a familial cancer syndrome that can be caused by the autosomal dominant inheritance of splice site mutations in the MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) gene. To better understand the role of nucleosomes in splicing, we used MLH1 splice site mutations in Lynch syndrome cases as a model to investigate if abnormal splicing was associated with altered nucleosome positioning at exon-intron boundaries. FINDINGS: Nucleosome Occupancy and Methylome sequencing (NOMe-seq) was used to determine the allele-specific positioning of nucleosomes around heterozygous splice site mutations in lymphoblastoid cells lines (LCLs) derived from six Lynch syndrome patients. These mutations were previously shown to cause exon skipping in five of the six patients. Allele-specific high-resolution nucleosome mapping across exons and exon-intron boundaries revealed high levels of nucleosomes across all regions examined. Alleles containing donor or acceptor splice site mutations showed no consistent alteration in nucleosome positioning or occupancy. CONCLUSION: Nucleosomes were enriched at MLH1 exons in LCLs derived from Lynch syndrome patients, and in this model system the positioning of nucleosomes was unaltered at exon-intron boundaries containing splice site mutations.

However, the debate on whether or not DNA methylation is a reliable indicator of high nucleosome occupancy has not been settled. For example, the methylation levels of DNA flanking CTCF sites are higher in linker DNA than in nucleosomal DNA, while other studies have shown that the nucleosome core is the preferred site of methylation. In this study, we make progress toward understanding these conflicting phenomena by implementing a bioinformatics approach that combines MNase-seq and NOMe-seq data and by comprehensively profiling DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy throughout the human genome. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that increasing methylated CpG density is correlated with nucleosome occupancy in the total genome and within nearly all subgenomic regions. Features with elevated methylated CpG density such as exons, SINE-Alu sequences, H3K36-trimethylated peaks, and methylated CpG islands are among the highest nucleosome occupied elements in the genome, while some of the lowest occupancies are displayed by unmethylated CpG islands and unmethylated transcription factor binding sites. Additionally, outside of CpG islands, the density of CpGs within nucleosomes was shown to be important for the nucleosomal location of DNA methylation with low CpG frequencies favoring linker methylation and high CpG frequencies favoring core particle methylation. Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome.

Our reporter assays and gene reactivation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, show that DNA methylation occurring at CpG poor LAMB3 promoter and RUNX3 promoter 1(RUNX3 P1) can directly lead to transcriptional silencing in cells competent to express these genes in vitro.

We find that the genomic location of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) is mostly cell type specific and preferentially found at enhancers in normal cells. In cancer cells, however, we observe a global reconfiguration of NDRs at distal regulatory elements coupled with a substantial reorganization of the cancer methylome. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Remarkably, we show that nucleosomes remain strongly organized and phased at many facultative distal regulatory elements, even in the absence of a NDR as an anchor. Finally, we find that key transcription factor (TF) binding sites also show extensive peripheral nucleosome phasing, suggesting the potential for TFs to organize NDRs genome-wide and contribute to deregulation of cancer epigenomes.

METHODS: Digital images of the right and left hand palms of patients diagnosed with GCA (n=57, 42 males, 15 females) and age and sex-matched controls (n=59, 41 males, 18 females) were obtained.

This study aims to investigate the 2D:4D ratio as a potential marker for prostate cancer severity.

Mutations in alpha-tropomyosin (TPM1), a thin filament protein involved in structural and regulatory roles in muscle cells, are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and very rarely with DCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we present a large four-generation family in which DCM is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Six family members have a cardiomyopathy with the age of diagnosis ranging from 5 months to 52 years. The youngest affected was diagnosed with dilated and non-compaction cardiomyopathy (NCCM) and died at the age of five. Three additional children died young of suspected heart problems. We mapped the phenotype to chromosome 15 and subsequently identified a missense mutation in TPM1, resulting in a p.D84N amino acid substitution.

The mutation co-segregates with all clinically affected family members and significantly weakens the binding of tropomyosin to actin by 25%. CONCLUSIONS: We show that a mutation in TPM1 is associated with DCM and a lethal, early onset form of NCCM, probably as a result of diminished actin binding caused by weakened charge-charge interactions.

Rif1 has recently been identified as a genome-wide regulator of replication timing in fission yeast and in mammalian cells.

We have analyzed replication timing by analyzing BrdU incorporation genome-wide, and report that Rif1 regulates the timing of late/dormant replication origins throughout the S. cerevisiae genome. Analysis of pfa4Delta cells, which are defective in palmitoylation and membrane association of Rif1, suggests that replication timing regulation by Rif1 is independent of its role in localizing telomeres to the nuclear periphery. Intra-S checkpoint signaling is intact in rif1Delta cells, and checkpoint-defective mec1Delta cells do not comparably deregulate replication timing, together indicating that Rif1 regulates replication timing through a mechanism independent of this checkpoint.

Deleting RIF1 partially compensates for the limited DDK activity in a cdc7-1 mutant strain by allowing increased, premature phosphorylation of Mcm4. PP1 interaction motifs within the Rif1 N-terminal domain are critical for its repressive effect on replication.

Our results also show that DSM-mediated interactions are the main contributor to the binding free energy and rely on making extensive van der Waals contacts between the GXXXG motifs and hydrophobic residues of DSM and a flat guanine plane. Accordingly, the sterically more accessible 5'-G-tetrad allows for more favorable van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions which leads to the preferential binding of DSM to the 5'-side. In contrast to DSM, OB binds to G4 mostly through polar interactions by flexibly adapting to the 5'-terminal guanine tract to form a number of strong hydrogen bonds with the backbone phosphate groups.

Nevertheless, the mutation is not a null: maternal mutant embryos have intermediate segmentation phenotypes and relatively normal terminal patterning suggesting that the mutant protein retains partial corepressor activity. Our results show that homo-oligomerization of Gro is not obligatory for its action in vivo, and that Gro represses transcription through more than one molecular mechanism.", "mesh_terms": ["Alleles", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Eye", "Gene Deletion", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutant Proteins", "Phenotype", "Protein Structure, Quaternary", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Repressor Proteins", "Transcription, Genetic", "beta-Galactosidase"]}, {"pmid": "19956621", "title": "Cofactor-activated phosphorylation is required for inhibition of cortical neuron differentiation by Groucho/TLE1.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transcriptional co-repressors of the Groucho/transducin-like Enhancer of split (Gro/TLE) family regulate the expression of a variety of genes and are involved in numerous developmental processes in both invertebrate and vertebrate species. More specifically, Gro/TLE1 participates in mechanisms that inhibit/delay the differentiation of cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells into neurons during mammalian forebrain development. The anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1 depends on the formation of protein complexes with specific DNA-binding transcription factors that engage Gro/TLE1 through WRP(W/Y) sequences. Interaction with those transcription partners results in Gro/TLE1 recruitment to selected DNA sites and causes increased Gro/TLE1 phosphorylation. The physiological significance of the latter event, termed \"cofactor-activated phosphorylation,\" had not been determined. Therefore, this study aimed at clarifying the role of cofactor-activated phosphorylation in the anti-neurogenic function of Gro/TLE1. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A combination of site-directed mutagenesis, mass spectrometry, biochemistry, primary cell culture, and immunocytochemical assays was utilized to characterize point mutations of Ser-286, a residue that is phosphorylated in vivo and is located within the serine/proline-rich (SP) domain of Gro/TLE1. Mutation of Ser-286 to alanine or glutamic acid does not perturb the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with DNA-binding partners, including the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hes1, a prototypical anti-neurogenic WRP(W/Y) motif protein. Ser-286 mutations do not prevent the recruitment of Gro/TLE1 to DNA, but they impair cofactor-activated phosphorylation and weaken the interaction of Gro/TLE1 with chromatin. These effects are correlated with an impairment of the anti-neurogenic activity of Gro/TLE1. Similar results were obtained when mutations of Ser-289 and Ser-298, which are also located within the SP domain of Gro/TLE1, were analyzed. CONCLUSION: Based on the positive correlation between Gro/TLE1 cofactor-activated phosphorylation and ability to inhibit cortical neuron differentiation, we propose that hyperphosphorylation induced by cofactor binding plays a positive role in the regulation of Gro/TLE1 anti-neurogenic activity.", "mesh_terms": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Cerebral Cortex", "Chromatin", "Co-Repressor Proteins", "Humans", "Mice", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons", "Peptides", "Phosphorylation", "Point Mutation", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Repressor Proteins", "Serine", "Transcription Factors", "Transfection"]}, {"pmid": "19101520", "title": "Covalent conjugation of Groucho with SUMO-1 modulates its corepressor activity.", "abstract": "Groucho is a corepressor that forms a macromolecular complex for its corepressor activity, in which HDAC1 is an essential component for the modulation of chromatin structure and transcriptional repression of target genes.

In this study, we show that Gro is partially dependent on Rpd3 for repression, supporting the idea that Rpd3-mediated repression is one mode of Gro-mediated repression. We demonstrate that Gro colocalizes with Rpd3 to the chromatin of a target gene and that this is accompanied by the deacetylation of specific lysines within the N-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4. Gro overexpression leads to wing patterning defects and ectopic repression in the wing disc of transcription directed by the vestigial quadrant enhancer. These effects are reversed by the histone deacetylase inhibitors TSA and HC-Toxin and by the reduction of Rpd3 gene dosage. Furthermore, repression of the vestigial quadrant enhancer is accompanied by a Gro-mediated increase in nucleosome density, an effect that is reversed by histone deacetylase inhibitors.

All lethal point mutations in gro map to the conserved regions, leading to speculation that the unconserved central domains are dispensable. However, our sequence analysis suggests that the central domains are disordered leading us to suspect that the lack of lethal mutations in this region reflects a lack of order rather than an absence of essential functions. In support of this conclusion, genomic rescue experiments with Gro deletion variants demonstrate that the GP and CcN domains are required for viability. Misexpression assays using these same deletion variants show that the SP domain prevents unrestrained and promiscuous repression by Gro, while the GP and CcN domains are indispensable for repression. Deletion of the GP domain leads to loss of nuclear import, while deletion of the CcN domain leads to complete loss of repression. Changes in Gro activity levels reset the threshold concentrations at which graded repressors silence target gene expression.

To resolve this we have used genomic engineering to generate a series of brk mutants that are unable to recruit Gro, CtBP and/or have 3R deleted. These reveal that although the recruitment of Gro is necessary and can be sufficient for Brk to make an almost morphologically wild-type fly, it is insufficient during oogenesis, where Brk must utilize CtBP and 3R to pattern the egg shell appropriately.

At the age of 12 years, serum K+ was 3.0 mmol/l and creatinine reached 2.0 mg/dl. On admission, his blood pressure was normal but volume status was depleted. Urinalysis was essentially normal. Biochemical studies showed hypokalemia (K+ 2.4 mmol/l) with a high transtubular K+ gradient (TTKG) 9.6, metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 28.4 mmol/l), normomagnesemia (2.0 mg/dl), severe renal failure (BUN 94 mg/dl, Cr 6.3 mg/dl), and hypocalciuria (urine calcium/creatinine ratio 0.02 mg/mg). Abdominal sonography revealed bilateral small size kidneys without nephrocalcinosis or renal stones. After the withdrawal of indomethacin with regular KCl and adequate fluid supplementation for 1 year, serum creatinine and K+ levels have been maintained at 4.0 mg/dl and 3.3 mmol/l, respectively. Direct sequencing of NKCC2, ROMK, ClC-Kb, and NCCT in this patient disclosed a novel homozygous missense mutation (GGG to GAG, G470E) in CLCNKB. This G470E mutation was not identified in 100 healthy Chinese subjects. Long-term therapy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), prolonged hypokalemia, chronic volume depletion, and underlying genetic variety may contribute to the deterioration of his renal function. The cautious use of NSAIDs, aggressive correction of hypokalemia, and avoidance of severe volume depletion may prevent the irreversible renal damage in patients with BS due to a Cl- channel defect.", "mesh_terms": ["Adolescent", "Chloride Channels", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Hypokalemia", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Mutation, Missense", "Point Mutation", "Sodium-Potassium-Chloride Symporters", "Solute Carrier Family 12, Member 1", "Syndrome"]}, {"pmid": "15056980", "title": "Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes: from gene to clinic.", "abstract": "Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes are characterized by hypokalemia, normal to low blood pressure and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis.

The wide spectrum of functional severity of CLCNKB mutations may contribute to the phenotypic variability, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been established. Low-level expression of the human ClC-Kb channel in mammalian cells impedes the functional study of CLCNKB mutations, and the underlying cause is still unclear. The human ClC-Kb channel is highly degraded by proteasome in human embryonic kidney cells. The C-terminal in-frame green fluorescent protein fusion may slow down the proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Barttin co-expression necessarily improves the stability, membrane trafficking and gating of ClC-Kb. CLCNKB mutations in barttin-binding sites, dimer interface or selectivity filter often have severe functional consequences. The remaining chloride conductance of the ClC-Kb mutant channel significantly correlates with the phenotypes, such as age at diagnosis, plasma chloride concentration, and the degree of calciuria in patients with classic BS. ABSTRACT: Mutations in the CLCNKB gene encoding the human voltage-gated chloride ClC-Kb (hClC-Kb) channel cause classic Bartter's syndrome (BS). In contrast to antenatal BS, classic BS manifests with highly variable phenotypes. The functional severity of the mutant channel has been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Due to difficulties in the expression of hClC-Kb in heterologous expression systems, the functional consequences of mutant channels have not been thoroughly examined, and the genotype-phenotype association has not been established. In this study, we found that hClC-Kb, when expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, was unstable due to degradation by proteasome. In-frame fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to the C-terminus of the channel may ameliorate proteasome degradation. Co-expression of barttin increased protein abundance and membrane trafficking of hClC-Kb and markedly increased functional chloride current. We then functionally characterized 18 missense mutations identified in our classic BS cohort and others using HEK cells expressing hClC-Kb-GFP. Most CLCNKB mutations resulted in marked reduction in protein abundance and chloride current, especially those residing at barttin binding sites, dimer interface and selectivity filter. We enrolled classic BS patients carrying homozygous missense mutations with well-described functional consequences and clinical presentations for genotype-phenotype analysis. We found significant correlations of mutant chloride current with the age at diagnosis, plasma chloride concentration and urine calcium excretion rate. In conclusion, hClC-Kb expression in HEK cells is susceptible to proteasome degradation, and fusion of GFP to the C-terminus of hClC-Kb improves protein expression. The functional severity of the CLCNKB mutation is an important determinant of the phenotype in classic BS.", "mesh_terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Bartter Syndrome", "Child", "Chloride Channels", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Infant", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Young Adult"]}]}, {"question": "Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?", "answer": "Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions.

Nevertheless, in worms and humans, we only detected modest proportions of linked editing events, the majority of which were not conserved. Furthermore, the linkage of editing in coding regions of worms and humans might be overall deleterious, which drives the evolution of DNA sites to escape promiscuous editing.

Editing is enriched in the nervous system, affecting molecules pertinent for excitability and neuronal morphology.

Nuclear mRNAs in metazoans also undergo editing (adenosine-to-inosine or 'A-to-I' substitutions), and most of these edits appear to be nonadaptive 'misfirings' of adenosine deaminases. However, recent analysis of cephalopod transcriptomes found that many editing sites are shared by anciently divergent lineages within this group, suggesting they play some adaptive role. Recent discoveries have also revealed that some fungi have an independently evolved A-to-I editing mechanism, resulting in extensive recoding of their nuclear mRNAs. Here, phylogenetic comparisons were used to determine whether RNA editing generally restores ancestral protein sequences or creates derived variants. Unlike in mitochondrial systems, RNA editing in metazoan and fungal nuclear transcripts overwhelmingly leads to novel sequences not found in inferred ancestral proteins.

Since pygmy squid and Nautilus are closely related species they are excellent model organisms to study eye evolution. Having being able to collect Nautilus embryos, we employed next-generation RNA sequencing using Nautilus and pygmy squid developing eyes. Their transcriptomes were compared and analyzed. Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology revealed that contigs related to nucleic acid binding were largely up-regulated in squid, while the ones related to metabolic processes and extracellular matrix-related genes were up-regulated in Nautilus. These differences are most likely correlated with the complexity of tissue organization in these species. Moreover, when the analysis focused on the eye-related contigs several interesting patterns emerged. First, contigs from both species related to eye tissue differentiation and morphogenesis as well as to cilia showed best hits with their Human counterparts, while contigs related to rabdomeric photoreceptors showed the best hit with their Drosophila counterparts. This bolsters the idea that eye morphogenesis genes have been generally conserved in evolution, and compliments other studies showing that genes involved in photoreceptor differentiation clearly follow the diversification of invertebrate (rabdomeric) and vertebrate (ciliated) photoreceptors. Interestingly some contigs showed as good a hit with Drosophila and Human homologues in Nautilus and squid samples.

The pathophysiologic hallmarks consist of insulin resistance and progressive pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. An increased metabolic demand for insulin due to increased insulin resistance usually precedes the development of hyperglycemia. At early stages, pancreatic beta cells compensate for insulin resistance by hypersecretion of insulin. However, the period of beta-cell compensation is followed by beta-cell failure, in which the pancreas fails to secrete sufficient insulin and diabetes ensues.

They have no direct effect on beta-cell function, although some indirect mechanisms of actions may help to preserve beta-cell function or slow beta-cell apoptosis.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Clinical efficacy (change in HbA(1c) and lipids) and baseline cohort parameters were extracted from a 12-month, randomized clinical trial (Derosa et al., 2006) evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of pioglitazone versus rosiglitazone, both in addition to metformin, in adult T2DM patients with insufficient glucose control (n = 96).

Base-case assumptions were assessed through several sensitivity analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes included incremental life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total direct medical costs, cumulative incidence of complications and associated costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Compared to rosiglitazone plus metformin, pioglitazone plus metformin was projected to result in a modest improvement in 0.187 quality-adjusted life-years. Over patients' lifetimes, total direct medical costs were projected to be marginally lower with pioglitazone plus metformin (difference -$526.), largely due to reduced CVD complication costs. While costs were higher among renal, ulcer/amputation/neuropathy, and eye complications in the pioglitazone plus metformin group, the cost savings for CVD complications outweighed their economic impact. Pioglitazone plus metformin was found to be a dominant long-term treatment strategy in the US compared to rosiglitazone plus metformin. Sensitivity analyses showed findings to be robust under almost all scenarios, including short-term time horizons, 6% discounting, removal of individual lipid parameters, and modifications of patient cohort to more closely represent a US T2DM population.

Medication was uptitrated during on-therapy visits based on failure to attain glycaemic target of mean daily glucose less than or equal to 6.1 mmol/l (unless at maximum tolerated dose). Patients were assessed for efficacy and safety at nine visits over a 32-week treatment period. This was a trial designed to show greater efficacy of RSG/MET combination therapy compared with MET or RSG monotherapy. The primary end point was change in A1c from baseline to week 32. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients achieving recommended A1c and FPG targets for glycaemic control and change from baseline in FPG, free fatty acid, lipids, insulin, insulin sensitivity, C-reactive protein and adiponectin. Safety evaluations included adverse-event (AE) monitoring, changes in weight and clinical laboratory evaluations. RESULTS: At week 32, RSG/MET showed significant improvements in A1c from a baseline of 8.9 +/- 1.1% to 6.6 +/- 1.0% at study end, and this 2.3% reduction was significantly greater than the reductions achieved individually with MET (-1.8%; p = 0.0008) and RSG (-1.6%; p < 0.0001). The greatest mean decrease in FPG was seen with RSG/MET (-4.1 mmol/l) and was significant compared with MET (-2.8 mmol/l; p < 0.0001) and RSG (-2.6 mmol/l; p < 0.0001). Target A1c of less than or equal to 6.5% and less than 7% were achieved in more patients in the RSG/MET group (60% and 77%) than with MET (39% and 57%) or RSG (35% and 58%) respectively. Treatment was well tolerated, with nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as the most commonly reported AEs. Oedema was comparable between RSG/MET (6%) and RSG (7%) and lower in the MET group (3%). No new safety and tolerability issues were observed in the RSG/MET group. CONCLUSIONS: As first-line therapy in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, RSG/MET fixed-dose combination therapy achieved significant reductions in A1c and FPG compared with either RSG or MET monotherapy. RSG/MET was generally well tolerated as initial therapy, with no new tolerability issues identified with the fixed-dose combination.", "mesh_terms": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Combinations", "Female", "Glycated Hemoglobin", "Humans", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Lipids", "Male", "Metformin", "Middle Aged", "Rosiglitazone", "Thiazoles", "Thiazolidinediones", "Treatment Outcome"]}, {"pmid": "20840734", "title": "A systems biology approach to identify effective cocktail drugs.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Complex diseases, such as Type 2 Diabetes, are generally caused by multiple factors, which hamper effective drug discovery. To combat these diseases, combination regimens or combination drugs provide an alternative way, and are becoming the standard of treatment for complex diseases. However, most of existing combination drugs are developed based on clinical experience or test-and-trial strategy, which are not only time consuming but also expensive. RESULTS: In this paper, we presented a novel network-based systems biology approach to identify effective drug combinations by exploiting high throughput data. We assumed that a subnetwork or pathway will be affected in the networked cellular system after a drug is administrated. Therefore, the affected subnetwork can be used to assess the drug's overall effect, and thereby help to identify effective drug combinations by comparing the subnetworks affected by individual drugs with that by the combination drug. In this work, we first constructed a molecular interaction network by integrating protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and signaling pathways. A new model was then developed to detect subnetworks affected by drugs. Furthermore, we proposed a new score to evaluate the overall effect of one drug by taking into account both efficacy and side-effects. As a pilot study we applied the proposed method to identify effective combinations of drugs used to treat Type 2 Diabetes. Our method detected the combination of Metformin and Rosiglitazone, which is actually Avandamet, a drug that has been successfully used to treat Type 2 Diabetes.

Using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we have detected mRNA for the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR) in all 14 of the NSCLC cell lines examined. GRP receptor (GRPR) mRNA was also expressed in the majority of NSCLC cell lines (nine of 14).

METHODS: Carcinoid tumors with pulmonary (no.=9) or intestinal (no.=15) localizations were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, autoradiography, and radioimmunoassay, to examine the presence of bombesin receptor subtypes and determine BLP levels in these tumors. RESULTS: All 3 bombesin receptor subtypes (GRPR, NMBR, and BRS-3) were present on pulmonary and intestinal carcinoids by immunohistochemistry. In pulmonary carcinoids, low receptor ligand binding densities together with high and low BLP levels were found. Intestinal carcinoids showed predominantly high receptor ligand binding densities in combination with low BLP levels. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes is independent from the carcinoid tumor origin, and is therefore not recommended as a distinction marker, although carcinoids of pulmonary and intestinal origin possess different receptor binding affinities for bombesin and dissimilar BLP levels. The combined presence of bombesin and its receptors might suggest the presence of a paracrine or autocrine growth loop in carcinoids.", "mesh_terms": ["Bombesin", "Carcinoid Tumor", "Humans", "Intestinal Neoplasms", "Ligands", "Lung Neoplasms", "Protein Isoforms", "Receptors, Bombesin"]}, {"pmid": "22828605", "title": "The molecular basis for high affinity of a universal ligand for human bombesin receptor (BnR) family members.", "abstract": "There is increased interest in the Bn-receptor family because they are frequently over/ectopically expressed by tumors and thus useful as targets for imaging or receptor-targeted-cytotoxicity.

However, the molecular basis of this property is unclear and is the subject of this study. To accomplish this, site-directed mutagenesis was used after identifying potentially important amino acids using sequence homology analysis of all BnRs with high affinity for Univ.Lig compared to the Cholecystokinin-receptor (CCK(A)R), which has low affinity. Using various criteria 74 amino acids were identified and 101 mutations made in GRPR by changing each to those of CCK(A)R or to alanine. 22 GRPR mutations showed a significant decrease in affinity for Univ.Lig (>2-fold) with 2 in EC2[D97N, G112V], 1 in UTM6[Y284A], 2 in EC4[R287N, H300S] showing >10-fold decrease in Univ.Lig affinity. Additional mutations were made to explore the molecular basis for these changes. Our results show that high affinity for Univ.Lig by human Bn-receptors requires positively charged amino acids in extracellular (EC)-domain 4 and to a lesser extent EC2 and EC3 suggesting charge-charge interactions may be particularly important for determining the general high affinity of this ligand.

Significant deviations from the parity rules in the third codon letters of the four-codon amino acids result mostly from selective biases rather than mutational biases between the two strands of DNA during evolution. The parity rules lay the foundation for evaluating the biases in synonymous codon usage in terms of (1) directional mutation pressure for variation of the DNA G + C content due to mutational biases between alpha-bases (A or T) and gamma-bases (G or C), (2) strand-bias mutation, for example, by DNA repair during transcription, and (3) functional selection in evolution, for example, due to tRNA abundance. The present analysis shows that, although the PR2 violation is common in the third codon letters of four-codon amino acids, the contribution of PR2 violation to the DNA G + C content of the third codon position is small and, in majority of cases, mildly counteracts the effect of the directional mutation pressure on the G + C content.", "mesh_terms": ["Animals", "Base Composition", "Biological Evolution", "Codon", "DNA", "Mutation", "Plants", "RNA, Transfer", "Selection, Genetic", "Vertebrates"]}, {"pmid": "2326195", "title": "Role of GC-biased mutation pressure on synonymous codon choice in Micrococcus luteus, a bacterium with a high genomic GC-content.", "abstract": "The GC (G + C, or G or C)-contents of codon silent positions in all two-codon sets and three codons AUY/A (IIe), and in most of the family boxes of Micrococcus luteus (genomic GC-content: 74%) are 95% to 100% in both the highly and weakly expressed genes.

These are examples of \"stop codon capture,\" which has been preceded by duplication of tRNA genes followed by nucleotide substitutions in their sequences, including mutational changes in their anticodons. Evolutionary changes in the code may have resulted from disappearance of codons and anticodons resulting from GC pressure and from their reappearance when the direction of the pressure was reversed. In this manner, codon UGA and anticodon UCA for tryptophan could have disappeared under GC pressure and reappeared in Mycoplasma under AT pressure. Stop codon UGA may have been the third of the three stop codons to appear, originating from mutations in UAA. Changes in the code are adaptive and nondeleterious.

Among them, CMT1A (MIM #118220) is most common and is usually associated with a duplication of a 1.5-Mb region on chromosome 17p11.2, which includes peripheral myelin protein 22 gene (PMP22; MIM *601097). Currently, there is no cure or obviously effective disease-modifying treatment for CMT. Two potential effective therapeutic agents for CMT1A were investigated recently. One is ascorbic acid and another is neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), an important component of the Schwann cell autocrine survival loop. Early diagnosis can facilitate CMT patients to modify their life styles timely for minimizing nerve injury to delay or avoid disability. Molecular diagnosis of CMT can provide the basis for appropriate genetic counseling and further CMT research.", "mesh_terms": ["Animals", "Ascorbic Acid", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans"]}, {"pmid": "8655146", "title": "Duplication of the PMP22 gene in 17p partial trisomy patients with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1 neuropathy.", "abstract": "Autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth type-1A neuropathy (CMT1A) is a demyelinating peripheral nerve disorder that is commonly associated with a submicroscopic tandem DNA duplication of a 1.5-Mb region of 17p11.2p12 that contains the peripheral myelin gene PMP22.

We aimed to investigate the frequency of disease-causing heterozygous GDAP1 mutations in ADCMT and their associated phenotype. METHODS: We performed mutation analysis in a large cohort of ADCMT patients by means of bidirectional sequencing of coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of GDAP1. Intragenic GDAP1 deletions were excluded using an allele quantification assay. We confirmed the pathogenic character of one sequence variant by in vitro experiments assaying mitochondrial morphology and function. RESULTS: In 8 Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) families we identified 4 pathogenic heterozygous GDAP1 mutations, 3 of which are novel. Three of the mutations displayed reduced disease penetrance. Disease onset in the affected individuals was variable, ranging from early childhood to adulthood. Disease progression was slow in most patients and overall severity milder than typically seen in autosomal recessive GDAP1 mutations.

According to the primary site of damage, a distinction is made between demyelinating and axonal forms (CMT1 and 2, respectively, when inherited as an autosomal dominant trait). Leucine-rich repeat and sterile alpha motif-containing protein 1 (LRSAM1) is a ubiquitin-protein ligase with a role in sorting internalised cell-surface receptor proteins. So far, mutations in the LRSAM1 gene have been shown to cause axonal CMT in three different families and can confer either dominant or recessive transmission of the disease. CASE PRESENTATION: We have identified a novel mutation in LRSAM1 in a small family with dominant axonal CMT. Electrophysiological studies show evidence of a sensory axonal neuropathy and are interesting in so far as giant motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) are present on needle electromyography (EMG), while motor nerve conduction studies including compound motor action potential (CMAP) amplitudes are completely normal. The underlying mutation c.2046+1G >T results in the loss of a splice donor site and the inclusion of 63 additional base pairs of intronic DNA into the aberrantly spliced transcript. This disrupts the catalytically active RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain of LRSAM1.

Iodine tablets should be taken immediately (preferably not later than a few hours) in situations where inhalation of radioactive iodine may occur.

METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases for full-length articles published in English between 1990 and 2010 that addressed at least 1 of our key questions. RESULTS: We identified 5 clinical practice guidelines pertinent to question 1, and 12 systematic reviews or post-hoc analyses of pooled data that addressed questions 3 through 5. No systematic reviews addressed question 2; however, we identified 4 individual studies addressing this question. Current guidelines do not recommend universal screening for depression in adults, unless staff supports are in place to diagnose, treat, and follow up patients. Reported screening rates ranged from 33% to 84% among women. Several validated screening tools for depression exist; however, their performance among this population is unknown. Screening in high-risk populations may improve the patient's receipt of diagnosis and treatment. Effective treatments include exercise, psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy.

Administering folic acid prior to the administration of (99m)Tc-EF has been shown to improve SPECT images. Here, we conducted a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and radiation dosimetry of (99m)Tc-EF injection following pre-administration of folic acid in healthy Japanese male adults. METHODS: Six healthy Japanese male adults were enrolled in the study. Folic acid was intravenously administered, followed 1-3 min later by an intravenous injection of (99m)Tc-EF (740 MBq +/- 20 %). Assessments of subjective symptoms and objective findings, electrocardiograms, physical examination, and laboratory tests were performed before and up to 7 days after the injection to assess the safety of (99m)Tc-EF. Blood and urine collections and whole-body planar imaging were conducted at various time points up to 24 h after the injection to assess the pharmacokinetics of (99m)Tc-EF. The internal radiation dosimetry was calculated based on the pharmacokinetics results using the MIRD method. RESULTS: Five adverse events were observed in three subjects (50 %) after administration of the folic acid and (99m)Tc-EF, while these events were mild and non-serious. Of those five events, three were considered to be related to the administered agents. The radioactivity in blood rapidly decreased and showed a biphasic profile. The activity of (99m)Tc-EF at 5 min post injection was largest in the bone marrow, followed by the liver and kidneys, and had decreased within 24 h in all organs/tissues without appreciable retention. The pharmacokinetics results suggested that (99m)Tc-EF was mainly eliminated by kidney. The results also suggested that when administered at 925 MBq of (99m)Tc-EF, which is the maximum dose generally used for clinical trials in other countries, the corresponding effective dose of (99m)Tc-EF is equal to or less than those determined for the current radioactive diagnostic imaging agents.

In contrast, targeted imaging agents can identify patients with receptors overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells, thus allowing appropriate selection of patients for personalized treatment with a desirable targeted therapeutic. The folate receptor (FR) has been identified as a new molecularly targeted entity, which is highly overexpressed on the surface of a spectrum of solid tumor cells, including ovarian, kidney, lung, brain, endometrial, colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, prostate, testicular, bladder, head and neck, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer. Folic acid conjugation is a novel approach for targeting FR-expressing tissues for personalized treatment. With the development of FRalpha-targeted therapies comes a concomitant prerequisite for reliable methods for the quantification of FRalpha tissue expression. Therefore, attaching a radioactive probe to folic acid to target diseased tissue has become a novel and powerful imaging technique. Currently available diagnostic tools frequently require invasive surgical biopsy. In contrast, the noninvasive single-photon emission computed tomography-based companion imaging agent, (99m)Tc-etarfolatide ((99m)Tc-EC20), is in development for use as a companion diagnostic with the FRalpha-targeted folate conjugate, vintafolide (EC145), to identify patients whose tumors express FRalpha. Vintafolide is a folic acid conjugate of Vinca alkaloid (desacetylvinblastine hydrazide) that targets FRalpha-expressing tumors, thereby disrupting microtubule polymerization. (99m)Tc-etarfolatide is taken up by FR-positive tumors and allows for noninvasive, whole-body monitoring of FRalpha expression status throughout treatment. The combination of vintafolide plus etarfolatide has been evaluated in three Phase 2 studies for the treatment of various solid tumors, including ovarian, endometrial, peritoneal, and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, as well as lung cancer. Patients with FR-positive tumors, as identified by etarfolatide uptake, have had better clinical outcomes than patients with FR-negative tumors, indicating the potential of etarfolatide as a companion biomarker for predicting vintafolide response. Targeted therapies combined with a reliable companion diagnostic test represent a novel approach toward efficient personalized medicine for malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Furthermore, the recent availability of the crystal structures of FRalpha and FRbeta in complex with folates and antifolates forms a realistic basis for the rational design and implementation of novel FR-targeted drugs for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disorders.", "mesh_terms": ["Animals", "Folic Acid", "Folic Acid Antagonists", "Folic Acid Transporters", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Neoplasms", "Precision Medicine"]}, {"pmid": "24127448", "title": "PRECEDENT: a randomized phase II trial comparing vintafolide (EC145) and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in combination versus PLD alone in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.", "abstract": "PURPOSE: Vintafolide (EC145) is a folic acid-desacetylvinblastine conjugate that binds to the folate receptor (FR), which is expressed on the majority of epithelial ovarian cancers.

The quantity of knee-related macrophages was significantly associated with knee pain severity (R = 0.60, P < 0.0001) and radiographic knee OA severity including joint space narrowing (R = 0.68, P = 0.007), and osteophyte (R = 0.66, P = 0.001).

This approach is useful to preserve the real in vivo morphology of the SCC in living animals avoiding the anatomical shape changes due to the lack of relationships with the surrounding organs in case of extraction. It is also harmless, repeatable and can be applied to explore volumetric changes occurring during body growth, excretory duct obstruction, tumorigenesis and regeneration processes. 3D printing allows to obtain a solid object with the same shape of the organ of interest, which can be observed, freely rotated and manipulated.

Fabrication of viable constructs using a novel multi-head deposition system provides the ability to combine synthetic polymers, which have higher mechanical strength than natural materials, with the favorable environment for cell growth provided by traditional naturally-derived hydrogels. However, the complexity and high cost associated with constructing the required robotic system hamper the widespread application of this approach. Moreover, the scaffolds fabricated by these robotic systems often lack flexibility, which further restrict their applications. To address these limitations, advanced fabrication techniques are necessary to generate complex constructs with controlled architectures and adequate mechanical properties.

Here we identify the related transcription factors Ecm22 and Upc2 as novel regulators of mating. Cells lacking both ECM22 and UPC2 display strong mating defects whereas deletion of either gene has no effect. Ecm22 and Upc2 positively regulate basal expression of PRM1 and PRM4. These genes are strongly induced in response to mating pheromone, which is also largely dependent on ECM22 and UPC2. We further show that deletion of PRM4 like PRM1 results in markedly reduced mating efficiency. Expression of PRM1 but not of PRM4 is also regulated by Ste12, a key transcription factor for mating. STE12 deletion lowers basal PRM1 expression, whereas STE12 overexpression strongly increases PRM1 levels. This regulation of PRM1 transcription is mediated through three Ste12-binding sites in the PRM1 promoter. Simultaneous deletion of ECM22 and UPC2 as well as mutation of the three Ste12-binding sites in the PRM1 promoter completely abolishes basal and pheromone-induced PRM1 expression, indicating that Ste12 and Ecm22/Upc2 control PRM1 transcription through distinct pathways.

ERG11 encodes lanosterol demethylase, the target enzyme of this antifungal class. Overexpression of UPC2 reduces azole susceptibility, whereas its disruption results in hypersusceptibility to azoles and reduced accumulation of exogenous sterols. Overexpression of ERG11 leads to the increased production of lanosterol demethylase, which contributes to azole resistance in clinical isolates of C. albicans, but the mechanism for this has yet to be determined. Using genome-wide gene expression profiling, we found UPC2 and other genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis to be coordinately upregulated with ERG11 in a fluconazole-resistant clinical isolate compared with a matched susceptible isolate from the same patient. Sequence analysis of the UPC2 alleles of these isolates revealed that the resistant isolate contained a single-nucleotide substitution in one UPC2 allele that resulted in a G648D exchange in the encoded protein. Introduction of the mutated allele into a drug-susceptible strain resulted in constitutive upregulation of ERG11 and increased resistance to fluconazole. By comparing the gene expression profiles of the fluconazole-resistant isolate and of strains carrying wild-type and mutated UPC2 alleles, we identified target genes that are controlled by Upc2p.

The proportion of patients with total pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10 for weeks 6-12 was 82.2% in the relugolix group and 83.1% in the leuprorelin group, demonstrating noninferiority of relugolix compared with leuprorelin (relugolix-leuprorelin difference -0.9%; 95% CI: -10.10 to 8.35; prespecified noninferiority margin -15%; P=.001). Reductions in myoma and uterine volumes and increases in hemoglobin levels were comparable in the two groups. Relugolix was associated with an earlier effect on menstrual bleeding than leuprorelin (pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of less than 10, 64.2% vs 31.7% [relugolix-leuprorelin difference 32.5%; 95% CI: 20.95-44.13%] for weeks 2-6 and pictorial blood loss assessment chart score of 0, 52.6% vs 21.8% [30.7%; 95% CI: 19.45-42.00%] for weeks 2-6) and faster recovery of menses after treatment discontinuation (relugolix median [Q1, Q3], 37 days [32.0, 46.0]; leuprorelin median, 65 days [54.0, 77.0]). Adverse events and bone mineral density loss were similar between relugolix and leuprorelin treatment groups. CONCLUSION: In women with uterine leiomyomas, once-daily treatment with relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, demonstrated noninferiority to monthly leuprorelin for improvement of heavy menstrual bleeding at 6-12 weeks of treatment, had a more rapid effect on menstrual bleeding, and was generally well tolerated.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of relugolix to achieve and maintain castration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A phase 2 open-label study was conducted in 103 intermediate-risk PCa patients undergoing primary EBRT and neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT between June 2014 and December 2015. INTERVENTION: Patients randomly assigned (3:2) to 24-wk treatment with either daily oral relugolix or 4-wk subcutaneous depot degarelix (reference control). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The primary endpoint was the rate of effective castration (testosterone <1.73nmol/l) in relugolix patients between 4 and 24 wk of treatment.

RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Castration rates during treatment were 95% and 82% with relugolix and 89% and 68% with degarelix for 1.73 and 0.7nmol/l thresholds, respectively.

The Aho-Corasick algorithm is adapted for execution in field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices in a manner that optimizes space and performance. In this approach, the traditional Aho-Corasick finite state machine (FSM) is split into smaller FSMs, operating in parallel, each of which matches up to 20 peptides in the input translated genome. Each of the smaller FSMs is further divided into five simpler FSMs such that each simple FSM operates on a single bit position in the input (five bits are sufficient for representing all amino acids and special symbols in protein sequences).

Importantly, overexpression of HuR in senescent cells restored a \"younger\" phenotype, while a reduction in HuR expression accentuated the senescent phenotype. HuR associated with the 3' untranslated region of the mRNA encoding the longevity and stress-response protein SIRT1, stabilized the SIRT1 mRNA, and increased SIRT1 expression levels.

The functional importance of PKC alpha in HuR shuttling is highlighted by the high cytosolic HuR content detected in hMC stably overexpressing PKC alpha compared with mock-transfected cells.

Mapping of putative PKC target sites identified serines 158 and 221 as being indispensable for HuR phosphorylation by PKC alpha. RNA pull-down assay and RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the HuR shuttling by ATP is accompanied by an increased HuR binding to cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA.

RESULTS: Changing the methylation status of HuR in HeLa cells by either silencing CARM1 or mutating the major methylation site (R217K) greatly diminished the effect of HuR in regulating the turnover of mRNAs encoding cyclin A, cyclin B1, c-fos, SIRT1, and p16. Although knockdown of CARM1 or HuR individually influenced the expression of cyclin A, cyclin B1, c-fos, SIRT1, and p16, joint knockdown of both CARM1 and HuR did not show further effect. Methylation by CARM1 enhanced the association of HuR with the 3'UTR of p16 mRNA, but not with the 3'UTR of cyclin A, cyclin B1, c-fos, or SIRT1 mRNAs. In senescent human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs), reduced CARM1 was accompanied by reduced HuR methylation.

Its epiblast-induced deletion blocked the morphogenesis of distal bronchial branches at the initiation of the pseudoglandular stage. The phenotype originated from defective mesenchymal responses since the conditional restriction of HuR deletion in epithelial progenitors did not affect distal branching or the completion of lung maturation.

Although in vitro experiments showed indiscriminate binding of Hu proteins synthesized in bacterial systems to many different AU-rich elements (AREs), in vivo studies have pointed to a cytoplasmic role for HuR protein in antagonizing the rapid decay of some specific ARE-containing mRNAs, depending on physiological situations.

Two distinct binding sites were identified within the c-fos ARE, the 5' AUUUA-containing domain and the 3' U-stretch-containing domain. These actions of HuR are markedly different from those of another ARE-binding protein, hnRNP D (also termed AUF1), which in vivo recognizes AUUUA repeats found in cytokine AREs and can exert both stabilizing and destabilizing effects. Further experiments showed that any combination of two of the three RRM domains of HuR is sufficient for strong binding to the c-fos ARE in vitro and to exert an RNA stabilization effect in vivo comparable to that of intact HuR and that the hinge region containing nucleocytoplasmic shuttling signals is dispensable for the stabilization effect of HuR.

As anticipated, AMPK activation also decreased both the cytoplasmic HuR levels and the association of HuR with target radiolabeled transcripts encoding such proliferative genes. HuR function was previously shown to be implicated in the maintenance of a \"young cell\" phenotype in models of replicative cellular senescence. We therefore postulated that AMPK activation in human fibroblasts might contribute to the implementation of the senescence phenotype through mechanisms that included a reduction in HuR cytoplasmic presence. Indeed, AMP:ATP ratios were 2-3-fold higher in senescent fibroblasts compared with young fibroblasts. Accordingly, in vitro senescence was accompanied by a marked elevation in AMPK activity. Evidence that increased AMPK activity directly contributed to the implementation of the senescent phenotype was obtained through two experimental approaches. First, use of AMPK activators triggered senescence characteristics in fibroblasts, such as the acquisition of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) activity and increased p16INK4a expression. Second, infection of cells with an adenoviral vector that expresses active AMPK increased senescence-associated beta-gal activity, whereas infection with an adenovirus that expresses dominant-negative AMPK decreased senescence-associated beta-gal activity.

Our computational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and nucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to other previous studies, our model can predict both in vitro and in vivo nucleosome maps in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase digestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence. By contrast, poly(dA:dT) tracts are seen to deter nucleosome formation, regardless of the experimental method used. We further show that the 10.5 bp nucleotide periodicity facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. Applying our method to in vivo nucleosome maps demonstrates that, for a subset of genes, the regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays observed around transcription start sites can be partially recapitulated by DNA sequence alone.

Although the search for underlying patterns encoded in nucleosomal DNA has been going on for about 30 years, our knowledge of these patterns still remains limited. Based on our evaluations of DNA deformation energy, we developed new scoring functions to predict nucleosome positioning. There are three principal differences between our approach and earlier studies: (i) we assume that the length of nucleosomal DNA varies from 146 to 147 bp; (ii) we consider the anisotropic flexibility of pyrimidine-purine (YR) dimeric steps in the context of their neighbors (e.g., YYRR versus RYRY); (iii) we postulate that alternating AT-rich and GC-rich motifs reflect sequence-dependent interactions between histone arginines and DNA in the minor groove. Using these functions, we analyzed 20 nucleosome positions mapped in vitro at single nucleotide resolution (including clones 601, 603, 605, the pGUB plasmid, chicken beta-globin and three 5S rDNA genes). We predicted 15 of the 20 positions with 1-bp precision, and two positions with 2-bp precision. The predicted position of the '601' nucleosome (i.e., the optimum of the computed score) deviates from the experimentally determined unique position by no more than 1 bp - an accuracy exceeding that of earlier predictions. Our analysis reveals a clear heterogeneity of the nucleosomal sequences which can be divided into two groups based on the positioning 'rules' they follow. The sequences of one group are enriched by highly deformable YR/YYRR motifs at the minor-groove bending sites SHL+/- 3.5 and +/- 5.5, which is similar to the alpha-satellite sequence used in most crystallized nucleosomes. Apparently, the positioning of these nucleosomes is determined by the interactions between histones H2A/H2B and the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA. In the other group (that includes the '601' clone) the same YR/YYRR motifs occur predominantly at the sites SHL +/- 1.5. The interaction between the H3/H4 tetramer and the central part of the nucleosomal DNA is likely to be responsible for the positioning of nucleosomes of this group, and the DNA trajectory in these nucleosomes may differ in detail from the published structures. Thus, from the stereochemical perspective, the in vitro nucleosomes studied here follow either an X-ray-like pattern (with strong deformations in the terminal parts of nucleosomal DNA), or an alternative pattern (with the deformations occurring predominantly in the central part of the nucleosomal DNA).

Besides being involved in packaging DNA, nucleosome organization plays an important role in transcriptional regulation and cellular identity. Currently, there is much debate about the major determinants of the nucleosome architecture of a genome and its significance with little being known about its role in stem cells. To address these questions, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of nucleosomal DNA in two human embryonic stem cell lines and integrated our data with numerous epigenomic maps. Our analyses have revealed that the genome is a determinant of nucleosome organization with transcriptionally inactive regions characterized by a \"ground state\" of nucleosome profiles driven by underlying DNA sequences. DNA sequence preferences are associated with heterogeneous chromatin organization around transcription start sites. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this \"ground state\" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy. As the transcriptional rate increases, nucleosomes become better positioned. Exons transcribed and included in the final spliced mRNA have distinct nucleosome profiles in comparison to exons not included at exon-exon junctions. Genes marked by the active modification H3K4m3 are characterized by lower nucleosome occupancy before the transcription start site compared to genes marked by the inactive modification H3K27m3, while bivalent domains, genes associated with both marks, lie exactly in the middle. Combinatorial patterns of epigenetic marks (chromatin states) are associated with unique nucleosome profiles.

RESULTS: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to maintain adequate nucleosome architecture on a genome scale in yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal DNA tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in nucleosome-depleted DNA tend to inhibit nucleosome formation, which is especially evident at nucleosome-disfavored sequences in nucleosome-free regions at both ends of genes. Sequence polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome positioning correspond to stable nucleosome positioning.

Unexpectedly, some of the mutated desmins, in particular those carrying single amino acid alterations in the non-alpha-helical carboxy-terminal domain (\"tail\"), have been demonstrated to form apparently normal filaments both in vitro and in transfected cells. Thus, it is not clear if filament properties are affected by these mutations at all. For this reason, we performed oscillatory shear experiments with six different desmin \"tail\" mutants in order to characterize the mesh size of filament networks and their strain stiffening properties. Moreover, we have carried out high-frequency oscillatory squeeze flow measurements to determine the bending stiffness of the respective filaments, characterized by the persistence length l(p). Interestingly, mesh size was not altered for the mutant filament networks, except for the mutant DesR454W, which apparently did not form proper filament networks. Also, the values for bending stiffness were in the same range for both the \"tail\" mutants (l(p)=1.0-2.0 microm) and the wild-type desmin (l(p)=1.1+/-0.5 microm). However, most investigated desmin mutants exhibited a distinct reduction in strain stiffening compared to wild-type desmin and promoted nonaffine network deformation. Therefore, we conclude that the mutated amino acids affect intrafilamentous architecture and colloidal interactions along the filament in such a way that the response to applied strain is significantly altered. In order to explore the importance of the \"tail\" domain as such for filament network properties, we employed a \"tail\"-truncated desmin. Under standard conditions, it formed extended regular filaments, but failed to generate strain stiffening.

A standard implementation of this algorithm, when applied to a large sequence of length n , requires more than 20 n  bytes of RAM. Such memory requirements are a significant hurdle to the computation of minimal absent words in large datasets. RESULTS: We present emMAW, the first external-memory algorithm for computing minimal absent words. A free open-source implementation of our algorithm is made available.

Chromatin conformation capture technologies (Hi-C) have revealed that the genome is organized in a hierarchy of topologically associated domains (TADs), sub-TADs, and chromatin loops. Identifying such hierarchical structures is a critical step in understanding genome regulation. Existing tools for TAD calling are frequently sensitive to biases in Hi-C data, depend on tunable parameters, and are computationally inefficient. METHODS: To address these challenges, we developed a novel sliding window-based spectral clustering framework that uses gaps between consecutive eigenvectors for TAD boundary identification. RESULTS: Our method, implemented in an R package, SpectralTAD, detects hierarchical, biologically relevant TADs, has automatic parameter selection, is robust to sequencing depth, resolution, and sparsity of Hi-C data. SpectralTAD outperforms four state-of-the-art TAD callers in simulated and experimental settings. We demonstrate that TAD boundaries shared among multiple levels of the TAD hierarchy were more enriched in classical boundary marks and more conserved across cell lines and tissues. In contrast, boundaries of TADs that cannot be split into sub-TADs showed less enrichment and conservation, suggesting their more dynamic role in genome regulation.

Methods for comparing interacting domains between cells and conditions are highly limited.

TADCompare is based on a spectral clustering-derived measure called the eigenvector gap, which enables a loci-by-loci comparison of boundary differences. Using this measure, we introduce methods for identifying differential and consensus boundaries of interacting domains and tracking boundary changes over time.

To test whether additional polymorphisms contribute to SLE in Japanese, we systematically analyzed the association of TLR7 with SLE in a Japanese female population. METHODS: A case-control association study was conducted on eight tag SNPs in the TLR7 region, including rs3853839, in 344 Japanese females with SLE and 274 healthy female controls. RESULTS: In addition to rs3853839, two SNPs in intron 2, rs179019 and rs179010, which were in moderate linkage disequilibrium with each other (r2 = 0.53), showed an association with SLE (rs179019: P = 0.016, odds ratio (OR) 2.02, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.15 to 3.54; rs179010: P = 0.018, OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.80 (both under the recessive model)). Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that the association of the intronic SNPs and the 3' UTR SNP remained significant after we adjusted them for each other.

The first stage of the study consisted of enrolling 400 Behcet's disease (BD) patients, 400 Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome patients, 400 patients with acute anterior uveitis associated with or without ankylosing spondylitis, and 600 healthy subjects. The second stage included another set of 578 BD patients and 1000 healthy controls. The frequencies of TLR gene copy number types (TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7, TLR9, TLR10) were compared among patients and controls by using the chi(2) test. Real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA expression from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from healthy controls following stimulation with the TLR7 agonist R848. Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IFN-beta in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: All TLRs tested, except for TLR7, had a gene copy number of two in more than 98% of individuals tested. In the first stage, we found a significantly increased frequency of more than one copy of TLR7 (located on the X chromosome) in male BD patients and more than two copies in female patients (correction of P value [PC] = 0.021; PC = 0.048, respectively). A second stage and combined study confirmed the association (PC = 1.14 x 10(-6); PC = 9.12 x 10(-5), respectively). TLR7 mRNA expression in PBMCs was increased in healthy male carriers having more than one copy of TLR7 or females having more than two copies following stimulation with R848 (P = 0.021, P = 0.006, respectively). No effect of the various TLR7 copies on the release of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IFN-beta could be detected.

By genome scanning, evidence of linkage between chromosome Xp22 and asthma and related atopic disorders has previously been obtained. Xp22 harbours the TLR7 and TLR8 genes. METHODS: The involvement of TLR7 and TLR8 in the aetiology of asthma and related disorders was investigated by a family based association analysis of two independently ascertained family samples comprising 540 and 424 individuals from 135 and 100 families, respectively. Ten affected individuals from families showing evidence of linkage to Xp22 were screened for sequence variations in TLR7 and 8, and nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified were tested for association. RESULTS: In both samples, significant associations were observed for single SNPs and haplotypes of both TLR7 and 8 in all four phenotypes investigated: asthma, rhinitis, atopic dermatitis and increased specific IgE. The most significant association was seen for rs2407992 (TLR8) in asthma (p = 0.00023, sample A and B combined, recessive model). In TLR7, rs179008 showed the strongest association. Both rs179008 and rs2407992 are of putative functional significance, potentially affecting TLR7 processing and TLR8 splicing, respectively.

In SLE, the dosage of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) is crucial. Murine models have shown that TLR7 overexpression suffices to induce spontaneous lupus-like disease. Conversely, suppressing TLR7 in lupus-prone mice abolishes SLE development. TLR7 is encoded by a gene on the X chromosome gene, denoted TLR7 in humans and Tlr7 in the mouse, and expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), monocytes/macrophages, and B cells. The receptor recognizes single-stranded RNA, and its engagement promotes B cell maturation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antibodies. In female mammals, each cell randomly inactivates one of its two X chromosomes to equalize gene dosage with XY males. However, 15 to 23% of X-linked human genes escape X chromosome inactivation so that both alleles can be expressed simultaneously. It has been hypothesized that biallelic expression of X-linked genes could occur in female immune cells, hence fostering harmful autoreactive and inflammatory responses. We review here the current knowledge of the role of TLR7 in SLE, and recent evidence demonstrating that TLR7 escapes from X chromosome inactivation in pDCs, monocytes, and B lymphocytes from women and Klinefelter syndrome men.

Recent structural studies of the Robo 1 and Robo 2 ectodomains have provided the basis for a better understanding of their signalling mechanism. These structures reveal how Robo receptors adopt an auto-inhibited conformation on the cell surface that can be further stabilised by cis and/or trans oligmerisation arrays.

METHODS: Pediatric cochlear implant recipients with documented evidence of Waardenburg syndrome underwent retrospective case review. All patients received their cochlear implants at the study institution followed by outpatient auditory habilitation. Charts were reviewed for etiology and duration of deafness, age at time of cochlear implantation, perioperative complications, duration of use, and performance outcomes. Results of standard tests batteries for speech perception and production administered as a part of the patients' auditory habilitation were reviewed. RESULTS: Seven patients with Waardenburg syndrome and cochlear implants were identified. The average age at implantation was 37 months (range, 18-64 months) and the average duration of use was 69 months (range, 12-143 months).

However, Sin1 deficiency results in an increased proportion of Foxp3(+) natural T-regulatory (nTreg) cells in the thymus. The TGF-beta-dependent differentiation of CD4(+) T cells in vitro is enhanced by the inhibition of mTOR but not by loss of Sin1 function.

Men aged 50-69 years from 18 general practices in three cities in the UK completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Short Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey, and the International Continence Society 'male' (ICSmale) questionnaires before giving consent for a PSA test in a community clinic (baseline). Men with an 'abnormal' PSA result returned for further investigation (including biopsy) and repeated these questionnaires before biopsy. RESULTS: At baseline, study participants had similar levels of anxiety and depression to the general male population. There was no increase in the HADS scores, or reduction in the SF-12 mental health component summary score, on attendance at the biopsy clinic after receiving an 'abnormal' PSA result. Urinary symptoms were associated with levels of anxiety and depression before receiving a PSA result (baseline), but were not associated with anxiety and depression at biopsy independently of baseline scores. Therefore changes in anxiety or depression at biopsy did not appear to differ between those with and without urinary symptoms.

We know what decision aids achieve in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but we still know very little about how they are used and how this relates to the informed decision making outcome measures. OBJECTIVE: To examine men's use of an online decision aid for prostate cancer screening using website transaction log files (web-logs), and to examine associations between usage and components of informed decision making. METHODS: We conducted an observational web-log analysis of users of an online decision aid, Prosdex. Men between 50 and 75 years of age were recruited for an associated RCT from 26 general practices across South Wales, United Kingdom. Men allocated to one arm of the RCT were included in the current study. Time and usage data were derived from website log files. Components of informed decision making were measured by an online questionnaire. RESULTS: Available for analysis were 82 web-logs. Overall, there was large variation in the use of Prosdex. The mean total time spent on the site was 20 minutes. The mean number of pages accessed was 32 (SD 21) out of a possible 60 pages. Significant associations were found between increased usage and increased knowledge (Spearman rank correlation [rho] = 0.69, P < .01), between increased usage and less favorable attitude towards PSA testing (rho = -0.52, P < .01), and between increased usage and reduced intention to undergo PSA testing (rho = -0.44, P < .01). A bimodal distribution identified two types of user: low access and high access users. CONCLUSIONS: Increased usage of Prosdex leads to more informed decision making, the key aim of the UK Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: There is no current prostate cancer screening programme in the UK. Evidence suggests that men with LUTS have the same risk of prostate cancer as aged-matched asymptomatic men. However, most men with LUTS are 'screened' with a digital rectal examination (DRE) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing as part of routine assessment. Whether this screening offers any benefit to patients and whether national screening for prostate cancer and subsequent early treatment offer any long-term survival or quality of life benefit is uncertain. Thus 30 men with uncomplicated LUTS were qualitatively interviewed to explore their concerns and worries about their symptoms. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to content analysis using validated techniques. RESULTS: Of the 30 men, 22 (73%) expressed a fear of prostate cancer at the time of their initial presentation.

This study aimed to determine UK GPs' current reported practice regarding PSA testing, and their views towards informed decision-making and PSA testing. METHOD: Online questionnaire survey, with a sample of 421 GPs randomly selected from a database of GPs across the UK. RESULTS: 95% (400/421) of GPs responded. 76% of GPs reported having performed a PSA test for an asymptomatic man at least once in the previous three months, with 13% reported having tested more than five men in this period. A majority of GPs reported they would do a PSA test for men presenting with a family history and requesting a test, for asymptomatic men requesting a test and also for men presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms. Reported testing rates were highest for men with a family history. Amongst men with lower urinary tract symptoms and men with no symptoms, reported testing rates were significantly higher for older than younger men. The majority of GPs expressed support for the current policy (67%), and favoured both the general practitioner and the man being involved in the decision making process (83%). 90% of GPs indicated that they would discuss the benefits and limitation of testing with the man, with most (61%) preferring to ask the man to make a further appointment if he decides to be tested. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that PSA testing in asymptomatic men is a regular occurrence in the UK, and that there is general support from GPs for the current policy of making PSA tests available to 'informed' men who are concerned about prostate cancer. While most GPs indicated they would discuss the benefits and limitations prior to PSA testing, and most GPs favoured a shared approach to decision making, it is not known to what extent men are actually being informed.

Ireland is estimated to have one of the highest prostate cancer incidences in Europe and has no national guidelines for prostate cancer screening. GPs have a pivotal role in influencing PSA testing, therefore, our aim was to describe GP testing practices and to identify factors influencing these. METHODS: A postal survey, including questions on clinical practice and experience, knowledge and demographics was distributed to all GPs (n = 3,683). The main outcomes were (i) PSA testing asymptomatic men and (ii) \"inappropriate\" PSA testing, defined as testing asymptomatic men aged < 50 or > 75 years. Factors associated with these outcomes were identified using logistic regression. RESULTS: 1,625 GPs responded (response rate corrected for eligibility = 53%). Most respondents (79%) would PSA test asymptomatic men. Of these, 34% and 51% would test asymptomatic men < 50 and > 75 years, respectively. In multivariate analyses, GPs were more likely to test asymptomatic men if they were >or= 50 years, in practice >or= 10 years, female or less knowledgeable about PSA efficacy. Male GPs who would have a PSA test themselves were > 8-times more likely to PSA test asymptomatic men than GPs who would not have a test. GPs who had an asymptomatic patient diagnosed with prostate cancer following PSA testing, were > 3-times more likely to test asymptomatic men. Practice-related factors positively associated with testing included: running 'well man' clinics, performing occupational health checks and performing other tests routinely with PSA. Factors positively associated with 'inappropriate' testing included; being male and willing to have a PSA test, having worked/trained in the UK and supporting annual PSA testing. 91% of respondents supported the development of national PSA testing guidelines. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that widespread PSA testing of asymptomatic men in primary care is primarily due to a combination of clinical experience, poor knowledge and the support of doctors for PSA testing, as evidenced by the willingness of male doctors to have a PSA test.

RESULTS: In all, 165 862 PSA tests were performed on 84 669 men, and over a third of men aged > or = 50 years had at least one PSA test. Men aged < 50 years accounted for 12.9% of first tests.

However, low selenium status correlates with risk of goiter and multiple nodules in European women. Some clinical studies have demonstrated that selenium-deficient patients with autoimmune thyroid disease benefit from selenium supplementation, although the data are conflicting and many parameters must still be defined. The baseline selenium status of an individual could constitute the most important parameter modifying the outcome of selenium supplementation, which might primarily disrupt self-amplifying cycles of the endocrine-immune system interface rectifying the interaction of lymphocytes with thyroid autoantigens.

Normal thyroid gland retains high selenium concentrations even under conditions of inadequate selenium supply and expresses many of the known selenocysteine-containing proteins. Adequate selenium nutrition supports efficient thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolism and protects the thyroid gland damage by excessive iodide exposure. In regions where a combined severe iodine and selenium deficiency exist, normalization of iodine supply is mandatory before initiation of selenium supplementation in order to prevent hypothyroidism.

Thyroid is especially sensitive to selenium deficiency, because SeP can modify thyreocytes function by acting as antioxidants and modifying redox status and thyroid hormone metabolism. SeP are also involved in apoptosis, cell growth and modification of the action of cell signalling systems and transcription factors. Some intestinal GPx modulate apoptosis by removing the cells affected by oxidative damage preserving tissue integrity. The malfunctioning of the GPx antioxidant system in intestinal mucosa can trigger a continuous cycle of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Selenium deficiency is a risk factor, due to the malabsorption, in celiac disease (CD) because the inflammatory damage affects the small intestine; this deficiency can modulate SeP genes expression, with consequent reiteration of inflammation and increase of mucosal damage. In active CD, overexpression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) may increase activation of effector mechanisms of epithelial damage by stimulating T helper 1 cytokine proliferation and production and intraepithelial lymphocytes cytotoxicity by protecting these lymphocytes from apoptosis. Blocking IL-15 has the potential to provide new therapeutic tools to prevent both tissue damage and complication of CD such as autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) where IL-15 expression is also increases.

This review focuses on ospemifene including its pharmacologic properties, clinical efficacy and safety. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: The paper provides information on the phamacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of ospemifene. It also contains an overview of its preclinical and clinical efficacy as well as its clinical safety. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: From this paper, the reader will gain an appreciation for a new non-hormonal estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist, ospemifene. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: The pharmacologic properties of ospemifene make it a logical candidate for the treatment of women with moderate to severe symptoms of VVA associated with menopause. Clinical trials have confirmed that daily doses are well-tolerated and that it is effective in normalizing vaginal maturation index and pH as well as improving the symptoms associated with VVA including dyspareunia.", "mesh_terms": ["Atrophy", "Female", "Humans", "Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators", "Tamoxifen", "Vagina", "Vulva"]}, {"pmid": "23777900", "title": "Clinical effects of selective estrogen receptor modulators on vulvar and vaginal atrophy.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Vaginal estrogen therapy at the lowest effective dose is generally recommended for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), but not all women are candidates. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) aim to elicit specific positive effects on targeted tissues with neutral or minimal negative effects on other tissues. This review compares the vaginal effects of currently available and investigational SERMs. METHODS: Relevant English-language articles published between 1980 and 2012 were identified through the PubMed database (search string \"[Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator OR SERM] AND [Vulvar OR Vaginal] AND Atrophy\"), article reference lists, and EMBASE searches for individual SERMs. Both authors reviewed all articles, which formed the basis of this narrative literature review. RESULTS: Activity profiles of SERMs in various tissues are distinct. Tamoxifen and arzoxifene have no specific positive vaginal effects but have reported variable or adverse gynecologic effects. Raloxifene does not improve VVA but can be used safely in combination with vaginal estrogen. Bazedoxifene has no demonstrated efficacy for VVA but, in combination with oral conjugated equine estrogens, improves the signs and symptoms of VVA. SERMs with positive vaginal effects (such as improvement in the vaginal maturation index, reduced vaginal pH, and improvement in the signs and symptoms of VVA) on postmenopausal symptomatic women include lasofoxifene (clinical development on hold) and ospemifene, which was recently approved for the treatment of VVA-related dyspareunia, with a class effect warning of potential venous thrombosis risk.

Ospemifene is the first and only nonestrogen compound approved for this indication. Compared with other approved SERMs, such as tamoxifen, toremifene, bazedoxifene, and raloxifene, the estrogen-like effects of ospemifene in the vaginal epithelium are unique. This review first discusses the rationale for developing ospemifene, including its mechanism of action, and then focuses on the clinical development of ospemifene for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Included are discussions of the effects of ospemifene on the endometrium, serum lipids, coagulation markers, bone, and breast cancer. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.

METHODS: NAMS searched PubMed for medical literature on VVA published since their 2007 position statement on the role of local vaginal estrogen for treatment of vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. A panel of acknowledged experts in the field of genitourinary health reviewed the literature to evaluate new evidence on local estrogen as well as on other management options available or in development for symptomatic VVA. The panel's conclusions and recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. RESULTS: Symptomatic VVA can significantly impair the quality of life (QOL) of postmenopausal women and may be underdiagnosed. In most cases, it can be managed successfully. A number of over-the-counter and government-approved prescription therapies available in the United States and Canada demonstrate effectiveness, depending on the severity of VVA symptoms. These include vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, vaginal estrogen, hormone therapy, and the selective estrogen-receptor modulator ospemifene (indicated for dyspareunia). Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking. Changes in the vaginal microbiome have various effects on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can improve the sexual health and QOL of postmenopausal women by educating women about, diagnosing, and appropriately managing symptomatic VVA. Choice of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms, the effectiveness and safety of therapy for the individual patient, and patient preference. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for moderate to severe symptoms, although a direct comparison of estrogen and ospemifene is not available. Nonhormonal therapies available without a prescription provide sufficient relief for most women with mild symptoms. When low-dose estrogen is administered locally, a progestogen is not indicated for women without a uterus and generally is not indicated for women with an intact uterus. However, endometrial safety has not been studied in clinical trials beyond 1 year.

METHODS: Two open-label, Phase 1 studies were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics of ospemifene in healthy postmenopausal women. In the single-dose study, 60 mg of [3H]-ospemifene was orally administered to 6 subjects. Blood, urine, and fecal samples were collected predose and serially up to 240 hours postdose.

AIM: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug for treating dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. METHODS: A literature review was performed to identify all published randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ospemifene for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia. The search included the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The reference lists of the retrieved studies were also investigated.

Intracellular calcium trafficking, ROS generation, calpain-1 activation and caspase-12 and caspase-9 pathway were studied using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: High-glucose treatment resulted in increased intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) which was mobilized to the mitochondria. Concomitant intra-mitochondrial calcium ([Ca2+]m) increase resulted in enhanced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species generation. These events led to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis.

Troglitazone, an insulin-sensitizing agent, is a promising therapeutic agent for diabetes and has been shown to prevent diabetes-induced myocardial changes. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of troglitazone action on cardiac myocytes, the effects of troglitazone on voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents were examined and compared with classic Ca2+ antagonists (verapamil and nifedipine). METHODS AND RESULTS: Whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques were applied in single guinea pig atrial myocytes. Under control conditions with CsCl internal solution, the voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents consisted of both T-type (ICa,T) and L-type (ICa,L) Ca2+ currents. Troglitazone effectively reduced the amplitude of ICa,L in a concentration-dependent manner. Troglitazone also suppressed ICa,T, but the effect of troglitazone on ICa,T was less potent than that on ICa,L. The current-voltage relationships for ICa,L and the reversal potential for ICa,L were not altered by troglitazone. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of troglitazone on ICa,L measured at a holding potential of -40 mV was 6.3 micromol/L, and 30 micromol/L troglitazone almost completely inhibited ICa,L.

MLST was performed using the Pasteur scheme and the Oxford scheme. Antibiotic resistance genes were identified using ABRicate. RESULTS: XH1056 was resistant to all antibiotics tested, apart from colistin, tigecycline and eravacycline. MLST using the Pasteur scheme assigned XH1056 to ST256.

Our aim was to introduce a novel and efficient clinical sickness score (CSS), and to define a detailed histologic injury score (HIS) in a murine model of C. difficile colitis. Methods: Mice received an antibiotic cocktail (kanamycin, gentamicin, colistin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) for 96 h. After 48 h, mice received an intraperitoneal injection of clindamycin, followed by oral C. difficile (1.5 x 10(7) CFU). Signs of sickness were scored using a novel CSS (range 0-12) with scores >/=6 consistent with C. difficile colitis. Intestinal tissue was analyzed utilizing an adapted HIS (range 0-9) with scores >/=4 consistent with C. difficile colitis. Stool was analyzed for C. difficile, and survival evaluated. Results: No control mice showed signs of sickness, whereas 23% of mice receiving antibiotics alone and 65% of mice exposed to antibiotics and subsequently C. difficile demonstrated signs of sickness (p = 0.0134). No control mice had histologic injury, whereas 8% of mice receiving antibiotics alone and 75% of mice exposed to antibiotics followed by C. difficile had evidence of histologic injury (p = 0.0001). Mice exposed to C. difficile lost more weight, although not significant (p = 0.070). Mice that received C. difficile had decreased survival compared to control mice and mice receiving antibiotics only (p = 0.03). Conclusions: We have developed a novel clinical scoring system, and detailed histological grading system, that enables the objective evaluation of a murine C. difficile colitis model.
