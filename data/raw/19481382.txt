AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgen serum levels significantly decrease in older men, causing 
      quality of life impairment and increasing the risk of chronic disease. This 
      disorder is defined as PADAM (Partial Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men). 
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a PADAM screening tool and determine the prevalence of 
      this disorder in healthy adult men. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in 
      which 96 men aged 40 or more of the South Metropolitan Region of Santiago de 
      Chile were surveyed with the Androgen Deficiency of Aging Men (ADAM) 
      questionnaire of the Saint Louis University and sampled for the serum 
      determination of total testosterone, sexual hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and 
      albumin. Also free and bioavailable testosterone were calculated. PADAM was 
      considered present if items 1 or 7 or any 3 other questions of the ADAM 
      questionnaire were positive. An available testosterone of <198.4 ng/dL was used 
      as a gold standard for the diagnosis of PADAM. RESULTS: A total of 78 men (81.3%) 
      were identified as possible PADAM according to the ADAM questionnaire. Total 
      testosterone levels fell from 503.6+/-180.1 ng/dL in men aged 40 to 54 years to 
      382.1+/-247.3 in those >70 years; however this was not statistically significant 
      (ANOVA, p=0.06). In the same age groups, SHBG significantly increased 
      (31.0+/-15.0 to 47.5+/-15.0 nmol/L, p<0.001) whereas free and available 
      testosterone significantly decreased (10.6+/-3.2 to 6.4+/-3.6 ng/dL and 
      266.6+/-81.2 to 152.2+/-97.6 ng/dL, respectively, p<0.0001). Overall (n=96), 
      available testosterone confirmed PADAM diagnosis in 27 cases (28.1%). The ADAM 
      tool rendered a 83.3% sensitivity and 19.7% specificity in the detection of 
      PADAM. Item 1 (decreased sexual desire) was a better predictor of hypogonadism 
      than the complete questionnaire (63.3% sensitivity and 66.7% specificity). 
      CONCLUSION: In this series, in accordance to available testosterone, the 
      prevalence of PADAM was determined to be high, in which the ADAM questionnaire 
      rendered a low diagnostic efficiency. PADAM diagnosis could be clinically 
      suspected when symptoms of sexual dysfunction are present.
