TI  - Long-term significance of postictal psychotic episodes II. Are they predictive of 
      interictal psychotic episodes?
PG  - 154-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether postictal psychotic 
      episodes (PIPE) are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic 
      episodes (IPE). METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 18 consecutive adults 
      with a partial seizure disorder and PIPE (study group) and 36 patients with a 
      partial seizure disorder but without PIPE (control group). These two groups were 
      compared with respect to the likelihood of developing IPE over an 8-year 
      follow-up period and the variables operant in the development of IPE. Statistical 
      analyses consisted of logistic regression models to identify the variables 
      predictive of the development of IPE. Predictors included: number and location of 
      ictal foci, seizure type, etiology, age at seizure onset, duration of seizure 
      disorder, MRI abnormalities, and psychiatric history prior to the index video/EEG 
      monitoring (other than PIPE). RESULTS: Seven patients with PIPE and one control 
      patient went on to develop an IPE. Predictors of IPE in univariate logistic 
      regression analyses included a history of PIPE (P=0.006), male gender (P=0.028), 
      and having bilateral ictal foci (P=0.048). Significance disappeared for all of 
      these variables when they were entered into a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      A history of PIPE may be a risk factor for the development of IPE. Yet, the 
      disappearance of significance on multivariate analysis indicates that it is not 
      an independent predictor.
