TI  - Are the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor microsatellites related to 
      hypersexuality in children with a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar 
      disorder phenotype?
PG  - 610-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine family-based transmission of the number of 5' flanking 
      arginine vasopressin V1a receptor (AVPR1A) microsatellites, which include 
      [(GATA)(14)] and complex [(CT)(4)-TT-(CT)(8)-(GT)(24)] repeats, in probands with 
      a prepubertal and early adolescent bipolar disorder phenotype (PEA-BP). 
      Preferential transmission of the number of AVPR1A microsatellite repeats to 
      hypersexual and uninhibited people-seeking probands was hypothesized, based on 
      reports from preclinical work in the literature. METHODS: Probands were 83 
      participants in an ongoing controlled study of PEA-BP. The PEA-BP phenotype was 
      defined by DSM-IV mania with at least one of the cardinal symptoms of mania 
      (elation and/or grandiosity) to avoid diagnosing mania only by symptoms that 
      overlapped with those for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). 
      Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University 
      in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia 
      (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about 
      themselves. Hypersexuality and uninhibited people-seeking were assessed from the 
      corresponding WASH-U-KSADS items. Microsatellite genotyping of the AVPR1A repeats 
      was conducted using fluorescently labeled primers and detected by laser-induced 
      fluorescence. Alleles were determined with the assistance of semi-automated 
      allele-calling software. There were 32 complete, biological trios (28 informative 
      families) for the GATA repeat and 34 complete, biological trios (30 informative 
      families) for the complex repeat. Data were analyzed using case-control and 
      family-based association methods. RESULTS: Preferential transmission of AVPR1A 
      GATA or complex repeats was not significant for hypersexuality or uninhibited 
      people-seeking, using the transmission disequilibrium test. Similarly, 
      case-control analyses found no significant associations between hypersexuality or 
      uninhibited people-seeking and the number of AVPR1A GATA or complex repeats. For 
      p < 0.05, there was about 80% power to detect odds ratios of 5.0 and 4.0 (in the 
      family-based analyses) and 3.5 and 2.6 (in the case-control analyses), for allele 
      frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. CONCLUSION: Preferential transmission 
      of AVPR1A to hypersexual or uninhibited people-seeking probands was not 
      supported.
