TI  - Is breast cancer survival improving?
PG  - 44-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite advances in therapies for breast cancer, improvement in 
      survival for patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer has been 
      difficult to establish. The objective of the current study was to determine 
      whether the survival of women with recurrent breast cancer has improved from 1974 
      to 2000. METHODS: The authors analyzed the survival experience of 834 women who 
      developed recurrent breast cancer between November 1974 and December 2000. All 
      patients had been treated previously with adjuvant anthracycline-based protocols. 
      Patients were divided into five consecutive groups based on year of breast cancer 
      recurrence, and survival was compared across the five groups. Because some 
      prognostic variables were divided unevenly divided among the cohorts, a 
      multivariate model was created to determine the association of year of recurrence 
      and survival after accounting for other prognostic factors. RESULTS: In the 
      unadjusted analysis, there was a statistically significant improvement in 
      survival across the five groups, and the more recent cohorts had longer survival 
      (P < 0.001). Other variables that predicted longer survival after breast cancer 
      recurrence included smaller initial tumor size, lower stage of disease, fewer 
      lymph nodes involved, longer disease-free interval, estrogen receptor-positive 
      tumors, and nonvisceral dominant site of disease recurrence. In the multivariate 
      analysis, which adjusted for these prognostic factors, year of recurrence was 
      associated with a trend toward improved survival, with a 1% reduction in risk for 
      each increasing year. CONCLUSIONS: For these cohorts of patients, the authors 
      present data suggesting that the prognosis for patients with recurrent breast 
      cancer improved between 1974 and 2000.
