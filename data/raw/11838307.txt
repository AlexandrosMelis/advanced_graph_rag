AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the amount of tissue removed at loop 
      electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) vs. cold knife conization. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Forty consecutive LEEP or cold knife conization specimens were 
      prospectively measured and weighed by a single pathology technician. Diameter, 
      length and weight of the specimens were compared using Student's t test. RESULTS: 
      Mean diameter of cold knife cone specimens was 2.6 vs. 2.2 cm for LEEP (P = .07). 
      Mean length of cold knife cone specimens was 1.5 vs. 1.0 cm for LEEP (P = .001). 
      Mean weight for cold knife cone specimens was 4.4 vs. 2.0 g for LEEP (P = .001). 
      CONCLUSION: In a prospective evaluation, cold knife cone specimens were 50% 
      longer and 100% heavier than LEEP specimens.
