TI  - Does HER2 immunoreactivity provide prognostic information in locally advanced 
      urothelial carcinoma patients receiving adjuvant M-VEC chemotherapy?
PG  - 210-6
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the impact of HER2 immunoreactivity on clinical outcome 
      in locally advanced urothelial carcinoma patients who received surgery alone, or 
      methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, and cisplatin (M-VEC) as adjuvant 
      chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 114 formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded specimens obtained from locally advanced urothelial carcinoma 
      patients receiving surgery alone or adjuvant M-VEC. The authors evaluated HER2 
      immunoreactivity using immunohistochemical staining and explored the influence of 
      pathological parameters and HER2 immunoreactivity on progression-free survival 
      (PFS) and disease-specific overall survival (OS) using univariate and 
      multivariate Cox's analyses. RESULTS: Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder had a 
      significantly higher frequency of HER2 immunoreactivity than that of the upper 
      urinary tract (60.7 vs. 20.7%, p < 0.0001). Overall, nodal status was a strong 
      and independent prognostic indicator for clinical outcome. The HER2 
      immunoreactivity was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.02) and 
      disease-specific OS (p = 0.005) in advanced urothelial carcinoma patients. As for 
      patients with adjuvant M-VEC, HER2 immunoreactivity was a significant prognostic 
      factor for PFS (p = 0.03) and disease-specific OS (p = 0.02) using univariate 
      analysis, but not multivariate analysis, and not for patients receiving watchful 
      waiting. CONCLUSIONS: HER2 immunoreactivity might have a limited prognostic value 
      for advanced urothelial carcinoma patients with adjuvant M-VEC.
