TI  - Are opioid dependence and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) documented in the 
      medical record? A patient safety issue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid-dependent patients often have co-occurring chronic illnesses 
      requiring medications that interact with methadone. Methadone maintenance 
      treatment (MMT) is typically provided separately from medical care. Hence, 
      coordination of medical care and substance use treatment is important to preserve 
      patient safety. OBJECTIVE: To identify potential safety risks among MMT patients 
      engaged in medical care by evaluating the frequency that opioid dependence and 
      MMT documentation are missing in medical records and characterizing potential 
      medication-methadone interactions. METHODS: Among patients from a methadone 
      clinic who received primary care from an affiliated, but separate, medical 
      center, we reviewed electronic medical records for documentation of methadone, 
      opioid dependence, and potential drug-methadone interactions. The proportions of 
      medical records without opioid dependence and methadone documentation were 
      estimated and potential medication-methadone interactions were identified. 
      RESULTS: Among the study subjects (n = 84), opioid dependence documentation was 
      missing from the medical record in 30% (95% CI, 20%-41%) and MMT documentation 
      was missing from either the last primary care note or the last hospital discharge 
      summary in 11% (95% CI, 5%-19%). Sixty-nine percent of the study subjects had at 
      least 1 medication that potentially interacted with methadone; 19% had 3 or more 
      potentially interacting medications. CONCLUSION: Among patients receiving MMT and 
      medical care at different sites, documentation of opioid dependence and MMT in 
      the medical record occurs for the majority, but is missing in a substantial 
      number of patients. Most of these patients are prescribed medications that 
      potentially interact with methadone. This study highlights opportunities for 
      improved coordination between medical care and MMT.
