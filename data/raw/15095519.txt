TI  - Are patients with diabetes receiving the same message from dietitians and nurses?
PG  - 293-300
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if registered dietitian (RD) 
      and registered nurse (RN) certified diabetes educators (CDEs) provide similar 
      recommendations regarding carbohydrates and dietary supplements to individuals 
      with diabetes. METHODS: A survey was mailed to CDEs in the southern United 
      States. Participants were asked to indicate their recommendations for use of 
      carbohydrates, fiber, artificial sweeteners, and 12 selected dietary and herbal 
      supplements when counseling individuals with diabetes. RESULTS: The survey sample 
      consisted of 366 CDEs: 207 were RNs and 159 were RDs. No statistically 
      significant differences were found between RNs and RDs in typical carbohydrate 
      recommendations for treatment of diabetes. However, RDs were more likely than RNs 
      to make recommendations for fiber intake or use of the glycemic index. A 
      significant difference also was found in the treatment of hypoglycemia: RNs were 
      more likely than RDs to recommend consuming a carbohydrate source with protein to 
      treat hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Although some differences existed, RD and RN 
      CDEs are making similar overall recommendations in the treatment of individuals 
      with diabetes.
