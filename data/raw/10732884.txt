TI  - Does coronary angiography before emergency aortic surgery affect in-hospital 
      mortality?
PG  - 889-94
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the relationship between coronary angiography and 
      in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing emergency surgery of the aorta 
      without a history of coronary revascularization or coronary angiography before 
      the onset of symptoms. BACKGROUND: In the setting of acute ascending aortic 
      dissection warranting emergency aortic repair, coronary angiography has been 
      considered to be desirable, if not essential. The benefits of defining coronary 
      anatomy have to be weighed against the risks of additional delay before surgical 
      intervention. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patient charts and the 
      Cardiovascular Information Registry (CVIR) at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. 
      RESULTS: We studied 122 patients who underwent emergency surgery of the aorta 
      between January 1982 and December 1997. Overall, in-hospital mortality was 18.0%, 
      and there was no significant difference between those who had coronary 
      angiography on the day of surgery compared with those who had not (No: 16%, n = 
      81 vs. Yes: 22%, n = 41, p = 0.46). Multivariate analysis revealed that a history 
      of myocardial infarction (MI) was the only predictor of in-hospital mortality 
      (relative risk: 4.98 95% confidence interval: 1.48-16.75, p = 0.009); however, 
      coronary angiography had no impact on in-hospital mortality in patients with a 
      history of MI. Furthermore, coronary angiography did not significantly affect the 
      incidence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) during aortic surgery (17% 
      vs. 25%, Yes vs. No). Operative reports revealed that 74% of all CABG procedures 
      were performed because of coronary dissection, and not coronary artery disease. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that determination of coronary anatomy may not 
      impact on survival in patients undergoing emergency surgery of the aorta and 
      support the concept that once diagnosed, patients should proceed as quickly as 
      possible to surgery.
