      edaravone offer protection?

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate whether prophylactic treatment with 
      edaravone prevents ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced ovarian damage during 
      pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model. METHODS: Twenty-eight female 
      Sprague Dawley rats were allocated randomly to 4 groups. The sham group (group 1) 
      was only subjected to catheter insertion, not to pneumoperitoneum. Group 2 
      received a 1 mg/kg dose of 0.9% sodium chloride by the intraperitoneal route for 
      10 min before pneumoperitoneum. Groups 3 and 4 received 6 and 12 mg/kg edaravone, 
      respectively, by the intraperitoneal route for 10 min before pneumoperitoneum. 
      After 60 min of pneumoperitoneum, the gas was deflated. Immediately after the 
      reperfusion period, both ovaries were excised for histological scoring, caspase-3 
      immunohistochemistry and biochemical evaluation including glutathione (GSH) and 
      malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured 
      in plasma samples to evaluate the antioxidant effect of edaravone. RESULTS: 
      Ovarian sections in the saline group revealed higher scores for follicular 
      degeneration and edema (p < 0.0001) when compared with the sham group. 
      Administration of different doses of edaravone in rats significantly prevented 
      degenerative changes in the ovary (p < 0.0001). Caspase-3 expression was only 
      detected in the ovarian surface epithelium in all groups, and there was a 
      significant difference between the treatment groups and the saline group (p < 
      0.0001). Treatment of rats with edaravone reduced caspase-3 expression in a 
      dose-dependent manner. Moreover, biochemical measurements of oxidative stress 
      markers (MDA, GSH and TAC) revealed that prophylactic edaravone treatment 
      attenuated oxidative stress induced by I/R injury. CONCLUSION: These results 
      indicate that prophylactic treatment with edaravone prevents I/R-induced ovarian 
      damage during pneumoperitoneum in an experimental rat model.
