      cumulative opioid doses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimal access surgery (MAS) in adults is associated with less 
      postoperative pain in comparison to conventional 'open' surgery. It is not known 
      whether this holds true for neonates as well. Less pain would imply that opioid 
      consumption can be reduced, which has a beneficial effect on morbidity. AIM: To 
      evaluate potential differences in' opioid consumption between neonates undergoing 
      thoracoscopic minimal access surgery or conventional surgery of esophageal 
      atresia (EA) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). METHODS: In this 
      retrospective cohort study we included two controls for each MAS patient, matched 
      on diagnosis, sex and age at surgery. Opioid dose titration was based on 
      validated pain scores (VAS and COMFORT behaviour), applied by protocol. 
      Cumulative opioid doses at 12, 24, 48 h and 7 days postoperatively were compared 
      between groups with the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 
      24 MAS patients (14 EA; 10 CDH). These were matched to 48 control patients (28 
      EA; 20 CDH). At none of the time points cumulative opioid (median in mg/kg (IQR)) 
      doses significantly differed between MAS patients and controls, both with CDH and 
      EA. For example at 24 h postoperative for CDH patients cumulative opioid doses 
      were [0.84(0.61-1.83) MAS vs. 1.06(0.60-1.36) p=1.0] controls, For EA patients at 
      24 h the cumulative opioid doses were [0.48(0.30-0.75) MAS vs. 0.49(0.35-0.79) 
      p=0.83] controls. This held true for the postoperative pain scores as well. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Minimal access surgery for the repair of esophageal atresia or 
      congenital diaphragmatic hernia is not associated with less cumulative opioid 
      doses.
