      data?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although record linkage of routinely collected health datasets is a 
      valuable research resource, most datasets are established for administrative 
      purposes and not for health outcomes research. In order for meaningful results to 
      be extrapolated to specific populations, the limitations of the data and linkage 
      methodology need to be investigated and clarified. It is the objective of this 
      study to investigate the differences in ascertainment which may arise between a 
      hospital admission dataset and a dispensing claims dataset, using major 
      depression in pregnancy as an example. The safe use of antidepressants in 
      pregnancy is an ongoing issue for clinicians with around 10% of pregnant women 
      suffer from depression. As the birth admission will be the first admission to 
      hospital during their pregnancy for most women, their use of antidepressants, or 
      their depressive condition, may not be revealed to the attending hospital 
      clinicians. This may result in adverse outcomes for the mother and infant. 
      METHODS: Population-based de-identified data were provided from the Western 
      Australian Data Linkage System linking the administrative health records of women 
      with a delivery to related records from the Midwives' Notification System, the 
      Hospital Morbidity Data System and the national Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 
      dataset. The women with depression during their pregnancy were ascertained in two 
      ways: women with dispensing records relating to dispensed antidepressant 
      medicines with an WHO ATC code to the 3rd level, pharmacological subgroup, 'N06A 
      Antidepressants'; and, women with any hospital admission during pregnancy, 
      including the birth admission, if a comorbidity was recorded relating to 
      depression. RESULTS: From 2002 to 2005, there were 96698 births in WA. At least 
      one antidepressant was dispensed to 4485 (4.6%) pregnant women. There were 3010 
      (3.1%) women with a comorbidity related to depression recorded on their delivery 
      admission, or other admission to hospital during pregnancy. There were a total of 
      7495 pregnancies identified by either set of records. Using data linkage, we 
      determined that these records represented 6596 individual pregnancies. Only 899 
      pregnancies were found in both groups (13.6% of all cases). 80% of women 
      dispensed an antidepressant did not have depression recorded as a comorbidity on 
      their hospital records. A simple capture-recapture calculation suggests the 
      prevalence of depression in this population of pregnant women to be around 16%. 
      CONCLUSION: No single data source is likely to provide a complete health profile 
      for an individual. For women with depression in pregnancy and dispensed 
      antidepressants, the hospital admission data do not adequately capture all cases.
