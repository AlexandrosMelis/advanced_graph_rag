AB  - BACKGROUND: Some pediatric patients, typically those that are very young or felt 
      to be especially sick are temporarily admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
      for observation during their first transfusion. If a significant reaction that 
      requires ICU management does not occur, these patients are then transferred to a 
      regular ward where future blood products are administered. The aim of this 
      project was to determine if heightened observation such as temporary ICU 
      admissions for the first transfusion are warranted. METHODS: From the blood bank 
      records of a tertiary care pediatric hospital, a list of patients on whom a 
      transfusion reaction was reported between 2007 and 2012, the type of reaction and 
      the patient's transfusion history, were extracted. The hospital location where 
      the transfusion occurred, and whether the patient was evaluated by the ICU team 
      or transferred to the ICU for management of the reaction was determined from the 
      patient's electronic medical record. RESULTS: There were 174 acute reactions in 
      150 patients. Of these 150 patients, 13 (8.7%) different patients experienced a 
      reaction during their first transfusion; all 13 patients experienced clinically 
      mild reactions (8 febrile non-hemolytic, 4 mild allergic, and 1 patient who 
      simultaneously had a mild allergic and a febrile non-hemolytic), and none 
      required ICU management. Six severe reactions (6 of 174, 3.4%) involving 
      significant hypotension and/or hypoxia that required acute and intensive 
      management occurred during subsequent (i.e. not the first) transfusion in six 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: The practice of intensive observation for the first 
      transfusion in pediatric patients is probably unnecessary.
