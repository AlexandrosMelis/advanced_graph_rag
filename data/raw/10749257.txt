TI  - Has the mammography quality standards act affected the mammography quality in 
      North Carolina?
PG  - 1089-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The United States Food and Drug Administration implemented federal 
      regulations governing mammography under the Mammography Quality Standards Act 
      (MQSA) of 1992. During 1995, its first year in implementation, we examined the 
      impact of the MQSA on the quality of mammography in North Carolina. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: All mammography facilities were inspected during 1993-1994, and again in 
      1995. Both inspections evaluated mean glandular radiation dose, phantom image 
      evaluation, darkroom fog, and developer temperature. Two mammography health 
      specialists employed by the North Carolina Division of Radiation Protection 
      performed all inspections and collected and codified data. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of facilities that met quality standards increased from the first 
      inspection to the second inspection. Phantom scores passing rate was 31.6% versus 
      78.2%; darkroom fog passing rate was 74.3% versus 88.5%; and temperature 
      difference passing rate was 62.4% versus 86.9%. CONCLUSION: In 1995, the first 
      year that the MQSA was in effect, there was a significant improvement in the 
      quality of mammography in North Carolina. This improvement probably resulted from 
      facilities' compliance with federal regulations.
