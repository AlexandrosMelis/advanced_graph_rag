TI  - Does maternal obesity have an influence on feeding behavior of obese children?
PG  - 481-7
AB  - AIM: Although the pathogenesis of childhood obesity is multi factorial, maternal 
      obesity and parenting have major roles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      influence of maternal obesity on feeding practices toward their obese school 
      children. METHODS: Obese children and adolescents referred to the pediatric 
      endocrinology department were enrolled consecutively. Height and weight of all 
      children and their mothers were measured. Maternal feeding practices were 
      measured using an adapted version of the Child Feeding Questionnaire (CFQ). 
      Answers were compared between obese (Body Mass Index [BMI] >/= 30 kg/m2) and 
      non-obese mothers. RESULTS: A total of 491 obese subjects (292 girls, mean age 
      12.0 +/- 2.8 years) and their mothers participated in this study. A direct 
      correlation between children's BMI and their mothers' BMI was found (P<0.001) 
      both in girls (r = 0.372) and boys (r = 0.337). While 64.4% of mothers were found 
      obese in the study, only half of them consider themselves as obese. No difference 
      were found in the scores of the subscales "perceived responsibility", 
      "restriction", "concern for child's weight" and "monitoring" between obese and 
      non-obese mothers. Child's BMI-SDS positively correlated with mothers' personal 
      weight perception, concern for child's weight and restriction after adjustment 
      for child's age (P < 0.001, P = 0.012 and P = 0.002, respectively). CONCLUSION: 
      Mothers' BMI highly correlate with children's BMI-z-scores. The degree of child's 
      obesity increases mothers' concern and food restriction behavior. While mothers 
      of obese children have a high prevalence of obesity, maternal obesity was found 
      to have no significant influence on feeding behavior of obese school children.
