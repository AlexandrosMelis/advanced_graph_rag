      parities?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the glomerular hyperfiltration due to 
      pregnancy in women with more parities. METHODS: Five hundred women aged 52.57 +/- 
      8.08 years, without a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or complicated 
      pregnancy were involved in the study. They were divided into three groups. Group 
      1: women with no or one parity (n = 76); group 2: women with two or three 
      parities (n = 333); group 3: women with four or more parities (n = 91). 
      Laboratory parameters and demographical data were compared between the three 
      groups. RESULTS: Mean age, serum urea and serum creatinine were similar between 
      three groups. Patients in group 3 had significantly higher GFR values compared to 
      groups 1 and 2 (109.44 +/- 30.99, 110.76 +/- 30.22 and 121.92 +/- 34.73 
      mL/min/1.73 m(2) for groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively; P = 0.008 for group 1 vs 
      group 3; P = 0.002 for group 2 vs group 3). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we suggest 
      that glomerular hyperfiltration due to pregnancy does not have adverse effects on 
      kidney in women with more parities. Pregnancy may have possible protective 
      mechanisms for kidney against adverse effects of glomerular hyperfiltration.
