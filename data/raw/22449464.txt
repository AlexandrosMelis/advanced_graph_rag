TI  - Do general practice selection scores predict success at MRCGP? An exploratory 
      study.
PG  - 95-100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selection into general practice training is undertaken using a 
      competency based approach. The clear advantage of this approach over traditional 
      methods has been demonstrated through evaluation of its validity and reliability. 
      However, the relationship between selection and performance in the Royal College 
      of General Practitioner examinations (MRCGP) has yet to be explored. The MRCGP 
      comprises of an applied knowledge test (AKT), a clinical skills assessment (CSA) 
      and workplace-based assessments (WPBA). AIM: To explore the predictive validity 
      of general practice selection scores using the AKT and CSA elements of the MRCGP 
      as a final outcome measure. METHODS: This study carried out a retrospective 
      analysis of 101 trainees from the Wales Deanery who were successfully selected on 
      to general practice training in 2007. Selection data consisted of an overall 
      selection score as well as scores from each individual stage of selection. 
      Correlation was used to explore associations between selection scores and 
      examination scores. RESULTS: The score for overall performance at selection 
      achieved statistically significant correlation with examination performance (r = 
      0.491 for the AKT and r = 0.526 for the CSA, P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The general 
      practice selection process is predictive of future performance in the MRCGP.
