TI  - Inhibin: a new circulating marker of hydatidiform mole?
PG  - 1684-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the concentrations of inhibin in serum and tissue of 
      patients with hydatidiform mole and assess their value as a clinical marker of 
      the condition. DESIGN: Prospective study of new patients with hydatidiform mole, 
      comparison of paired observations, and case-control analysis. SETTING: A 
      university hospital, two large public hospitals, and a private women's clinic in 
      Japan. PATIENTS: Seven consecutive referred patients seen over four months with 
      newly diagnosed complete hydatidiform mole, including one in whom the mole was 
      accompanied by viable twin fetuses (case excluded from statistical analysis 
      because of unique clinical features). All patients followed up for six months 
      after evacuation of molar tissue. END POINT: Correlation of serum inhibin 
      concentrations with trophoblastic disease. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum 
      concentrations of inhibin, human chorionic gonadotrophin, and follicle 
      stimulating hormone were compared before and seven to 10 days after evacuation of 
      the mole. Before evacuation the serum inhibin concentrations (median 8.3 U/ml; 
      95% confidence interval 2.4 to 34.5) were significantly greater than in 21 normal 
      women at the same stage of pregnancy (2.8 U/ml; 2.1 to 3.6), and inhibin in molar 
      tissue was also present in high concentrations (578 U/ml cytosol; 158 to 1162). 
      Seven to 10 days after evacuation inhibin concentrations in serum samples from 
      the same patients declined significantly to values (0.4 U/ml; 0.1 to 1.4) similar 
      to those seen in the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles. None of the 
      four patients whose serum inhibin concentrations were 0.4 U/ml or less after 
      evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. Though serum human 
      chorionic gonadotrophin concentrations declined after evacuation (6.6 x 10(3) 
      IU/l; 0.8 x 10(3) to 32.6 x 10(3], they remained far higher than in non-pregnant 
      women. Serum follicle stimulating hormone concentrations remained suppressed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this small study serum inhibin concentrations higher than those 
      found in the early follicular phase one to two weeks after evacuation of a 
      hydatidiform mole seemed to be specific for persistent trophoblastic disease. 
      Further data are needed to confirm these promising results.
