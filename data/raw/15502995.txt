TI  - Does the early adopter of drugs exist? A population-based study of general 
      practitioners' prescribing of new drugs.
PG  - 667-72
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse associations between indicators for adoption of new drugs 
      and to test the hypothesis that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a 
      personal trait independent of drug groups. METHODS: In a population-based cohort 
      study using register data, we analysed the prescribing of new drugs by Danish 
      general practitioners. Angiotensin-II antagonists, triptans, selective 
      cyclo-oxygenase-2 antagonists and esomeprazol were used in the assessment. As 
      indicators of new drug uptake, we used adoption time, cumulative incidence, 
      preference proportion, incidence rate and prescription cost and volume. For each 
      measure, we ranked the general practices. Ranks were pair-wise plotted, and 
      Pearson's correlation coefficient ( r) was calculated. Next, we analysed the 
      correlation between ranks across different drug classes. RESULTS: For all 
      indicators, the general practitioners' adoption of one group of drugs was poorly 
      associated with adoption of others ( r</=0.49), indicating that early adoption of 
      one type of drugs is not associated with early adoption of another. For all drug 
      groups, adoption time adjusted for practice size was only weakly associated with 
      other indicators ( r: -0.56 to -0.27). Indicators, based on cost and volume of 
      drugs, were highly correlated ( r: 0.96-0.99), and the others correlated 
      reasonably well ( r: 0.51-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Within drug groups, indicators of 
      drug adoption, except for adoption time, correlate reasonably well. However, the 
      theory that physicians' early adoption of new drugs is a personal trait 
      independent of the type of drug could not be confirmed. The notion of the 
      early-drug-adopting general practitioner may be mistaken.
