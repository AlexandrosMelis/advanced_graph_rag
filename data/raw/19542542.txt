TI  - Is there a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the 
      implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle?

AB  - BACKGROUND: To understand which genes are really involved in the implantation 
      process, we planned to study the gene basal expression profile during the window 
      of implantation (WOI) of patients who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle. 
      METHODS: Women attending their first ICSI cycle at ANDROS Day Surgery for severe 
      male factor infertility were included in the study. An endometrial biopsy was 
      performed during the WOI, in one of the last two cycles before the ICSI cycle. 
      Forty-seven selected gene profiles were analyzed using Low Density Array 
      technology. Only biopsies from women who subsequently became pregnant were 
      evaluated, to exclude any bias regarding embryo viability and embryo transfer 
      difficulties. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included in the analysis as they 
      became pregnant after ICSI procedure. Four of 47 selected genes were excluded 
      from the analysis. Of the 43 genes analyzed, only 6 genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, 
      LIF, NNMT and STC1) showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who 
      subsequently became pregnant. For all the other genes analyzed there were 
      considerable differences in their expression levels amongst women who 
      subsequently became pregnant. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that very few genes, 
      which change their expression level during the WOI, show a quantitative 
      homogeneous expression in endometrially-receptive patients. In conclusion, in 
      this study only six genes showed a homogeneous expression, and are probably 
      involved in embryo implantation mechanisms.
