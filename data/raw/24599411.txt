      location on prognosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the characteristics and prognoses of gastric cancers by tumor 
      location in Korean and U.S. subjects after curative-intent (R0) resection for 
      gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: Data were collected for all patients who had 
      undergone R0 resection at one U.S. institution (n = 567) and one South Korean 
      institution (n = 1,620). Patients with gastroesophageal junction tumors or 
      neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Patient, surgical, and pathologic variables 
      were compared by tumor location. Factors associated with disease-specific 
      survival (DSS) were determined via multivariate analysis. RESULTS: In the Korean 
      cohort, significantly more upper third GC (UTG) patients had undifferentiated, 
      diffuse type, and advanced stage cancers compared to lower third GC (LTG) and 
      middle third GC (MTG) patients. In the U.S. cohort, however, T stage was 
      relatively evenly distributed among UTG, MTG, and LTG patients. The independent 
      predictors of DSS in the Korean cohort were T stage, tumor size, retrieved and 
      positive lymph node counts, and age, but in the U.S. cohort, the only independent 
      predictors were T stage and positive lymph node count. Tumor size significantly 
      affected DSS of Korean UTG patients but not U.S. UTG patients. CONCLUSIONS: There 
      were significant differences in tumor characteristics by tumor location within 
      and between both national cohorts. On the basis of these findings, further study 
      to investigate the biological difference between the two countries is needed.
