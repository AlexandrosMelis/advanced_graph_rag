TI  - Stretch-sensitive KCNQ1 mutation A link between genetic and environmental factors 
      in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation?
PG  - 578-86
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate mutations in genes encoding the slow 
      component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K+ current (I(Ks)) channel in familial 
      atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: Although AF can have a genetic etiology, 
      links between inherited gene defects and acquired factors such as atrial stretch 
      have not been explored. METHODS: Mutation screening of the KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNE2, 
      and KCNE3 genes was performed in 50 families with AF. The effects of mutant 
      protein on cardiac I(Ks) activation were evaluated using electrophysiological 
      studies and human atrial action potential modeling. RESULTS: One missense KCNQ1 
      mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of 
      hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had 
      developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of 
      wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically 
      significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at 
      baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure 
      to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling/stretch, mutant channels showed a 
      marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of 
      activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action 
      potential duration. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the R14C KCNQ1 mutation 
      alone is insufficient to cause AF. Rather, we suggest a model in which a "second 
      hit", such as an environmental factor like hypertension, which promotes atrial 
      stretch and thereby unmasks an inherited defect in ion channel kinetics (the 
      "first hit"), is required for AF to be manifested. Such a model would also 
      account for the age-related increase in AF development.
