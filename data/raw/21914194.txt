      experts about principles of good practice? A Delphi study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: European Member States are facing a challenge to provide accessible 
      and effective health care services for immigrants. It remains unclear how best to 
      achieve this and what characterises good practice in increasingly multicultural 
      societies across Europe. This study assessed the views and values of 
      professionals working in different health care contexts and in different European 
      countries as to what constitutes good practice in health care for immigrants. 
      METHODS: A total of 134 experts in 16 EU Member States participated in a 
      three-round Delphi process. The experts represented four different fields: 
      academia, Non-Governmental Organisations, policy-making and health care practice. 
      For each country, the process aimed to produce a national consensus list of the 
      most important factors characterising good practice in health care for migrants. 
      RESULTS: The scoring procedures resulted in 10 to 16 factors being identified as 
      the most important for each participating country. All 186 factors were 
      aggregated into 9 themes: (1) easy and equal access to health care, (2) 
      empowerment of migrants, (3) culturally sensitive health care services, (4) 
      quality of care, (5) patient/health care provider communication, (6) respect 
      towards migrants, (7) networking in and outside health services, (8) targeted 
      outreach activities, and (9) availability of data about specificities in migrant 
      health care and prevention. Although local political debate, level of immigration 
      and the nature of local health care systems influenced the selection and rating 
      of factors within each country, there was a broad European consensus on most 
      factors. Yet, discordance remained both within countries, e.g. on the need for 
      prioritising cultural differences, and between countries, e.g. on the need for 
      more consistent governance of health care services for immigrants. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Experts across Europe asserted the right to culturally sensitive health care for 
      all immigrants. There is a broad consensus among experts about the major 
      principles of good practice that need to be implemented across Europe. However, 
      there also is some disagreement both within and between countries on specific 
      issues that require further research and debate.
