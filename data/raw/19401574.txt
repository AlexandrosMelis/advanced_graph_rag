AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of gadofosveset-enhanced magnetic 
      resonance (MR) angiography in the assessment of carotid artery stenosis, with 
      digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the reference standard, and to determine 
      the value of reading first-pass, steady-state, and "combined" (first-pass plus 
      steady-state) MR angiograms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by 
      the local ethics committee, and all subjects gave written informed consent. MR 
      angiography and DSA were performed in 84 patients (56 men, 28 women; age range, 
      61-76 years) with carotid artery stenosis at Doppler ultrasonography. Three 
      readers reviewed the first-pass, steady-state, and combined MR data sets, and one 
      independent observer evaluated the DSA images to assess stenosis degree, plaque 
      morphology and ulceration, stenosis length, and tandem lesions. Interobserver 
      agreement regarding MR angiographic findings was analyzed by using intraclass 
      correlation and Cohen kappa coefficients. Sensitivity, specificity, positive 
      predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated by 
      using the McNemar test to determine possible significant differences (P < .05). 
      RESULTS: Interobserver agreement regarding all MR angiogram readings was 
      substantial. For grading stenosis, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were, 
      respectively, 90%, 92%, 91%, and 91% for first-pass imaging; 95% each for 
      steady-state imaging; and 96%, 99%, 99%, and 97% for combined imaging. For 
      evaluation of plaque morphology, respective values were 84%, 86%, 88%, and 82% 
      for first-pass imaging; 98%, 97%, 98%, and 97% for steady-state imaging; and 98%, 
      100%, 100%, and 97% for combined imaging. Differences between the first-pass, 
      steady-state, and combined image readings for assessment of stenosis degree and 
      plaque morphology were significant (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Gadofosveset-enhanced 
      MR angiography is a promising technique for imaging carotid artery stenosis. 
      Steady-state image reading is superior to first-pass image reading, but the 
      combined reading protocol is more accurate.
