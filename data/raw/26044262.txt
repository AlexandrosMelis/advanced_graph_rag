AB  - BACKGROUND: Rates of active travel vary by socio-economic position, with higher 
      rates generally observed among less affluent populations. Aspects of both social 
      and built environments have been shown to affect active travel, but little 
      research has explored the influence of physical environmental characteristics, 
      and less has examined whether physical environment affects socio-economic 
      inequality in active travel. This study explored income-related differences in 
      active travel in relation to multiple physical environmental characteristics 
      including air pollution, climate and levels of green space, in urban areas across 
      England. We hypothesised that any gradient in the relationship between income and 
      active travel would be least pronounced in the least physically 
      environmentally-deprived areas where higher income populations may be more likely 
      to choose active transport as a means of travel. METHODS: Adults aged 16+ living 
      in urban areas (n = 20,146) were selected from the 2002 and 2003 waves of the UK 
      National Travel Survey. The mode of all short non-recreational trips undertaken 
      by the sample was identified (n = 205,673). Three-level binary logistic 
      regression models were used to explore how associations between the trip being 
      active (by bike/walking) and three income groups, varied by level of multiple 
      physical environmental deprivation. RESULTS: Likelihood of making an active trip 
      among the lowest income group appeared unaffected by physical environmental 
      deprivation; 15.4% of their non-recreational trips were active in both the least 
      and most environmentally-deprived areas. The income-related gradient in making 
      active trips remained steep in the least environmentally-deprived areas because 
      those in the highest income groups were markedly less likely to choose active 
      travel when physical environment was 'good', compared to those on the lowest 
      incomes (OR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: The socio-economic 
      gradient in active travel seems independent of physical environmental 
      characteristics. Whilst more affluent populations enjoy advantages on some health 
      outcomes, they will still benefit from increasing their levels of physical 
      activity through active travel. Benefits of active travel to the whole community 
      would include reduced vehicle emissions, reduced carbon consumption, the 
      preservation or enhancement of infrastructure and the presentation of a 
      'normalised' behaviour.
