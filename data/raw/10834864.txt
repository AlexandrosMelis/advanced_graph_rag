TI  - Risk factors for avascular necrosis of bone in patients with systemic lupus 
      erythematosus: is there a role for antiphospholipid antibodies?
PG  - 462-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) is a well known complication in 
      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      role of antiphospholipid antibody status (IgM and IgG anticardiolipin antibodies 
      and lupus anticoagulant) with adjustment for corticosteroid use as risk factors 
      for the development of AVN. METHODS: A cohort of 265 patients receiving long term 
      follow up in our SLE clinic from 1978 to 1998 was analysed. Patients with AVN 
      complications were detected and then matched for age, sex, ethnicity, duration of 
      disease, and organ disease with two other patients with SLE. A further 31 
      patients were chosen at random for the analysis. RESULTS: Eleven patients had 
      AVN, giving a point prevalence of 4%. There were no significant differences 
      demonstrable in the presence of individual antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) or 
      their combination between the group with AVN or the two control groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Incorporating an adjustment for corticosteroid use we were unable to 
      show a link between the presence of aPL and the development of AVN in patients 
      with SLE.
