TI  - Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients?
PG  - 343-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: First, to establish whether a deprivation gradient in all-cause 
      mortality exists for all ethnic groups within New Zealand; second, if such 
      gradients do exist, whether their absolute slopes are the same; and third, if 
      such gradients exist, what impact the unequal deprivation distributions of the 
      different ethnic groups have on the observed ethnic inequalities in life 
      expectancy at birth. METHOD: Abridged lifetables for the period 1999-2003 were 
      constructed using standard demographic methods for each of four ethnic groups 
      (Asian, Pacific, Maori and European) by NZDep2001 quintile and sex. Gradients 
      were estimated by fitting generalised linear models to the quintile-specific life 
      expectancy estimates for each ethnic group (by sex). The contribution of 
      variation in deprivation distributions to inter-ethnic inequalities in life 
      expectancy was estimated by re-weighting the quintile-specific mortality rates 
      for each ethnic group using weights derived from the European deprivation 
      distribution and recalculating the lifetable. RESULTS: All four ethnic groups 
      exhibit deprivation gradients in all-cause mortality (life expectancy). Maori 
      show the steepest gradients, with slopes approximately 25% steeper than those of 
      Europeans for both males and females. By contrast, gradients among Asian and 
      Pacific peoples are shallower than those of their European counterparts. 
      CONCLUSION: While socio-economic gradients in health exist among all ethnic 
      groups, they are relatively shallow among Pacific and (especially) Asian peoples. 
      For these ethnic groups, caution should be exercised in applying deprivation or 
      other socio-economic measures as proxy indicators of need for health services.
