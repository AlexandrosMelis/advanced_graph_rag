      community violence?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 'law of spatiotemporal concentrations of events' introduced major 
      preventative shifts in policing communities. 'Hotspots' are at the forefront of 
      these developments yet somewhat understudied in emergency medicine. Furthermore, 
      little is known about interagency 'data-crossover', despite some developments 
      through the Cardiff Model. Can police-ED interagency data-sharing be used to 
      reduce community-violence using a hotspots methodology? METHODS: 12-month (2012) 
      descriptive study and analysis of spatiotemporal clusters of police and emergency 
      calls for service using hotspots methodology and assessing the degree of incident 
      overlap. 3775 violent crime incidents and 775 assault incidents analysed using 
      spatiotemporal clustering with k-means++ algorithm and Spearman's rho. RESULTS: 
      Spatiotemporal location of calls for services to the police and the ambulance 
      service are equally highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, 
      primarily within intra-agency hotspots (33% and 53%, respectively) but across 
      agencies' hotspots as well (25% and 15%, respectively). Datasets are 
      statistically correlated with one another at the 0.57 and 0.34 levels, with 50% 
      overlap when adjusted for the number of hotspots. At least one in every two 
      police hotspots does not have an ambulance hotspot overlapping with it, 
      suggesting half of assault spatiotemporal concentrations are unknown to the 
      police. Data further suggest that more severely injured patients, as estimated by 
      transfer to hospital, tend to be injured in the places with the highest number of 
      police-recorded crimes. CONCLUSIONS: A hotspots approach to sharing data 
      circumvents the problem of disclosing person-identifiable data between different 
      agencies. Practically, at least half of ambulance hotspots are unknown to the 
      police; if causal, it suggests that data sharing leads to both reduced community 
      violence by way of prevention (such as through anticipatory patrols or 
      problem-oriented policing), particularly of more severe assaults, and improved 
      efficiency of resource deployment.
