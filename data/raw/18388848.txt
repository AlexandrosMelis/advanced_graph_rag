AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines whether having a regular clinician for preventive 
      care is associated with quality of care for young children, as measured by 
      interpersonal quality ratings and content of anticipatory guidance. DATA SOURCE: 
      The National Survey of Early Childhood Health (NSECH), a nationally 
      representative parent survey of health care quality for 2068 young US children 
      fielded by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). STUDY DESIGN: 
      Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluate associations between having a 
      regular clinician for well child care and interpersonal quality, the content of 
      anticipatory guidance, and timely access to care. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In 
      bivariate analysis, parents of children with a regular clinician for preventive 
      care reported slightly higher interpersonal quality (69 vs. 65 on a 0-100 scale, 
      P = 0.01). Content of anticipatory guidance received was slightly greater for 
      children with a regular clinician (82 vs. 80 on a 0-100 scale, P = 0.03). In 
      bivariate analysis, a regular clinician was associated with interpersonal quality 
      only among African American and Hispanic children. In multivariate analyses, 
      controlling for factors that could independently influence self-reports of 
      experiences with care, interpersonal quality but not anticipatory guidance 
      content was higher for children with a regular clinician. CONCLUSIONS: Having a 
      regular primary care clinician is embraced in pediatrics, although team care 
      among physicians is also widely practiced. For young children, having a regular 
      clinician is associated with modest gains in interpersonal quality and no 
      differences in content of anticipatory guidance. The benefit of having a regular 
      clinician may primarily occur in interpersonal quality for subgroups of young 
      children.
