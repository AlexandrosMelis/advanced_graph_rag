      Care?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether hospital type is associated with differences in 
      total cost and outcomes for inpatient tonsillectomy. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional analysis of the 2006, 2009, and 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database 
      (KID). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Children </=18 years of age undergoing tonsillectomy 
      with/without adenoidectomy were included. Risk-adjusted generalized linear models 
      assessed for differences in hospital cost and length of stay (LOS) among children 
      managed by (1) non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs), (2) children's teaching 
      hospitals (CTHs), and (3) nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Risk-adjusted logistic 
      regression compared the odds of major perioperative complications (hemorrhage, 
      respiratory failure, death). Models accounted for clustering of patients within 
      hospitals, were weighted to provide national estimates, and controlled for 
      comorbidities. RESULTS: The 25,685 tonsillectomies recorded in the KID yielded a 
      national estimate of 40,591 inpatient tonsillectomies performed in 2006, 2009, 
      and 2012. The CTHs had significantly higher risk-adjusted total cost and LOS per 
      tonsillectomy compared with NCTHs and NTHs ($9423.34/2.8 days, $6250.78/2.11 
      days, and $5905.10/2.08 days, respectively; P < .001). The CTHs had higher odds 
      of complications compared with NCTHs (odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.15-1.91; P 
      = .002) but not when compared with NTHs (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89-1.59; P = .23). 
      The CTHs were significantly more likely to care for patients with comorbidities 
      (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in costs, outcomes, and patient 
      factors exist for inpatient tonsillectomy based on hospital type. Although 
      reasons for these differences are not discernable using isolated claims data, 
      findings provide a foundation to further evaluate patient, institutional, and 
      system-level factors that may reduce cost of care and improve value for inpatient 
      tonsillectomy.
