TI  - Is CA72-4 a useful biomarker in differential diagnosis between ovarian 
      endometrioma and epithelial ovarian cancer?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical excision of ovarian endometriomas in patients desiring 
      pregnancy has recently been criticized because of the risk of damage to healthy 
      ovarian tissue and consequent reduction of ovarian reserve. A correct diagnosis 
      in cases not scheduled for surgery is therefore mandatory in order to avoid 
      unexpected ovarian cancer misdiagnosis. Endometriosis is often associated with 
      high levels of CA125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating 
      ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim of this study was to 
      establish if the serum marker CA72-4 could be helpful in the differential 
      diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis and epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: 
      Serums CA125 and CA72-4 were measured in 72 patients with ovarian endometriomas 
      and 55 patients with ovarian cancer. RESULTS: High CA125 concentrations were 
      observed in patients with ovarian endometriosis and in those with ovarian cancer. 
      A marked difference in CA72-4 values was observed between women with ovarian 
      cancer (71.0%) and patients with endometriosis (13.8%) (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study suggests that CA72-4 determination can be useful to confirm the benign 
      nature of ovarian endometriomas in women with high CA125 levels.
