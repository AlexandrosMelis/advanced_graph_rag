AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was 
      to determine whether the deformity angular ratio (DAR) can reliably assess the 
      neurological risks of patients undergoing deformity correction. SUMMARY OF 
      BACKGROUND DATA: Identifying high-risk patients and procedures can help ensure 
      that appropriate measures are taken to minimize neurological complications during 
      spinal deformity corrections. Subjectively, surgeons look at radiographs and 
      evaluate the riskiness of the procedure. However, 2 curves of similar magnitude 
      and location can have significantly different risks of neurological deficit 
      during surgery. Whether the curve spans many levels or just a few can 
      significantly influence surgical strategies. Lenke et al have proposed the DAR, 
      which is a measure of curve magnitude per level of deformity. METHODS: The data 
      from 35 pediatric spinal deformity correction procedures with thoracic 3-column 
      osteotomies were reviewed. Measurements from preoperative radiographs were used 
      to calculate the DAR. Binary logistic regression was used to model the 
      relationship between DARs (independent variables) and presence or absence of an 
      intraoperative alert (dependent variable). RESULTS: In patients undergoing 
      3-column osteotomies, sagittal curve magnitude and total curve magnitude were 
      associated with increased incidence of transcranial motor evoked potential 
      changes. Total DAR greater than 45 degrees  per level and sagittal DAR greater than 22 degrees  
      per level were associated with a 75% incidence of a motor evoked potential alert, 
      with the incidence increasing to 90% with sagittal DAR of 28 degrees  per level. 
      CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing 3-column osteotomies for severe spinal 
      deformities, the DAR was predictive of patients developing intraoperative motor 
      evoked potential alerts. Identifying accurate radiographical, patient, and 
      procedural risk factors in the correction of severe deformities can help prepare 
      the surgical team to improve safety and outcomes when carrying out complex spinal 
      corrections. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.
