AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, the authors discussed the feasibility and value of 
      diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer 
      in addition to conventional nonenhanced MR images. METHODS AND MATERIALS: DW 
      images of endometrial cancer in 23 patients were examined by using a 1.5-T MR 
      scanner. This study investigated whether or not DW images offer additional 
      incremental value to conventional nonenhanced MR imaging in comparison with 
      histopathological results. Moreover, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) 
      values were measured in the regions of interest within the endometrial cancer and 
      compared with those of normal endometrium and myometrium in 31 volunteers, 
      leiomyoma in 14 patients and adenomyosis in 10 patients. The Wilcoxon rank sum 
      test was used, with a p<0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: In 19 
      of 23 patients, endometrial cancers were detected only on T2-weighted images. In 
      the remaining 4 patients, of whom two had coexisting leiomyoma, no cancer was 
      detected on T2-weighted images. This corresponds to an 83% detection sensitivity 
      for the carcinomas. When DW images and fused DW images/T2-weighted images were 
      used in addition to the T2-weighted images, cancers were identified in 3 of the 
      remaining 4 patients in addition to the 19 patients (overall detection 
      sensitivity of 96%). The mean ADC value of endometrial cancer (n=22) was 
      (0.97+/-0.19)x10(-3)mm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than those of the 
      normal endometrium, myometrium, leiomyoma and adenomyosis (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      DW imaging can be helpful in the detection of uterine endometrial cancer in 
      nonenhanced MR imaging.
