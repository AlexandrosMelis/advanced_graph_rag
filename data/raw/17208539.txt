TI  - Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the 
      transabdominal pull-through? A comparison of the 2 approaches for Hirschsprung 
      disease.
PG  - 41-7; discussion 47
AB  - PURPOSE: The transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT) is becoming the most 
      popular procedure in the treatment of Hirschsprung disease (HD), but 
      overstretching of the anal sphincters remains a critical issue that may impact 
      the continence. This study examined the long-term outcome of TERPT versus 
      conventional transabdominal (ABD) pull-through for HD. METHODS: Records of 41 
      patients more than 3 years old who underwent a pull-through for HD (TERPT, n = 
      20; ABD, n = 21) were reviewed, and their families were thoroughly interviewed 
      and scored via a 15-item post-pull-through long-term outcome questionnaire. 
      Patients were operated on between the years 1995 and 2003. During this time, our 
      group transitioned from the ABD to the TERPT technique. Total scoring ranged from 
      0 to 40: 0 to 10, excellent; 11 to 20 good; 21 to 30 fair; 31 to 40 poor. A 
      2-tailed Student t test, analysis of covariance, as well as logistic and linear 
      regression were used to analyze the collected data with confidence interval 
      higher than 95%. RESULTS: Overall scores were similar. However, continence score 
      was significantly better in the ABD group, and the stool pattern score was better 
      in the TERPT group. A significant difference in age at interview between the 2 
      groups was noted; we therefore reanalyzed the data controlling for age, and this 
      showed that age did not significantly affect the long-term scoring outcome 
      between groups. CONCLUSION: Our long-term study showed significantly better 
      (2-fold) results regarding the continence score for the abdominal approach 
      compared with the transanal pull-through. The stool pattern and enterocolitis 
      scores were somewhat better for the TERPT group. These findings raise an 
      important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases 
      will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.
