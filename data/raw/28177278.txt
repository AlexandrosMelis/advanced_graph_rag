AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis involving mainly 
      medium-sized arteries and, rarely, small-sized arteries. The diagnosis is 
      principally based on clinical exams, biopsy of an affected organ, and/or 
      arteriography of renal or mesenteric arteries. Once diagnosed, immunosuppressive 
      agents, such as glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, are generally introduced as 
      soon as possible. Whether spontaneous remission of PAN occurs is therefore 
      largely unknown. PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 51-year-old woman who 
      presented with a 4-day-history of intense pain in her left flank, hypertension, 
      fever, microscopic hematuria, and acute renal failure. Contrast-enhanced renal 
      ultrasound strongly suggested bilateral renal infarction. Medical history and an 
      extensive workup allowed to exclude systemic embolism, recreational drug abuse, 
      cardiac arrhythmias, and thrombophilia. A possible diagnosis of PAN was 
      considered; however, within 2 weeks of admission, spontaneous remission of her 
      clinical and biological symptoms occurred without the use of any 
      immunosuppressive treatment. Finally, 3 months later, renal arteriography 
      confirmed the diagnosis of PAN. The patient remains free of symptoms 1 year after 
      initial presentation. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the importance of 
      considering PAN in the differential diagnosis of renal infarction with 
      inflammatory syndrome and shows that spontaneous remission of renal PAN can 
      occur. .
