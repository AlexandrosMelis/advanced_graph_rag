TI  - Is ankle/arm pressure predictive for cardiovascular mortality in older patients 
      living in nursing homes?
PG  - 145-50
AB  - AIM: To identify whether Ankle/Arm Index (AAI) is a predictive factor for 
      cardiovascular mortality in institutionalised elderly. DESIGN: longitudinal 
      descriptive study. SETTING: 2 large nursing homes in Turin, Italy. SUBJECTS: 418 
      dependent elderly (83 males, 335 females, mean age 83.7+/-8.5 y, range 55-102) 
      living in the nursing homes. MEASUREMENTS: the prevalence of peripheral arterial 
      disease (PAD) was evaluated using a Doppler Ultrasound measurement of AAI 
      (Ankle/Arm blood pressure Index). Death causes according to ICD-9-CM were 
      ascertained on patient's clinical records. RESULTS: Diagnosis of PAD was made in 
      122 subjects (29.2%) with AAI <0.90. After a 3 year follow-up 203 patients 
      (48.6%) died. The presence of PAD was not related to total mortality or to 
      mortality for ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease or other 
      causes. IHD mortality was significantly and independently related to low 
      haemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy and poor 
      mobility conditions. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of PAD is high in nursing home 
      residents. AAI is not predictive for IHD mortality in this population. In very 
      frail elderly traditional risk factors and PAD are less important predictors of 
      death compared to poor functional status, nutritional factors and previous 
      cardiovascular disease.
