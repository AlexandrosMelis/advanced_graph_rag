      occupational cohort: is the prognosis dependent on the omnipresence of the 
      allergen?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin diseases are the most frequently recognized occupational 
      diseases in Denmark. The prognosis for occupational contact dermatitis is often 
      poor. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prognosis, assessed by eczema, job status 
      and skin-related quality of life, among patients allergic to rubber chemicals and 
      latex (ubiquitous allergens) and epoxy (nonubiquitous allergen), 2 years after 
      recognition of occupational allergic contact dermatitis. METHODS: From a cohort 
      of all patients recognized as having occupational dermatitis by the Danish 
      National Board of Industrial Injuries in 2010, 199 patients with relevant rubber 
      allergy (contact allergy to rubber chemicals or contact urticaria from latex) or 
      epoxy allergy were identified. Follow-up consisted of a questionnaire covering 
      current severity of eczema, employment, exposure and quality of life. RESULTS: 
      The response rate was 75%. Clearance of eczema was reported by 11% of patients 
      and 67% reported improvement. Overall 22% of patients with allergy to a 
      nonubiquitous allergen had total clearance of eczema compared with 10% of cases 
      allergic to ubiquitous allergens and 0% of those with contact urticaria 
      (P = 0.116). Improvement was significantly more frequent in those who had changed 
      jobs compared with those who had not (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: At follow-up, 
      patients with contact urticaria had significantly poorer prognosis than those 
      with contact allergy, and there was a trend towards a poorer prognosis for those 
      with contact allergy to rubber chemicals than those with allergy to epoxy. A 
      significant positive association between job change and improvement was found.
