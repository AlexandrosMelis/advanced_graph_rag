TI  - Reporting and interpreting red blood cell morphology: is there discordance 
      between clinical pathologists and clinicians?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical pathologists (CPs) report RBC morphologic (RBC-M) changes to 
      assist clinicians in prioritizing differential diagnoses. However, reporting is 
      subjective, semiquantitative, and potentially biased. Reporting decisions vary 
      among CPs, and reports may not be interpreted by clinicians as intended. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to survey clinicians and CPs about RBC-M 
      terms and their clinical value, and identify areas of agreement and discordance. 
      METHODS: Online surveys were distributed to small animal clinicians via the 
      Veterinary Information Network and to CPs via the ASVCP listserv. A quiz assessed 
      understanding of RBC-M terms among respondent groups. Descriptive statistics were 
      used to analyze responses to survey questions, and quiz scores were compared 
      among groups. RESULTS: Analyzable responses were obtained from 1662 clinicians 
      and 82 CPs. Both clinicians and CPs considered some terms, e.g., agglutination, 
      useful, whereas only CPs considered other terms, e.g., ghost cells, useful. All 
      groups interpreted certain terms, e.g., Heinz bodies, correctly, whereas some 
      clinicians misinterpreted others, e.g., eccentrocytes. Responses revealed that 
      CPs often do not report RBC-M they consider insignificant, when present in low 
      numbers. Twenty-eight percent of clinicians think CPs review all blood smears 
      while only 19% of CPs report reviewing all smears. CONCLUSIONS: Important 
      differences about the clinical relevance of certain RBC-M terms exist between 
      clinicians and CPs. Inclusion of interpretive comments on CBC reports is the 
      clearest way to ensure that RBC-M changes are interpreted as intended by the CP. 
      Reporting practices should be examined critically to improve communication, 
      transparency, and ultimately medical decisions.
