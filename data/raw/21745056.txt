AB  - BACKGROUND: The Pathway represents a longitudinal program for medical students, 
      consisting of both domestic and international experiences with poor populations. 
      A previous study reported no significant attitudinal changes toward the medically 
      indigent between Pathway and non-Pathway students. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      study was to investigate and differentiate the skills and attitudes of Pathway 
      and non-Pathway students in working with culturally diverse populations by 
      conducting quantitative and qualitative analyses. METHODS: Selected items from a 
      cultural assessment were analyzed using independent t-tests and a proportional 
      analysis using approximation of the binomial distribution. In addition, a 
      qualitative assessment of non-Pathway and Pathway students was conducted. 
      RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was found at the end of Years 2, 
      3, and 4 regarding student confidence ratings, and qualitative results had 
      similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: Clear and distinct differences between the two 
      studied groups were found indicating the root of this increased confidence may 
      have developed due to exposure to the Pathway program.
