AB  - PURPOSE: Although dose-volume parameters in image-guided brachytherapy have 
      become a standard, the use of posterior-inferior border of the pubic symphysis 
      (PIBS) points has been recently proposed in the reporting of vaginal doses. The 
      aim was to evaluate their pertinence. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Nineteen patients 
      who received image-guided brachytherapy after concurrent radiochemotherapy were 
      included. Per treatment, CT scans were performed at Days 2 and 3, with reporting 
      of the initial dwell positions and times. Doses delivered to the PIBS points were 
      evaluated on each plan, considering that they were representative of one-third of 
      the treatment. The movements of the applicator according to the PIBS point were 
      analysed. RESULTS: Mean prescribed doses at PIBS -2, PIBS, PIBS +2 were, 
      respectively, 2.23 +/- 1.4, 6.39 +/- 6.6, and 31.85 +/- 36.06 Gy. Significant 
      differences were observed between the 5 patients with vaginal involvement and the 
      remaining 14 at the level of PIBS +2 and PIBS: +47.60 Gy and +7.46 Gy, 
      respectively (p = 0.023 and 0.03). The variations between delivered and 
      prescribed doses at PIBS points were not significant. However, at International 
      commission on radiation units and measurements rectovaginal point, the delivered 
      dose was decreased by 1.43 +/- 2.49 Gy from the planned dose (p = 0.019). The 
      delivered doses at the four points were strongly correlated with the prescribed 
      doses with R(2) ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. The movements of the applicator in 
      regard of the PIBS point assessed with the Digital Imaging and Communications in 
      Medicine coordinates were insignificant. CONCLUSION: The doses evaluated at PIBS 
      points are not impacted by intrafractional movements. PIBS and PIBS +2 dose 
      points allow distinguishing the plans of patients with vaginal infiltration. 
      Further studies are needed to correlate these parameters with vaginal morbidity.
