TI  - Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of hand and finger joints in patients with early 
      rheumatoid arthritis: do we really need a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine for 
      assessing synovial enhancement at 3 T?

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the diagnostic value of a half dose compared with a full 
      dose of gadobenate dimeglumine in the assessment of synovitis or tenosynovitis in 
      the wrist and finger joints in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 
      a disease activity score greater than 3.2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With 
      institutional review board approval and informed consent, 57 patients with early 
      RA underwent 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with two different doses of 
      contrast media. The contrast enhancement was measured in inflamed synovial tissue 
      at half dose (0.05 mmol per kilogram of body weight) and at full dose (0.1 
      mmol/kg) by using T1-weighted sequences with fat saturation. The differences and 
      the correlation of signal intensities (SIs) at half- and full-dose sequences were 
      compared by using the paired t test and Pearson correlations. Image quality, 
      Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS), and tenosynovitis score on half- and 
      full-dose images were compared by two observers using the Wilcoxon test. 
      Interrater agreement was assessed by using kappa statistics. RESULTS: A significant 
      difference in SI was found between half-dose and full-dose gadobenate 
      dimeglumine-enhanced synovial tissue (mean: 914.35 +/- 251.1 vs 1022 +/- 244.5, P < 
      .001). Because the SI showed high correlation between the ratio at half dose and 
      full dose (r = 0.875), the formula, ratio of synovial enhancement to saline 
      syringe at full dose = 0.337 + 1.070 x ratio of synovial enhancement to saline 
      syringe at half dose, can be used to convert the normalized value of half dose to 
      full dose. However, no difference in RAMRIS (score 0 in 490 of 1026 joints; score 
      1 in 344; score 2 in 158; and score 3 in 34) or tenosynovitis scores in grading 
      synovitis or tenosynovitis in image quality and in assessment of synovial 
      enhancement was detected between half-dose and full-dose images (P = 1). 
      CONCLUSION: Postcontrast synovial SIs showed high correlation between half dose 
      and full dose, and image quality was rated identically. Therefore, half-dose 
      gadobenate dimeglumine at 3-T MR imaging may be sufficient for assessing 
      synovitis or tenosynovitis in early RA.
