      patients physically able to participate?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme is a clinical and 
      cost-effective programme for basic foot care in the elderly. The aim of this 
      study was to determine if patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) would be 
      physically able to participate. METHODS: A consecutive cohort of RA patients 
      undergoing podiatry care underwent tests for sight, reach and grip strength to 
      determine their physical ability to undertake self-managed foot care. RESULTS: 
      Thirty RA patients (10 male, 20 female), with a median age of 61 years (range 42 
      to 84) and disease duration of 10 years (range one to 40), were recruited. All 
      patients passed the sight test, whereas the reach and grip tests were passed by 
      77% and 67% of patients, respectively. Only 57% of patients passed all the 
      physical tests. Patients who failed the physical tests were older, and had longer 
      disease duration and higher physical disability, pain and general health scores 
      but these were not statistically different. CONCLUSIONS: Just over half the 
      patients in this present cohort may be physically able to undertake some aspects 
      of self-managed foot care, including nail clipping and filing, callus filing and 
      daily hygiene and inspection.
