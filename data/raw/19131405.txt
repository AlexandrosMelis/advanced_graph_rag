TI  - Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a 
      prediction of different histologic subtypes possible?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to determine the value of echo-planar 
      diffusion-weighted MR imaging (epiDWI) in differentiating various types of 
      primary parotid gland tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred forty-nine 
      consecutive patients with suspected tumors of the parotid gland were examined 
      with an epiDWI sequence by using a 1.5T unit. Image analysis was performed by 2 
      radiologists independently, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 
      computed. Histologic diagnosis was obtained in every patient. For comparison of 
      apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), a paired 2-tailed Student t test with a 
      Bonferroni correction was used. RESULTS: In 136 patients, a primary parotid gland 
      tumor was confirmed by histology. Among the observers, a high correlation was 
      calculated (0.98). ADC values of pleomorphic adenomas were significantly higher 
      than those of all other entities, except for myoepithelial adenomas (P = .054). 
      ADC values of Warthin tumors were different from those of myoepithelial adenomas, 
      lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas (P < .001, 0.013, and .037, respectively). 
      Mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas 
      were not differentiable from Warthin tumors (P = .094, .396, and .604, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: epiDWI has the potential to differentiate pleomorphic 
      adenoma and myoepithelial adenomas from all other examined entities. Due to an 
      overlap not only within the group of benign and malignant lesions but also 
      between groups, diagnoses should not be addressed on the basis of ADC values 
      solely. Therefore, further studies combining DWI, morphologic criteria, and 
      probably other MR imaging techniques seem warranted.
