TI  - Does elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae decrease peripheral 
      thrombophlebitis? A randomized controlled study.
PG  - 60-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral venous thrombophlebitis (PVT) is a common complication of 
      intravenous cannulation, occurring in about 30% of patients. We evaluated the 
      effect of elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours on the 
      incidence and severity of PVT in patients receiving intravenous fluids/drugs. 
      METHODS: We randomized 42 patients who were admitted for major abdominal surgery 
      to either the control or study group (n = 21 in either group). Informed consent 
      was obtained from all of them. Cannulae in the control group were removed only if 
      the site became painful, the cannula got dislodged or there were signs and 
      symptoms suggestive of PVT, namely pain, erythema, swelling, excessive warmth or 
      a palpable venous cord. Cannulae in the study group were changed and re-sited 
      electively every 48 hours. All the patients were examined every 24 hours for 
      signs and symptoms of PVT at the current and previous sites of infusion. RESULTS: 
      The incidence of PVT was 100% (21/21) in the control group and only 9.5% (2/21) 
      in the study group (p < 0.0001). The severity of PVT was also less in the study 
      group compared with that in the control group. Day-wise correlation of the 
      incidence of PVT showed that 82.6% of the episodes of PVT occurred on day 3. 
      CONCLUSION: Elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours results in 
      a significant reduction in the incidence and severity of PVT. We recommend that 
      this should be adopted as standard practice in managing all patients who require 
      prolonged intravenous therapy.
