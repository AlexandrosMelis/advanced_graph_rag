TI  - Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into 
      treatment?
PG  - 1495-1507
AB  - PURPOSE: There is increasing pressure on mental health providers to reduce the 
      duration of treatments, while retaining level of quality and effectiveness. The 
      risk is that the population is underserved and therefore needs new treatment 
      episodes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether duration of 
      treatment and return into mental health care were related. METHODS: This study 
      examined Dutch patients with an initial treatment episode in 2009 or 2010 in 
      specialized mental health settings for depressive disorder (N = 85,754). 
      Follow-up data about treatment episodes were available up until 2013. The data 
      set included demographic (age, gender), and clinical factors (comorbidity with 
      other DSM-IV Axis; scores on the 'Global Assessment of Functioning'). Cox 
      regression analyses were used to assess whether duration of treatment and relapse 
      into mental health care were related. RESULTS: The majority of patients did not 
      return into mental health care (86 %). Patients with a shorter duration of 
      treatment (5-250 min; 251-500 min and 751-1000 min) were slightly more likely to 
      return (reference group: >1000 min) (HR 1.19 95 % CI 1.13-1.26; HR 1.11 95 % CI 
      1.06-1.17; HR 1.18 95 % CI 1.11-1.25), adjusted for demographic and clinical 
      variables. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment 
      may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of 
      the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, 
      preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower 
      intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.
