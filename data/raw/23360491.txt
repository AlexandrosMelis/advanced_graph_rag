AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study asked whether the processing of affective prosody 
      is modulated by spatial attention. Pseudo-words with a neutral, happy, 
      threatening, and fearful prosody were presented at two spatial positions. 
      Participants attended to one position in order to detect infrequent targets. 
      Emotional prosody was task irrelevant. The electro-encephalogram (EEG) was 
      recorded to assess processing differences as a function of spatial attention and 
      emotional valence. RESULTS: Event-related potentials (ERPs) differed as a 
      function of emotional prosody both when attended and when unattended. While 
      emotional prosody effects interacted with effects of spatial attention at early 
      processing levels (< 200 ms), these effects were additive at later processing 
      stages (> 200 ms). CONCLUSIONS: Emotional prosody, therefore, seems to be 
      partially processed outside the focus of spatial attention. Whereas at early 
      sensory processing stages spatial attention modulates the degree of emotional 
      voice processing as a function of emotional valence, emotional prosody is 
      processed outside of the focus of spatial attention at later processing stages.
