TI  - Digital Tomosynthesis: A Viable Alternative to Noncontrast Computed Tomography 
      for the Follow-Up of Nephrolithiasis?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Digital tomosynthesis (DT) is a new X-ray-based imaging technique that 
      allows image enhancement with minimal increase in radiation exposure. The purpose 
      of this study was to compare DT with noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) and 
      to evaluate its potential role for the follow-up of patients with nephrolithiasis 
      in a nonemergent setting. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with 
      nephrolithiasis at our institution that underwent NCCT and DT from July 2012 to 
      September 2013 was performed. Renal units (RUs) that did not undergo treatment or 
      stone passage were randomly assigned to two blinded readers, who recorded stone 
      count, size area (mm(2)), maximum stone length (mm), and location, for both DT 
      and NCCT. Mean differences per RU were compared. Potential variables affecting 
      stone detection rate, including stone size and body mass index (BMI), were 
      evaluated. Interobserver agreement was determined using the intraclass 
      correlation coefficient to measure the consistency of measurements made by the 
      readers. RESULTS: DT and NCCT demonstrated similar stone detection rates in terms 
      of stone counts and stone area mm(2). Of the 79 RUs assessed, 41 RUs showed exact 
      stone counts on DT and NCCT. The mean difference in stone area was 16.5 mm(2) 
      (-4.6 to 38.5), p = 0.121. The mean size of the largest stone on NCCT and DT was 
      9.27 and 8.87 mm, respectively. Stone size and BMI did not cause a significant 
      difference in stone detection rates. Interobserver agreement showed a strong 
      correlation between readers and adequate reproducibility. CONCLUSION: We found DT 
      to be a comparable imaging modality to NCCT for the detection of intrarenal 
      stones, without a significant effect from stone size and BMI and adequate 
      reproducibility between multiple readers. DT appears to be an ideal alternative 
      for following patients with nephrolithiasis due to its acceptable stone detection 
      rates, low radiation exposure, and decreased cost compared to NCCT.
