AB  - BACKGROUND: The alterations of echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) in 
      patients received left atrial appendage LAA occlusion therapy are still unclear. 
      The present study was to evaluate the influence of LAA occlusion device on 
      echocardiography and ECG changes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). 
      METHODS: Seventy-three patients who had undergone Watchman, LAmbre and Lefort 
      were enrolled in this study. Echocardiography and ECG results at pre- and 
      post-operation were collected. Besides, echocardiography was also performed 
      during follow-up visits at 1, 6 and 12months after discharge. RESULTS: After LAA 
      occlusion, a slight and measureable movement of QRS electric axis was observed in 
      most patients. The significant differences were also observed in heart rate (HR) 
      and the mean-mean QT interval between pre- and post-operation for all patients. 
      There existed no significant difference in echocardiographic parameters between 
      before and after device implantation. However, a larger left atrial (LA) diameter 
      was detected by echocardiography during follow-up visit at 6months when compared 
      with pre-operation parameters. Similarly, aortic root diameter (ARD) was also 
      larger during follow-up at 12months than the baseline dimension in pre-operation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: LAA occlusion device resulted in a slightly movement in QRS axis, 
      reduced HR and increased the mean-mean QT interval duration. In addition, LA 
      diameter and ARD seemed to be larger after device implantation.
