TI  - Is controlled ovarian stimulation in intrauterine insemination an acceptable 
      therapy in couples with unexplained non-conception in the perspective of multiple 
      pregnancies?
PG  - 701-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with intrauterine insemination 
      (IUI) is a common treatment in couples with unexplained non-conception. Induction 
      of multifollicular growth is considered to improve pregnancy outcome, but it 
      contains an increased risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation 
      syndrome. In this study the impact of the number of follicles (>14 mm) on the 
      ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) and multiple PR was evaluated in the first four 
      treatment cycles. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed in all 
      couples with unexplained non-conception undergoing COS-IUI in the Academic 
      Hospital of Maastricht. The main outcome measure was ongoing PR. Secondary 
      outcomes were ongoing multiple PR, number of follicles of >or=14 mm, and order of 
      treatment cycle. RESULTS: Three hundred couples were included. No significant 
      difference was found in ongoing PR between women with one, two, three or four 
      follicles respectively (P=0.54), but in women with two or more follicles 12/73 
      pregnancies were multiples. Ongoing PR was highest in the first treatment cycle 
      and declined significantly with increasing cycle order (P=0.006), while multiple 
      PR did not change. CONCLUSIONS: In COS-IUI for unexplained non-conception, 
      induction of more than one follicle did not improve the ongoing PR, but increased 
      the risk of multiple pregnancies. Multiple PR remained high in the first four 
      cycles with multifollicular stimulation. Therefore, in order to reduce the number 
      of multiple pregnancies, in all IUI cycles for unexplained non-conception 
      monofollicular growth should be aimed at.
