TI  - Does oxybutynin hydrochloride cause arrhythmia in children with bladder 
      dysfunction?
PG  - 202-4
AB  - AIM: Pediatric surgeons frequently encounter children presenting with voiding 
      dysfunction symptoms, including urgency, frequency, and incontinence. 
      Antimuscarinic agents Oxybutynin) are the main drugs used to treat patients with 
      overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, defined as urgency, with or without urgency 
      incontinence, usually with increased daytime frequency and nocturia. Increased QT 
      dispersion is known to be the cause of ventricular arrhythmia in various systemic 
      diseases and leads to increased mortality and morbidity. METHOD: This study 
      represents a subset of a complete data set, considering only those children aged 
      admitted to the Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Nephrology Clinics during the 
      period January 2011 to July 2012. RESULT: In this study, we have determined that 
      the QT interval changes significantly depending on the use of oxybutynin. The QT 
      changes increased cardiac arrhythmia in children. CONCLUSION: For this reason, 
      children using such drugs should be closely monitored for cardiac arrhythmia.
