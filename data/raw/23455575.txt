AB  - OBJECTIVES: The so-called "globulomaxillary cyst", described as a fissural cyst, 
      caused by entrapped epithelium between the nasal and maxillary process, is no 
      longer considered for its own entity. Nevertheless, cystic lesions, which 
      correspond to the previous image of globulomaxillary cysts, do still occur in 
      daily practice. This raises the question to which entities pathological processes 
      in this particular region actually belong to. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 
      retrospective study, 17 cases (12 men and 5 women, 12-59 years old) of primarily 
      diagnosed globulomaxillary cysts are analysed according to clinical, radiological 
      and histological aspects, catamnestic processed and assigned to a new entity. The 
      results are compared with the international literature and draws conclusions on 
      the diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. RESULTS: Seven lateral periodontal 
      cysts, four radicular cysts, two keratocystic odontogenic tumours, one 
      adenomatoid odontogenic tumour, one periapical granuloma, one residual cyst and 
      one undefined jaw cyst were determined. CONCLUSIONS: According to the results of 
      our study and the data from the international literature, the entity 
      globulomaxillary cyst is no longer justified.
