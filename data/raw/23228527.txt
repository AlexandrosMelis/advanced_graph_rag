AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mechanically ventilated patients experience profound stress. 
      Interventions are needed to ameliorate stress that does not cause adverse 
      effects. The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of music on 
      stress in a sample of patients over the duration of ventilatory support. RESEARCH 
      METHODOLOGY/DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial; randomised patients (56.8+16.9 
      years, 61% male, APACHE III 57.2+18.3) receiving ventilatory support to: (1) 
      patient-directed music (PDM) where patients self-initiated music listening 
      whenever desired from a preferred collection, (2) headphones only to block ICU 
      noise, or (3) usual ICU care. Twenty-four hour urinary cortisol samples were 
      collected from a sub-set of subjects with intact renal function and not receiving 
      medications known to influence cortisol levels (n=65). SETTING: 12 ICUs in the 
      Midwestern United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Urinary free cortisol (UFC), an 
      integrative biomarker of stress. RESULTS: Controlling for illness severity, 
      gender, and baseline UFC (29-45 mg/day), mixed models analysis revealed no 
      significant differences among groups in UFC over the course of ventilatory 
      support. CONCLUSION: While music did not significantly reduce cortisol, less 
      profound spikes in UFC levels were observed but that, given the limitations of 
      the research, this observation could have occurred merely by chance.
