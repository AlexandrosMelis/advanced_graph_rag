TI  - Does ambulatory process of care predict health-related quality of life outcomes 
      for patients with chronic disease?
PG  - 63-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The validity of quality of care measurement has important implications 
      for practicing clinicians, their patients, and all involved with health care 
      delivery. We used empirical data from managed care patients enrolled in west 
      coast physician organizations to test the hypothesis that observed changes in 
      health-related quality of life across a 2.5-year window reflecting process of 
      care. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Patient self-report data as well as clinically 
      detailed medical record review regarding 963 patients with chronic disease 
      associated with managed care from three west coast states. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Prospective cohort study of change in health-related quality of life scores 
      across 30 months as measured by change in SF-12 physical component scores. DATA 
      COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Patient self-report and medical record 
      abstraction. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found a positive relationship between better 
      process scores and higher burden of illness (p<.05). After adjustment for burden 
      of illness, using an instrumental variables approach revealed better process is 
      associated with smaller declines in SF-12 scores across a 30-month observation 
      window (p=.014). The application of the best quartile of process of care to 
      patients currently receiving poor process is associated with a 4.24 increment in 
      delta SF-12-physical component summary scores. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 
      instrumental variables allowed us to demonstrate a significant relationship 
      between better ambulatory process of care and better health-related quality of 
      life. This finding underscores the importance of efforts to improve the process 
      of care.
