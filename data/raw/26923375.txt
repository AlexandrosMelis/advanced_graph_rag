      hepatic cirrhosis possible by duplex Doppler ultrasonography?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Esophageal varices are present in 30% to 40% of patients in 
      compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) and in 60% to 85% of patients in 
      decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh classes B and C). It is important to identify 
      patients with compensated cirrhosis at risk for esophageal varix development. We 
      evaluated the accuracy of a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index for predicting 
      the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated 
      hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) by using endoscopy as the reference 
      standard. METHODS: Fifty-six enrolled patients underwent duplex Doppler 
      ultrasonography followed by screening endoscopy. Mean portal vein velocity (PVV), 
      splenic index (SI), splenoportal index (SPI), hepatic and splenic arterial 
      resistive, and pulsatility indices (hepatic artery resistive index [HARI], 
      hepatic artery pulsatility index [HAPI], splenic artery resistive index [SARI], 
      splenic artery pulsatility index [SAPI]) were recorded. Univariate logistic 
      regression analysis was followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
      construction for the indices that were significant. RESULTS: The indices HARI, 
      HAPI, SARI, SAPI were not helpful (p > 0.05). Mean PVV, SI, and SPI were all 
      predictive of the presence of esophageal varices (p < 0.05) and SPI was found to 
      be the most accurate parameter. Of the various cut-off levels of SPI evaluated, a 
      cut-off value of SPI at 5.0, offered the highest diagnostic accuracy (88%). For 
      the 28 patients with SPI <5.0, the absence of esophageal varices in 27 of them 
      could be correctly diagnosed using only SPI without invasive screening endoscopy, 
      with high negative predictive value (96%) and sensitivity (96%). Of the remaining 
      28 patients with SPI >/=5.0, presence of esophageal varices could be similarly 
      correctly diagnosed in 22 of them by using SPI without screening endoscopy, with 
      high positive predictive value (79%) and specificity (82%). CONCLUSION: The SPI 
      was accurate in predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in 
      patients with compensated cirrhosis.
