TI  - Do risk factors for suicidal behavior differ by affective disorder polarity?
PG  - 763-71
LID - 10.1017/S0033291708004078 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death and has been strongly associated 
      with affective disorders. The influence of affective disorder polarity on 
      subsequent suicide attempts or completions and any differential effect of suicide 
      risk factors by polarity were assessed in a prospective cohort. METHOD: 
      Participants with major affective disorders in the National Institute of Mental 
      Health (NIMH) Collaborative Depression Study (CDS) were followed prospectively 
      for up to 25 years. A total of 909 participants meeting prospective diagnostic 
      criteria for major depressive and bipolar disorders were followed through 4204 
      mood cycles. Suicidal behavior was defined as suicide attempts or completions. 
      Mixed-effects, grouped-time survival analysis assessed risk of suicidal behavior 
      and differential effects of risk factors for suicidal behavior by polarity. In 
      addition to polarity, the main effects of age, gender, hopelessness, married 
      status, prior suicide attempts and active substance abuse were modeled, with mood 
      cycle as the unit of analysis. RESULTS: After controlling for age of onset, there 
      were no differences in prior suicide attempts by polarity although bipolar 
      participants had more prior severe attempts. During follow-up, 40 cycles ended in 
      suicide and 384 cycles contained at least one suicide attempt. Age, hopelessness 
      and active substance abuse but not polarity predicted suicidal behavior. The 
      effects of risk factors did not differ by polarity. CONCLUSIONS: Bipolarity does 
      not independently influence risk of suicidal behavior or alter the influence of 
      well-established suicide risk factors within affective disorders. Suicide risk 
      assessment strategies may continue to appraise these common risk factors without 
      regard to mood polarity.
