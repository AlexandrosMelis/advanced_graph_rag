      and driving convictions for stroke survivors: do they agree?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research on stroke survivors' driving safety has typically used either 
      self-reports or government records, but the extent to which the 2 may differ is 
      not known. We compared government records and self-reports of motor vehicle 
      collisions and driving convictions in a sample of stroke survivors. METHODS: The 
      56 participants were originally recruited for a prospective study on driving and 
      community re-integration post-stroke; the study population consisted of 
      moderately impaired stroke survivors without severe communication disorders who 
      had been referred for a driving assessment. The driving records of the 56 
      participants for the 5 years before study entry and the 1-year study period were 
      acquired with written consent from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario 
      (MTO), Canada. Self-reports of collisions and convictions were acquired via a 
      semistructured interview and then compared with the MTO records. RESULTS: 
      Forty-three participants completed the study. For 7 (13.5%) the MTO records did 
      not match the self-reports regarding collision involvement, and for 9 (17.3%) the 
      MTO records did not match self-reports regarding driving convictions. The kappa 
      coefficient for the correlation between MTO records and self-reports was 0.52 for 
      collisions and 0.47 for convictions (both in the moderate range of agreement). 
      When both sources of data were consulted, up to 56 percent more accidents and up 
      to 46 percent more convictions were identified in the study population in the 5 
      years before study entry compared to when either source was used alone. 
      CONCLUSION: In our population of stroke survivors, self-reports of motor vehicle 
      collisions and driving convictions differed from government records. In future 
      studies, the use of both government and self-reported data would ensure a more 
      accurate picture of driving safety post-stroke.
