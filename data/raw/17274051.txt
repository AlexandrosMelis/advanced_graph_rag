TI  - Metastatic carcinoma to the cervical nodes from an unknown head and neck primary 
      site: Is there a need for neck dissection?
PG  - 585-90
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes and patterns of 
      failure in patients with metastatic carcinoma to cervical lymph nodes from an 
      unknown head and neck primary origin, who were treated curatively with 
      radiotherapy, with or without neck dissection. METHODS: The study included 61 
      patients referred to the McGill University Hospital Centers from 1987 to 2002. 
      The median age was 57 years, with male to female ratio of 4:1. Distribution of 
      patients by N status was as follows: N1, 16 patients (26%); N2a, 18 (30%); N2b, 
      13 (22%); N2c, 7 (11%); and N3, 7 (11%). Twenty patients underwent neck 
      dissection (11 radical, 9 functional) and 41 patients had biopsy (9 fine-needle 
      aspiration and 32 excisional biopsy). All patients received radiotherapy. The 
      median dose to the involved node(s) was 64 Gy, and 60 Gy to the rest of the neck. 
      Treatment of the neck was bilateral in 50 patients (82%) and ipsilateral in 11 
      (18%). The minimum duration of the follow-up was 12 months, with the median of 32 
      months. RESULTS: The 5- and 8-year overall survival for the whole population was 
      79% and 67%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in 
      the 8-year actuarial overall survival (64.8% and 67.6%, respectively, p = .64) 
      and local relapse-free survival (75% vs 74.5%, respectively, p = .57), among 
      patients who had biopsy versus those who had neck dissection. CONCLUSION: In our 
      experience, definitive radiotherapy to the neck and the potential mucosal sites, 
      whether preceded by neck dissection or not, is effective to achieve a good local 
      control rate in the unknown primary cancer of the head and neck. The indication 
      for neck dissection, in particular for early nodal stage, is controversial.
