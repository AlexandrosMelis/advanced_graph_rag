AB  - PURPOSE: The present study aims to compare strength, healing, and operation time 
      of experimental intestinal anastomoses performed by polyglactin 910 (Vicryl; 
      Ethicon, Edinburgh, United Kingdom) sutures with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue 
      (Pattex; Henkel, Dusseldorf, Germany). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-six 
      Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 (groups E and L). Each group was further 
      subdivided into 6 subgroups (EA1, EA2, EA3, EB1, EB2, EB3, LA1, LA2, LA3, LB1, 
      LB2, LB3), each containing 8 rats. Intestinal anastomosis was performed by 
      polyglactin 910 sutures in A subgroups and with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate in B 
      subgroups. The anastomosis was end to end in A1 and B1, side to side in A2 and 
      B2, and end to side in A3 and B3. Time for anastomosis performance (AT) was 
      recorded. In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were 
      determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same 
      measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of 
      variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were 
      analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than 
      .05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of 
      subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT 
      were significantly better in B subgroups. CONCLUSION: Better healing, shorter AT, 
      and equal strength were achieved with ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate compared with 
      polyglactin 910 sutures in intestinal anastomosis in the experimental setting.
