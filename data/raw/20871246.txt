TI  - Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures: does it predict mortality, 
      transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of the 
      Young-Burgess classification system to predict mortality, transfusion 
      requirements, and nonorthopaedic injuries in patients with pelvic ring fractures 
      and to determine whether mortality rates after pelvic fractures have changed over 
      time. DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Level I trauma center. PATIENTS: One 
      thousand two hundred forty-eight patients with pelvic fractures during a 7-year 
      period. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Mortality at index 
      admission, transfusion requirement during first 24 hours, and presence of 
      nonorthopaedic injuries as a function of Young-Burgess pelvic classification 
      type. Mortality compared with historic controls. RESULTS: Despite a relatively 
      large sample size, the ability of the Young-Burgess system to predict mortality 
      only approached statistical significance (P = 0.07, Kruskal-Wallis). The 
      Young-Burgess system differentiated transfusion requirements--lateral compression 
      Type 3 (LC3) and anteroposterior compression Types 2 (APC2) and 3 (APC3) 
      fractures had higher transfusion requirements than did lateral compression Type 1 
      (LC1), anteroposterior compression Type 1 (APC1), and vertical shear (VS) (P < 
      0.05)--but was not as useful at predicting head, chest, or abdomen injuries. 
      Dividing fractures into stable and unstable types allowed the system to predict 
      mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and transfusion requirements. Overall 
      mortality in the study group was 9.1%, unchanged from original Young-Burgess 
      studies 15 years previously (P = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: The Young-Burgess system is 
      useful for predicting transfusion requirements. For the system to predict 
      mortality or nonorthopaedic injuries, fractures must be divided into stable 
      (APC1, LC1) and unstable (APC2, APC3, LC2, LC3, VS, combined mechanism of injury) 
      types. LC1 injuries are very common and not always benign (overall mortality 
      rate, 8.2%).
