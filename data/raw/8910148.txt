TI  - Transesophageal echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular function in 
      brain-dead patients: are marginally acceptable hearts suitable for 
      transplantation?
PG  - 708-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: The brain-dead donor supply has become one of the criteria limiting 
      the performance of heart transplantation. Conventional screening criteria are too 
      limiting and exclude suitable heart donors. Echocardiography is now widely 
      available and is a reliable tool to assess left ventricular dysfunction in 
      brain-dead donors. Yet few data are available on the degree of left ventricular 
      dysfunction where a transplantation is possible. METHODS: Fifty-five potential 
      brain-dead heart donors (age 38 +/- 11 years) were prospectively evaluated by 
      transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before harvesting. Fractional area change 
      (FAC) was used to assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead 
      donors. Transplanted hearts were evaluated on the fifth postoperative day. The 
      transplantation was considered a success if the recipient was alive, not 
      retransplanted, without an assistance device or an epinephrine infusion of more 
      than 1 mg/h and showed an ejection fraction above 40%. RESULTS: Of the 55 
      potential heart donors, 20 exhibited an FAC of less than 50%. Forty hearts were 
      harvested, 36 of which were successfully transplanted. Nine patients had an FAC 
      below 50% (group H2) and 27 had an FAC over 50% (group H1). Four patients died: 2 
      from hemorrhage (FAC > 50% in donors); 1 from right and one from left ventricular 
      dysfunction (FAC < 50% in donors). The FAC increased significantly from 51 +/- 
      15% to 57 +/- 11% in 18 hearts that underwent TEE in donors and afterwards in 
      recipients. Overall actuarial survival was 86.2% versus 64.6% at 1 and 2 years in 
      group H1 and group H2, respectively (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: TEE is useful to 
      assess left ventricular function in potential brain-dead donors. An FAC less than 
      50% is present in 36% of potential heart donors. Because left ventricular 
      dysfunction is often reversible shortly after transplantation, an FAC below 50% 
      may not necessarily preclude the use of hearts for transplantation.
