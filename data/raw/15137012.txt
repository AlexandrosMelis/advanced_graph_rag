TI  - Ovarian torsion in children: is oophorectomy necessary?
PG  - 750-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most pediatric surgeons perform oophorectomy in girls presenting with 
      ovarian torsion in which the ovary appears necrotic. However, the adult 
      gynecology literature suggests that many ovaries can be treated by detorsion 
      alone. METHODS: All children with ovarian torsion on the gynecology and general 
      surgery services between 1988 and 2002 were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 36 
      torsions in 34 children. Seventeen underwent detorsion with or without ovarian 
      cystectomy, and 19 had oophorectomy (mean age 10 years in both groups). Torsion 
      was suspected preoperatively in 94% of the detorsion cases and in 47% of the 
      oophorectomy patients. Median time from presentation to surgery was significantly 
      lower in the detorsion than the oophorectomy group (median 14 v 27 hours; P 
      =.04). Postoperative complications and length of stay were similar between the 2 
      groups. Despite the ovary being judged intraoperatively as moderately to severely 
      ischemic in 53% of the detorsion cases, follow-up sonogram or ovarian biopsy 
      available in 14 of the 17 cases showed normal ovary with follicular development 
      in each case. CONCLUSIONS: Simple detorsion was not accompanied by an increase in 
      morbidity, and all patients studied had functioning ovarian tissue on follow-up 
      despite the surgeon's assessment of the degree of ovarian ischemia. Detorsion is 
      the procedure of choice for most cases of ovarian torsion in children.
