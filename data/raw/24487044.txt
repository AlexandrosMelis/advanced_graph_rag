AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the target populations and drug efficacy, 
      toxicity, cost, and initiation age thresholds under which a pharmacologic regimen 
      for knee osteoarthritis (OA) prevention could be cost-effective. DESIGN: We used 
      the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) Model, a validated state-transition simulation 
      model of knee OA, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using disease-modifying 
      OA drugs (DMOADs) as prophylaxis for the disease. We assessed four cohorts at 
      varying risk for developing OA: (1) no risk factors, (2) obese, (3) history of 
      knee injury, and (4) high-risk (obese with history of knee injury). The base case 
      DMOAD was initiated at age 50 with 40% efficacy in the first year, 5% failure per 
      subsequent year, 0.22% major toxicity, and annual cost of $1,000. Outcomes 
      included costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Key parameters were varied in sensitivity 
      analyses. RESULTS: For the high-risk cohort, base case prophylaxis increased 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.04 and lifetime costs by $4,600, and 
      produced an ICER of $118,000 per QALY gained. ICERs >$150,000/QALY were observed 
      when comparing the base case DMOAD to the standard of care in the knee injury 
      only cohort; for the obese only and no risk factors cohorts, the base case DMOAD 
      was less cost-effective than the standard of care. Regimens priced at $3,000 per 
      year and higher demonstrated ICERs above cost-effectiveness thresholds consistent 
      with current US standards. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of DMOADs for OA 
      prevention for persons at high risk for incident OA may be comparable to other 
      accepted preventive therapies.
