TI  - Are the GFRUP's recommendations for withholding or withdrawing treatments in 
      critically ill children applicable? Results of a two-year survey.
PG  - 128-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate feasibility of the guidelines of the Groupe Francophone de 
      Reanimation et Urgence Pediatriques (French-speaking group of paediatric 
      intensive and emergency care; GFRUP) for limitation of treatments in the 
      paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). DESIGN: A 2-year prospective survey. 
      SETTING: A 12-bed PICU at the Hopital Jeanne de Flandre, Lille, France. PATIENTS: 
      Were included when limitation of treatments was expected. RESULTS: Of 967 
      children admitted, 55 were included with a 2-day median delay. They were younger 
      than others (24 v 60 months), had a higher paediatric risk of mortality (PRISM) 
      score (14 v 4), and a higher paediatric overall performance category (POPC) score 
      at admission (2 v 1); all p<0.002. 34 (50% of total deaths) children died. A 
      limitation decision was made without meeting for 7 children who died: 6 received 
      do-not-resuscitate orders (DNROs) and 1 received withholding decision. 
      Decision-making meetings were organised for 31 children, and the following 
      decisions were made: 12 DNROs (6 deaths and 6 survivals), 4 withholding (1 death 
      and 3 survivals), with 14 withdrawing (14 deaths) and 1 continuing treatment 
      (survival). After limitation, 21 (31% of total deaths) children died and 10 
      survived (POPC score 4). 13 procedures were interrupted because of death and 11 
      because of clinical improvement (POPC score 4). Parents' opinions were obtained 
      after 4 family conferences (for a total of 110 min), 3 days after inclusion. The 
      first meeting was planned for 6 days after inclusion and held on the 7th day 
      after inclusion; 80% of parents were immediately informed of the decision, which 
      was implemented after half a day. CONCLUSIONS: GFRUPs procedure was applicable in 
      most cases. The main difficulties were anticipating the correct date for the 
      meeting and involving nurses in the procedure. Children for whom the procedure 
      was interrupted because of clinical improvement and who survived in poor 
      condition without a formal decision pointed out the need for medical criteria for 
      questioning, which should systematically lead to a formal decision-making 
      process.
