TI  - Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable 
      method for the histological assessment of breast lesions?
PG  - 393-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound may help to determine the 
      exact position of the needle during breast biopsy, thereby reducing the number of 
      core samples that are needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis. The 
      aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of 3D ultrasound-validated 
      large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) of the breast. METHODS: A total of 360 core 
      needle biopsies was obtained from 169 breast lesions in 146 patients. Additional 
      open breast biopsy was performed in 111 women (127/169 breast lesions); the 
      remaining 42 lesions were followed up for at least 24 months. 3D ultrasound 
      visualization of the needle in the postfiring position was used to classify the 
      biopsy as central, marginal or outside the lesion. Based on this classification 
      it was decided whether another sample had to be obtained. RESULTS: A median of 
      two core samples per lesion provided for all the lesions a sensitivity for 
      malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0% and 
      false-negative rate of 3.1%, and for the excised lesions a sensitivity of 96.5%, 
      specificity of 100%, false-positive rate of 0%, false-negative rate of 3.5% and 
      an underestimation rate of 3.4%. CONCLUSIONS: 3D ultrasound validation of the 
      postfiring needle position is an efficient adjunct to ultrasound-guided LCNB. The 
      advantages of 3D ultrasound validation are likely to include a reduction in the 
      number of core samples needed to achieve a reliable histological diagnosis (and a 
      possible reduction in the risk of tumor cell displacement), reduced procedure 
      time and lower costs.
