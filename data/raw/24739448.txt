AB  - OBJECTIVE: In January 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) communicated 
      concerns and, in May 2009, issued a warning about an increased risk of 
      suicidality for all antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This research evaluated the 
      association between the FDA suicidality communications and the AED prescription 
      claims among members with epilepsy and/or psychiatric disorder. METHODS: A 
      longitudinal interrupted time-series design was utilized to evaluate Oklahoma 
      Medicaid claims data from January 2006 through December 2009. The study included 
      9289 continuously eligible members with prevalent diagnoses of epilepsy and/or 
      psychiatric disorder and at least one AED prescription claim. Trends, expressed 
      as monthly changes in the log odds of AED prescription claims, were compared 
      across three time periods: before (January 2006 to January 2008), during 
      (February 2008 to May 2009), and after (June 2009 to December 2009) the FDA 
      warning. RESULTS: Before the FDA warning period, a significant upward trend of 
      AED prescription claims of 0.01% per month (99% CI: 0.008% to 0.013%, p<0.0001) 
      was estimated. In comparison to the prewarning period, no significant change in 
      trend was detected during (-20.0%, 99% CI: -70.0% to 30.0%, p=0.34) or after 
      (80.0%, 99% CI: -20.0% to 200.0%, p=0.03) the FDA warning period. After 
      stratification, no diagnostic group (i.e., epilepsy alone, epilepsy and comorbid 
      psychiatric disorder, and psychiatric disorder alone) experienced a significant 
      change in trend during the entire study period (p>0.01). CONCLUSIONS: During the 
      time period considered, the FDA AED-related suicidality warning does not appear 
      to have significantly affected prescription claims of AED medications for the 
      study population.
