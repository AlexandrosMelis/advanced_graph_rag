TI  - Should all patients be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to 
      avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Optimization of the preoperative hemoglobin (Hb) level 
      is an effective way to reduce allogeneic transfusion in total knee arthroplasty 
      (TKA) though the procedure is expensive, requires close monitoring and is often 
      inconvenient for patients with reduced mobility. Our aim was to investigate the 
      value of preoperative Hb levels to predict transfusion and thereby tailoring Hb 
      optimization to patient characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive 
      patients who undergone primary TKA in our center over 2 years, and received 
      tranexamic acid intraoperatively, were reviewed. The adjusted association between 
      preoperative Hb levels and transfusion was assessed by multivariate logistic 
      regression, and the estimated probability of transfusion for individual patients 
      was derived from the logistic model. RESULTS: Out of the 784 patients who meet 
      the inclusion criteria, risk of transfusion was associated with poorer 
      performance status, as measured by the America Association of Anestesiology (ASA) 
      score III/IV (OR: 3.3, P < 0.001) and lower preoperative Hb level (OR 3.8 for 
      each g/dl below 13 g/dl; P < 0.001). According to the Hb level, the estimated 
      probability of transfusion was 0.03 (range: 0.03-0.64) for ASA I/II patients and 
      0.10 (range: 0.10-0.84) for ASA III/IV. CONCLUSION: Not all the patients 
      undergoing TKA who receive tranexamic acid need the same preoperative Hb 
      optimization target. Two easily available factors, such as the ASA score and the 
      Hb level, can help individualize the Hb optimization target.
