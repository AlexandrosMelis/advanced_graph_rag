TI  - Does a geriatric oncology consultation modify the cancer treatment plan for 
      elderly patients?
PG  - 724-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was performed to describe the treatment plan modifications 
      after a geriatric oncology clinic. Assessment of health and functional status and 
      cancer assessment was performed in older cancer patients referred to a cancer 
      center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 2004 and May 2005, 105 patients 70 
      years old or older referred to a geriatric oncology consultation at the Institut 
      Curie cancer center were included. Functional status, nutritional status, mood, 
      mobility, comorbidity, medication, social support, and place of residence were 
      assessed. Oncology data and treatment decisions were recorded before and after 
      this consultation. Data were analyzed for a possible correlation between one 
      domain of the assessment and modification of the treatment plan. RESULTS: Patient 
      characteristics included a median age of 79 years and a predominance of women 
      with breast cancer. About one half of patients had an independent functional 
      status. Nearly 15% presented severe undernourishment. Depression was suspected in 
      53.1% of cases. One third of these patients had >2 chronic diseases, and 74% of 
      patients took > or =3 medications. Of the 93 patients with an initial treatment 
      decision, the treatment plan was modified for 38.7% of cases after this 
      assessment. Only body mass index and the absence of depressive symptoms were 
      associated with a modification of the treatment plan. CONCLUSION: The geriatric 
      oncology consultation led to a modification of the cancer treatment plan in more 
      than one third of cases. Further studies are needed to determine whether these 
      modifications improve the outcome of these older patients.
