AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the reliability of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to 
      assess bone density and the microstructure of the maxillary bones at the alveolar 
      process in human clinics by direct comparison with conventional stereologic-based 
      histomorphometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analysis of osseous microstructural 
      variables including bone volumetric density (BV/TV) of 39 biopsies from the 
      maxillary alveolar bone was performed by micro-CT. Conventional stereologic-based 
      histomorphometry of 10 bone biopsies was performed by optic microscopy (OM) and 
      low-vacuum surface electronic microscopy (SEM). Percentages of bone between 
      micro-CT and conventional stereologic-based histomorphometry were compared. 
      RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were observed between BV/TV and the 
      percentage of bone (%Bone) analyzed by SEM (r = 0.933, P < 0.001), by toluidine 
      blue staining OM (r = 0.950, P < 0.001) and by dark field OM (r = 0.667, 
      P = 0.05). The high positive correlation coefficient between BV/TV and trabecular 
      thickness illustrates that a value of BV/TV upper than 50% squares with a bone 
      presenting most of their trabecules thicker than 0.2 mm. The high negative 
      correlation between BV/TV and trabecular separation shows that values of BV/TV 
      upper than 50% squares with a bone presenting most of their trabecules separated 
      less than 0.3 mm each other. CONCLUSION: BV/TV assessed by micro-CT correlates 
      with the percentage of bone assessed by conventional stereologic-based 
      histomorphometry. Micro-CT is a reliable technique to determine the bone density 
      and the microstructure of the maxillary alveolar bone at the site of dental 
      implant insertion.
