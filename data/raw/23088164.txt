AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the relationship between cognitive ability 
      and frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and 
      normal cognition. DESIGN: Speech-in-noise recognition was measured using 
      Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers sentences presented over 
      earphones at 65 dB SPL and a range of signal-to-noise ratios. There were three 
      conditions: unprocessed, and at frequency compression ratios of 2:1 and 3:1 
      (cut-off frequency, 1.6 kHz). Working memory and cognitive ability were measured 
      using the reading span test and the trail making test, respectively. STUDY 
      SAMPLE: Participants were 15 young normally-hearing adults with normal cognition. 
      RESULTS: There was a statistically significant reduction in mean speech 
      recognition from around 80% when unprocessed to 40% for 2:1 compression and 30% 
      for 3:1 compression. There was a statistically significant relationship between 
      speech recognition and cognition for the unprocessed condition but not for the 
      frequency-compressed conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between cognitive 
      functioning and recognition of frequency compressed speech-in-noise was not 
      statistically significant. The findings may have been different if the 
      participants had been provided with training and/or time to 'acclimatize' to the 
      frequency-compressed conditions.
