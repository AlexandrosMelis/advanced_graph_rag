AB  - PURPOSE: A higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CRFs) in 
      HIV-infected patients, together with chronic infection and treatments, has 
      resulted in an increased risk of silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI). The objective 
      of this study was to evaluate whether myocardial SPECT should be used for 
      screening HIV-infected patients with no clinical symptoms of coronary artery 
      disease. METHODS: The prevalence of SMI detected by myocardial SPECT was 
      determined in 94 HIV-infected patients with a normal clinical cardiovascular 
      examination in relation to anthropomorphic parameters, CRFs, inflammatory and HIV 
      infection status, and treatment. RESULTS: Coronary artery disease was detected in 
      nine patients (eight with ischaemia, one with myocardial infarction), 
      corresponding to 9.6 % positivity. All but two of the scintigraphic diagnoses of 
      ischaemia were confirmed by coronarography. Univariate analysis revealed that the 
      overall number of CRFs and the combination of gender and age were associated with 
      a diagnosis of SMI (p < 0.05). According to multivariate analysis, the only 
      independent parameter significantly associated with the scintigraphic diagnosis 
      of SMI was the combination of gender and age (p = 0.01). All the positive 
      myocardial SPECT scans were in men older than 52 years with at least two other 
      CRFs. In this subpopulation of 47 patients, the prevalence of SMI detected by 
      myocardial SPECT reached 19.2 %. CONCLUSION: In male HIV-infected patients older 
      than 52 years and with at least two other CRFs, screening for SMI using 
      myocardial SPECT was about four times more likely to be positive than in the 
      general population. This may motivate physicians to advise these patients to 
      undergo more systematic screening for SMI using this technique.
