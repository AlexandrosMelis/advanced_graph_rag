AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential effects of binge drinking during pregnancy on child 
      motor function have only been assessed in a few, small studies. We aimed to 
      examine the effects of binge alcohol consumption during early pregnancy, 
      including number of binge episodes and timing of binge drinking, on child motor 
      function at age 5. METHODS: We performed a prospective follow-up study of 678 
      women and their children sampled from the Danish National Birth Cohort based on 
      maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. At 5 years of age, the children 
      were tested with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children. Parental 
      education, maternal IQ, prenatal maternal smoking, the child's age at testing, 
      sex of child, and tester were considered core confounders, while the full model 
      also controlled for prenatal maternal average alcohol intake, maternal age and 
      prepregnancy body mass index, parity, home environment, postnatal parental 
      smoking, health status, participation in organized sport, and indicators for 
      hearing and vision impairment. RESULTS: There were no systematic or significant 
      differences in motor function between children of mothers reporting isolated 
      episodes of binge drinking and children of mothers with no binge episodes. No 
      association was observed with respect to the number of binge episodes (maximum of 
      12) and timing of binge drinking. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found no 
      systematic association between isolated episodes of binge drinking during early 
      pregnancy and child motor function at age 5.
