AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate a clinical diagnostic tool, used by emergency physicians 
      (EPs), to diagnose the central cause of patients presenting with vertigo, and to 
      determine interrater reliability of this tool. METHODS: A convenience sample of 
      adult patients presenting to a single academic ED with isolated vertigo (i.e. 
      vertigo without other neurological deficits) was prospectively evaluated with 
      STANDING (SponTAneousNystagmus, Direction, head Impulse test, standiNG) by five 
      trained EPs. The first step focused on the presence of spontaneous nystagmus, the 
      second on the direction of nystagmus, the third on head impulse test and the 
      fourth on gait. The local standard practice, senior audiologist evaluation 
      corroborated by neuroimaging when deemed appropriate, was considered the 
      reference standard. Sensitivity and specificity of STANDING were calculated. On 
      the first 30 patients, inter-observer agreement among EPs was also assessed. 
      RESULTS: Five EPs with limited experience in nystagmus assessment volunteered to 
      participate in the present study enrolling 98 patients. Their average evaluation 
      time was 9.9 +/- 2.8 min (range 6-17). Central acute vertigo was suspected in 16 
      (16.3%) patients. There were 13 true positives, three false positives, 81 true 
      negatives and one false negative, with a high sensitivity (92.9%, 95% CI 70-100%) 
      and specificity (96.4%, 95% CI 93-38%) for central acute vertigo according to 
      senior audiologist evaluation. The Cohen's kappas of the first, second, third and 
      fourth steps of the STANDING were 0.86, 0.93, 0.73 and 0.78, respectively. The 
      whole test showed a good inter-observer agreement (k = 0.76, 95% CI 0.45-1). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the hands of EPs, STANDING showed a good inter-observer agreement 
      and accuracy validated against the local standard of care.
