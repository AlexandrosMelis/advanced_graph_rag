TI  - Vertical lines in distal esophageal mucosa (VLEM): a true endoscopic 
      manifestation of esophagitis in children?
PG  - 485-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We observed an endoscopic abnormally in a group of children with 
      histological esophagitis. We termed this finding "vertical lines in esophageal 
      mucosa" (VLEM). We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and 
      significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies. METHODS: Between 
      January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 
      esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and 
      histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic 
      appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a 
      blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies. RESULTS: The esophageal mucosa had 
      a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only 
      mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 
      160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most 
      patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%, specificity 
      0.85, sensitivity 0.5, p > 0.001) which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 
      of 34, 91.2%, specificity 0.88, sensitivity 0.73, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Histology usually demonstrated moderate to severe inflammation when VLEM were 
      present. VLEM may be a highly specific endoscopic feature of esophagitis in 
      children.
