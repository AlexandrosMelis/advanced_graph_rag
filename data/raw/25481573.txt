AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which the title and font of participant 
      information sheets (PISs) can influence pregnant women's and trainee midwives' 
      perceptions of an antenatal intervention. METHODS: Pregnant women (n=35) and 
      trainee midwives (n=36) were randomly presented with one of four PISs where the 
      title and font of the PIS had been manipulated to create four experimental 
      conditions (i.e., Double Fluent; Double Awkward; Fluent Title-Awkward Font; 
      Awkward Title-Fluent Font). After reading the PIS, participants rated their 
      perceptions of the intervention (i.e., Attractiveness, Complexity, Expected Risk, 
      Required Effort) using five-point Likert scales. RESULTS: A 4x2 factorial 
      multivariate analysis of variance revealed that pregnant women rated the Double 
      Awkward condition as significantly more complex than the Double Fluent (p=.024) 
      and Awkward Title-Fluent Font (p=.021) conditions. CONCLUSION: Font influenced 
      pregnant women's ratings of intervention complexity. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: 
      Results have implications for ethical recruitment, and in turn, the optimisation 
      of corresponding interventions.
