AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the risks of haemodynamic instability, and the possible 
      occurrence of spinal haematoma, meningitis and epidural abscess when epidural 
      analgesia is performed for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
      chemotherapy (HIPEC). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 35 
      patients treated by HIPEC with oxaliplatin or cisplatin. An epidural catheter was 
      inserted before induction of general anaesthesia. Postoperatively, a continuous 
      epidural infusion of ropivacain, then a patient-controlled epidural analgesia 
      were started. RESULTS: The epidural catheter was used peroperatively before HIPEC 
      in 12 subjects (34%), and after HIPEC in 23 subjects (66%). The median dose of 
      ropivacain given peroperatively in the epidural catheter was 40 mg (30-75). 
      Norepinephrin was used in two subjects (6%) peroperatively (median infusion rate 
      0.325 mug/kg per minute [0.32-0.33]), and in four subjects (11%) in the 
      postoperative 24 hours. No spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess were 
      noted. Five subjects (14%) had a thrombopenia or a prothrombin time less than 60% 
      before catheter removal. Two subjects (6%) had a leukopenia before catheter 
      removal. No thrombopenia or blood coagulation disorders were recorded the day of 
      catheter removal. CONCLUSION: In this series of 35 patients, the use of epidural 
      analgesia for HIPEC does not seem to be associated with a worse risk of 
      haemodynamic instability, spinal haematoma, meningitis or epidural abscess. HIPEC 
      with platinum salt is not incompatible with the safety of epidural analgesia, 
      with an optimized fluid management peroperatively and the following of 
      perimedullary anesthesia practice guidelines.
