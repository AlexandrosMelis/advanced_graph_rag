TI  - Should all human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with end-stage renal 
      disease be excluded from transplantation? The views of U.S. transplant centers.
PG  - 1187-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients have generally 
      been excluded from transplantation. Recent advances in the management and 
      prognosis of these patients suggest that this policy should be reevaluated. 
      METHODS: To explore the current views of U.S. transplant centers toward 
      transplanting asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, a 
      written survey was mailed to the directors of transplantation at all 248 renal 
      transplant centers in the United States. RESULTS: All 148 responding centers said 
      they require HIV testing of prospective kidney recipients, and 84% of these 
      centers would not transplant an individual who refuses HIV testing. The vast 
      majority of responding centers would not transplant a kidney from a cadaveric 
      (88%) or a living donor (91%) into an asymptomatic HIV-infected patient who is 
      otherwise a good candidate for transplantation. Among the few centers that would 
      consider transplanting an HIV-infected patient, not a single center had performed 
      such a transplant in the year prior to the survey. Most centers fear that 
      transplantation in the face of HIV infection would be harmful to the individual, 
      and some believe that it would be a waste of precious organs. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      great majority of U.S. renal transplant centers will not transplant kidneys to 
      HIV-infected patients with end-stage renal disease, even if their infection is 
      asymptomatic. However, advances in the management of HIV infection and a review 
      of relevant ethical issues suggest that this approach should be reconsidered.
