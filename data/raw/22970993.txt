AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine the effect of sex on the 
      outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in terms of operative time, conversion to 
      open cholecystectomy, postoperative complications and mean hospital stay. 
      METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed the medical 
      records of 2061 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the 
      surgical department of Khyber Teaching Hospital (Peshawar, Pakistan) between 
      March 2008 and January 2010. chi(2) test and t-test were respectively used to 
      analyze categorical and numerical variables. P </= 0.05 was considered significant. 
      RESULTS: The study included 1772 female and 289 male patients. The mean age for 
      male patients was 44.07 +/- 11.91 years compared to 41.29 +/- 12.18 years for female 
      patients (P = 0.706). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully completed in 
      1996 patients. The conversion rate was higher in men (P < 0.001), and the mean 
      operating time was longer in men (P < 0.001). Bile duct injuries occurred more 
      frequently in men (P < 0.001). Gallbladder perforation and gallstone spillage 
      also occurred more commonly in men (P = 0.001); similarly severe inflammation was 
      reported more in male patients (P = 0001). There were no statistically 
      significant differences in mean hospital stay, wound infection and port-site 
      herniation between men and women. Multivariate regression analysis showed that 
      the male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy 
      (odds ratio = 2.65, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-6.94, P = 0.041) and biliary 
      injuries (odds ratio = 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.99, 
      P-value = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is often challenging 
      in men on account of more adhesions and inflammation. This leads to higher 
      conversion rates and more postoperative complications. Optimized planning and a 
      more experienced operating surgeon may help overcome these problems.
