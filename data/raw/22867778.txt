      relative valuation approach to health care safety.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Health services often spend more on safety interventions than seems 
      cost-effective. This study investigates whether the public value safety-related 
      health care improvements more highly than the same improvements in contexts where 
      the health care system is not responsible. METHOD: An online survey was conducted 
      to elicit the relative importance placed on preventing harms caused by 1) health 
      care (hospital-acquired infections, drug administration errors, injuries to 
      health care staff), 2) individuals (personal lifestyle choices, sports-related 
      injuries), and 3) nature (genetic disorders). Direct valuations were obtained 
      from members of the public by using a person trade-off or "matching" method. 
      Participants were asked to choose between two preventative interventions of equal 
      cost and equal health benefit per person for the same number of people, but 
      differing in causation. If participants indicated a preference, their strength of 
      preference was measured by using person trade-off. RESULTS: Responses were 
      obtained from 1030 people, reflecting the sociodemographic mix of the UK 
      population. Participants valued interventions preventing hospital-acquired 
      infections (1.31) more highly than genetic disorders (1.0), although drug errors 
      were valued similarly to genetic disorders (1.07), and interventions to prevent 
      injury to health care staff were given less weight than genetic disorders (0.71). 
      Less weight was also given to interventions related to lifestyle (0.65) and 
      sports injuries (0.41). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that people do not attach 
      a simple fixed premium to "safety-related" interventions but that preferences 
      depend more subtly on context. The use of the results of such public preference 
      surveys to directly inform policy would therefore be premature.
