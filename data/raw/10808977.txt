TI  - Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?
PG  - 1-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telephone counseling and tailored print communications have emerged 
      as promising methods for promoting mammography screening. However, there has been 
      little research testing, within the same randomized field trial, of the efficacy 
      of these two methods compared to a high-quality usual care system for enhancing 
      screening. This study addressed the question: Compared to usual care, is tailored 
      telephone counseling more effective than tailored print materials for promoting 
      mammography screening? DESIGN: Three-year randomized field trial. PARTICIPANTS: 
      One thousand ninety-nine women aged 50 and older recruited from a health 
      maintenance organization in North Carolina. INTERVENTION: Women were randomized 
      to 1 of 3 groups: (1) usual care, (2) tailored print communications, and (3) 
      tailored telephone counseling. MAIN OUTCOME: Adherence to mammography screening 
      based on self-reports obtained during 1995, 1996, and 1997. RESULTS: Compared to 
      usual care alone, telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion 
      of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) than did tailored print (67% 
      vs 61%) but only after the first year of intervention (during 1996). Furthermore, 
      compared to usual care, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored 
      print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening during 1996 and 
      1997 among women who were off-schedule during the previous year. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      effects of the intervention were most pronounced after the first intervention. 
      Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at 
      promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was 
      developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored 
      print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent 
      women on schedule for mammography screening. Many questions would have to be 
      answered about why the tailored print intervention was not more powerful. 
      Nevertheless, it is clear that additional interventions will be needed to 
      maintain women's adherence to mammography. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): 
      mammography screening, telephone counseling, tailored print communications,
