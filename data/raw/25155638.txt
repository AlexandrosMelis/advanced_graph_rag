TI  - Can routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings reduce 
      racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccination remains below the federally targeted levels 
      outlined in Healthy People 2020. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, racial and 
      ethnic minorities are less likely to be vaccinated for influenza, despite being 
      at increased risk for influenza-related complications and death. Also, vaccinated 
      minorities are more likely to receive influenza vaccinations in office-based 
      settings and less likely to use non-medical vaccination locations compared to 
      non-Hispanic white vaccine users. OBJECTIVE: To assess the number of "missed 
      opportunities" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings by race and 
      ethnicity and the magnitude of potential vaccine uptake and reductions in racial 
      and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination if these "missed opportunities" 
      were eliminated. DESIGN: National cross-sectional Internet survey administered 
      between March 4 and March 14, 2010 in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Non-Hispanic black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic white adults living in the United 
      States (N = 3,418). MAIN MEASURES: We collected data on influenza vaccination, 
      frequency and timing of healthcare visits, and self-reported compliance with a 
      potential provider recommendation for vaccination during the 2009-2010 influenza 
      season. "Missed opportunities" for seasonal influenza vaccination in office-based 
      settings were defined as the number of unvaccinated respondents who reported at 
      least one healthcare visit in the Fall and Winter of 2009-2010 and indicated 
      their willingness to get vaccinated if a healthcare provider strongly recommended 
      it. "Potential vaccine uptake" was defined as the sum of actual vaccine uptake 
      and "missed opportunities." KEY RESULTS: The frequency of "missed opportunities" 
      for influenza vaccination in office-based settings was significantly higher among 
      racial and ethnic minorities than non-Hispanic whites. Eliminating these "missed 
      opportunities" could have cut racial and ethnic disparities in influenza 
      vaccination by roughly one half. CONCLUSIONS: Improved office-based practices 
      regarding influenza vaccination could significantly impact Healthy People 2020 
      goals by increasing influenza vaccine uptake and reducing corresponding racial 
      and ethnic disparities.
