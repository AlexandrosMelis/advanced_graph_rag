AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the contribution of chemical shift 
      magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of the margins of solid breast masses 
      by benefiting from India ink artifact. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-eight masses 
      in 64 patients were evaluated in T1- and T2-weighted images, dynamic contrast and 
      chemical shift studies according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 
      magnetic resonance lexicon. Subtraction images were automatically obtained by 
      chemical shift imaging and dynamic studies. Each sequence was scored using a 
      scale of 1 to 5 according to its ability to demonstrate margins separate from 
      surrounding parenchyma. Breast parenchyma was evaluated as fatty and dense. The 
      results were compared with the histopathologic results. RESULTS: Twenty-eight 
      (31.8%) of the lesions were localized in fatty breast, and the remaining 60 
      (68.2%) lesions were localized in dense breast. There were 34 (38.6%) benign and 
      54 (61.4%) malignant masses. In fatty breast, chemical shift subtraction and 
      T1-weighted images were valuable both for the demonstration and differentiation 
      of benign lesions (P < .05). None of the sequence was valuable for both the 
      demonstration and differentiation of malignant lesions in fatty breasts (P > 
      .05). In dense breasts, chemical shift subtraction and dynamic contrast 
      subtraction images were valuable for both the demonstration and differentiation 
      of benign and malignant lesions. Additional to these sequences, T2-weighted 
      images was also valuable for benign lesions (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Chemical shift 
      subtraction can contribute to routine dynamic contrast subtraction in morphologic 
      analysis particularly for the evaluation of margins of benign lesions in fatty 
      breasts. It can also help in morphologic analysis of masses in dense breast.
