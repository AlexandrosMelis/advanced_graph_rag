TI  - Is the international normalised ratio (INR) reliable? A trial of comparative 
      measurements in hospital laboratory and primary care settings.
PG  - 494-7
AB  - AIM: To determine the reliability of international normalised ratio (INR) 
      measurement in primary care by practice nurses using near patient testing (NPT), 
      in comparison with results obtained within hospital laboratories by varied 
      methods. METHODS: As part of an MRC funded study into primary care oral 
      anticoagulation management, INR measurements obtained in general practice were 
      validated against values on the same samples obtained in hospital laboratories. A 
      prospective comparative trial was undertaken between three hospital laboratories 
      and nine general practices. All patients attending general practice based 
      anticoagulant clinics had parallel INR estimations performed in general practice 
      and in a hospital laboratory. RESULTS: 405 tests were performed. Comparison 
      between results obtained in the practices and those in the reference hospital 
      laboratory (gold standard), which used the same method of testing for INR, showed 
      a correlation coefficient of 0.96. Correlation coefficients comparing the results 
      with the various standard laboratory techniques ranged from 0.86 to 0.92. It was 
      estimated that up to 53% of tests would have resulted in clinically significant 
      differences (change in warfarin dose) depending upon the site and method of 
      testing. The practice derived results showed a positive bias ranging from 0.28 to 
      1.55, depending upon the site and method of testing. CONCLUSIONS: No technical 
      problems associated with INR testing within primary care were uncovered. 
      Discrepant INR results are as problematic in hospital settings as they are in 
      primary care. These data highlight the failings of the INR to standardise when 
      different techniques and reagents are used, an issue which needs to be resolved. 
      For primary care to become more involved in therapeutic oral anticoagulation 
      monitoring, close links are needed between hospital laboratories and practices, 
      particularly with regard to training and quality assurance.
