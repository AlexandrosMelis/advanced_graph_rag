TI  - Does vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia have the same evolution as cervical 
      intraepithelial neoplasia?
PG  - 371-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia is a little known disease which 
      could be related to risk factors different from simple HPV infections. OBJECTIVE: 
      To ascertain wheter vaginal lesions have a natural history similar to cervical 
      lesions. MATERIALS & METHODS: A retrospective study to identify patients with 
      vaginal lesions and synchronous cervical lesions through biopsy. The rate of mild 
      cervical lesions (koilocytosis, warts, CIN I with and without koilocytosis) was 
      compared with the rate of severe cervical lesions (CIN II and III, cervical 
      carcinoma) in patients with mild vaginal lesions (warts and koilocytosis, and 
      low-grade VAIN) and in patients with severe vaginal lesions (high-grade VAIN). 
      Using koilocytosis as a marker, the rate of "active" cervical lesions was 
      compared with the rate of "non active" cervical lesions in patients with "active" 
      versus "non active" vaginal lesions. Finally, the rates of mild and severe 
      cervical lesions were compared among each group of VAIN (low-grade, high-grade, 
      with or without koilocytosis). RESULTS: In patients with mild vaginal lesions, 
      mild cervical lesions were significantly more frequent than severe cervical 
      lesions. In patients with "active" vaginal lesions the rate of "active" cervical 
      lesions was significantly higher than "non active" cervical lesions. The 
      differences in rates of mild cervical lesions and severe cervical lesions among 
      patients with high-grade VAIN and low-grade VAIN (with and without koilocytosis) 
      were not significant. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that CIN and VAIN may have 
      some common features in certain cases, i.e., if an HPV infection is proved.
