TI  - Does laparoscopic antireflux surgery improve quality of life in patients whose 
      gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is well controlled with medical therapy?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Both medical therapy and laparoscopic antireflux surgery have been 
      shown to improve quality of life in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Although 
      patients with poor symptom control or side effects on medical therapy might be 
      expected to have improved quality of life after surgery, our aim was to 
      determine, for the first time, whether patients whose symptoms are well 
      controlled on medical therapy but who decide to undergo surgery (patient 
      preference) would experience improved quality of life. METHODS: Retrospective 
      analysis of our patient database (1998-2003, n=313) identified 60 patients who 
      underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery for the indication of patient 
      preference. Two generic quality-of-life questionnaires (Short Form 36 and 
      Psychological General Well-Being index) and a gastrointestinal symptom 
      questionnaire (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale) were completed 
      preoperatively, while on medical therapy, and 6 months after surgery. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-eight patients completed all three questionnaires at both time intervals: 
      31 males, seven females; mean age 42 (15-66) years. Preoperative scores while on 
      medical therapy were significantly improved after surgery: Short Form 36 median 
      physical composite scores 52.0 and 54.0 (P=0.034) and mental composite scores 
      51.0 and 56.0 (P=0.020); Psychological General Well-Being median total scores 
      78.0 and 90.0 (P=0.0001); Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale median total 
      scores 2.13 and 1.73 (P=0.0007) and reflux scores 2.50 and 1.00 (P<0.0001). 
      CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic antireflux surgery significantly improved quality of 
      life in reflux patients whose symptoms were well controlled on medical therapy. 
      Although on the basis of a noncomparative trial with a relatively short follow-up 
      period, we believe such patients should be considered for laparoscopic antireflux 
      surgery.
