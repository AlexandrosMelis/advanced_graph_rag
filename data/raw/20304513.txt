AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been reported as a surrogate tracer to 
      measure tumor hypoxia with positron emission tomography (PET). The hypothesis is 
      that there is an increased uptake of FDG under hypoxic conditions secondary to 
      enhanced glycolysis, compensating the hypoxia-induced loss of cellular energy 
      production. Several studies have already addressed this issue, some with 
      conflicting results. This study aimed to compare the tracers (14)C-EF3 and 
      (18)F-FDG to detect hypoxia in mouse tumor models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: C3H, 
      tumor-bearing mice (FSAII and SCCVII tumors) were injected iv with (14)C-EF3, and 
      1h later with (18)F-FDG. Using a specifically designed immobilization device with 
      fiducial markers, PET (Mosaic(R), Philips) images were acquired 1h after the FDG 
      injection. After imaging, the device containing mouse was frozen, transversally 
      sliced and imaged with autoradiography (AR) (FLA-5100, Fujifilm) to obtain high 
      resolution images of the (18)F-FDG distribution within the tumor area. After a 
      48-h delay allowing for (18)F decay a second AR was performed to image (14)C-EF3 
      distribution. AR images were aligned to reconstruct the full 3D tumor volume, and 
      were compared with the PET images. Image segmentation with threshold-based 
      methods was applied on both AR and PET images to derive various tracer activity 
      volumes. The matching index DSI (dice similarity index) was then computed. The 
      comparison was performed under normoxic (ambient air, FSAII: n=4, SCCVII, n=5) 
      and under hypoxic conditions (10% O(2) breathing, SCCVII: n=4). RESULTS: On AR, 
      under both ambient air and hypoxic conditions, there was a decreasing similarity 
      between (14)C-EF3 and FDG with higher activity sub-volumes. Under normoxic 
      conditions, when comparing the 10% of tumor voxels with the highest (18)F-FDG or 
      (14)C-EF3 activity, a DSI of 0.24 and 0.20 was found for FSAII and SCCVII, 
      respectively. Under hypoxic conditions, a DSI of 0.36 was observed for SCCVII 
      tumors. When comparing the (14)C-EF3 distribution in AR with the corresponding 
      (18)F-FDG-PET images, the DSI reached values of 0.26, 0.22 and 0.21 for FSAII and 
      SCCVII under normoxia and SCCVII under hypoxia, respectively. CONCLUSION: This 
      study showed that FDG is not a good surrogate tracer for tumor hypoxia under 
      either ambient or hypoxic conditions. Only specific hypoxia tracers should be 
      used to measure tumor hypoxia.
