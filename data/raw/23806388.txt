TI  - Do nomograms designed to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) do a better job of 
      predicting more clinically relevant prostate cancer outcomes than BCR? A report

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ability of various postoperative nomograms to predict 
      prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and to validate that they could predict 
      aggressive biochemical recurrence (BCR). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), grade, 
      and stage are the classic triad used to predict BCR after radical prostatectomy 
      (RP). Multiple nomograms use these to predict risk of BCR. A previous study 
      showed that several nomograms could predict aggressive BCR (prostate-specific 
      antigen doubling time [PSADT] <9 months) more accurately than BCR. However, it 
      remains unknown if they can predict more definitive endpoints, such as PCSM. 
      METHODS: We performed Cox analyses to examine the ability of 4 postoperative 
      nomograms, the Duke Prostate Center (DPC) nomogram, the Kattan postoperative 
      nomogram, the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) nomogram, and the joint Center for 
      Prostate Disease Research(CPDR)/Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic 
      Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) nomogram to predict BCR and PCSM among 1778 men in 
      the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) database who underwent 
      RP between 1990 and 2009. We also compared their ability to predict BCR and 
      aggressive BCR in a subset of men. We calculated the c-index for each nomogram to 
      determine its predictive accuracy for estimating actual outcomes. RESULTS: We 
      found that each nomogram could predict aggressive BCR and PCSM in a statistically 
      significant manner and that they all predicted PCSM more accurately than they 
      predicted BCR (ie, with higher c-index values). CONCLUSION: Currently available 
      nomograms used to predict BCR accurately predict PCSM and other more clinically 
      relevant endpoints. Moreover, not only do they significantly predict PCSM, but do 
      so with generally greater accuracy than BCR.
