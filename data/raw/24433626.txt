AB  - INTRODUCTION: Medicare beneficiaries who have chronic conditions are responsible 
      for a disproportionate share of Medicare fee-for-service expenditures. The 
      objective of this study was to analyze the change in the health of Medicare 
      beneficiaries enrolled in Part A (hospital insurance) between 2008 and 2010 by 
      comparing the prevalence of 11 chronic conditions. METHODS: We conducted 
      descriptive analyses using the 2008 and 2010 Chronic Conditions Public Use Files, 
      which are newly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and 
      have administrative (claims) data on 100% of the Medicare fee-for-service 
      population. We examined the data by age, sex, and dual eligibility (eligibility 
      for both Medicare and Medicaid). RESULTS: Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more 
      chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008. The percentage increase in 
      the average number of chronic conditions was larger for dual-eligible 
      beneficiaries (2.8%) than for nondual-eligible beneficiaries (1.2%). The 
      prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic 
      heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration 
      of average health was due to other chronic conditions: chronic kidney disease, 
      depression, diabetes, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis. Trends 
      in Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed 
      differences by sex or dual eligibility or both. CONCLUSION: Analyzing the 
      prevalence of 11 chronic conditions by using Medicare claims data provides a 
      monitoring tool that can guide health care providers and policy makers in 
      devising strategies to address chronic conditions and rising health care costs.
