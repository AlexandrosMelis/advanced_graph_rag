TI  - Are higher rates of depression in women accounted for by differential symptom 
      reporting?
PG  - 126-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The gender difference in prevalence and incidence rates of depression 
      is one of the most consistent findings in psychiatric epidemiology. We sought to 
      examine whether any gender differences in symptom profile might account for this 
      difference in rates. METHOD: This study was a population-based 13-year follow-up 
      survey of community-dwelling adults living in East Baltimore in 1981. Subjects 
      were the continuing participants of the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area 
      Program. Participants interviewed between 1993 and 1996 with complete data on 
      depressive symptoms and covariates were included (n = 1727). We applied 
      structural equations with a measurement model for dichotomous data (the 
      MIMIC-multiple indicators, multiple causes-model) to compare symptoms between 
      women and men, in relation to the nine symptom groups comprising the diagnostic 
      criteria for major depression, adjusting for several potentially influential 
      characteristics (namely, age, self-reported ethnicity, educational attainment, 
      marital status, and employment). RESULTS: There were no significant gender 
      differences in the self-report of depression symptoms even taking into account 
      the higher level of depressive symptoms of women and the influence of other 
      covariates. For example, women were no more likely to endorse sadness than were 
      men, as evidenced by a direct effect coefficient that was not significantly 
      different from the null [adjusted estimated direct effect of gender on report of 
      sadness = 0.105, 95% confidence interval (-0.113, 0.323)]. CONCLUSIONS: Men and 
      women in this community sample reported similar patterns of depressive symptoms. 
      No evidence that the presentation of depressive symptoms differs by gender was 
      found.
