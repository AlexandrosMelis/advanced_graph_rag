AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Studies examining predictors of survival among the 
      oldest-old have primarily focused on objective measures, such as physical 
      function and health status. Only a few studies have examined the effect of 
      personality traits on survival, such as optimism. The aim of this study was to 
      examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old. 
      METHODS: The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey 
      comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total 
      of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey. The 
      baseline in-person interview consisted of a comprehensive questionnaire including 
      physical functioning and health, and a question about whether the respondent had 
      an optimistic, neutral or pessimistic outlook on his or her own future. RESULTS: 
      During the follow-up period of 12 years (1998-2010) there were 2,239 deaths (99 
      %) in the 1905 Cohort Survey. Univariable analyses revealed that optimistic women 
      and men were at lower risk of death compared to their neutral counterparts [HR 
      0.82, 95 % CI (0.73-0.93) and 0.81, 95 % CI (0.66-0.99), respectively]. When 
      confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and 
      disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival 
      weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were 
      still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI 
      (0.74-0.97)]. The risk of death was also decreased for optimistic men compared to 
      their neutral counterparts, but the effect was non-significant [HR 0.91, 95 % CI 
      (0.73-1.13)]. CONCLUSION: An optimistic outlook appears to be a significant 
      predictor of survival among the oldest-old women. It may also be a significant 
      predictor for men but the sample size is small.
