AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to explore patients' views on the 
      acceptability and feasibility of using colour to describe osteoarthritis (OA) 
      pain, and whether colour could be used to communicate pain to healthcare 
      professionals. METHODS: Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with 
      knee OA. Discussion topics included first impressions about using colour to 
      describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how 
      colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether 
      they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals. 
      RESULTS: The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using colour 
      was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing 
      their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity 
      pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and 
      the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence 
      of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional 
      feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen 
      to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified 
      as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was 
      described using a wider selection of colours. The majority of participants 
      thought that they would be able to use colour to describe their pain to 
      healthcare professionals, although issues around the interpretability and 
      standardization of colour were raised. CONCLUSIONS: For some patients, using 
      colour to describe their pain experience may be a useful tool to improve 
      doctor-patient communication.
