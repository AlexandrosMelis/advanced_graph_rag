AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cerebral hemispherectomy, a surgical procedure undergone to control 
      intractable seizures, is becoming a standard procedure with more cases identified 
      and treated early in life [33]. While the effect of the dominant hemisphere 
      resection on spoken language has been extensively researched, little is known 
      about reading abilities in individuals after left-sided resection. 
      Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., 
      grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1]. These skills are critical for the 
      acquisition of word-specific orthographic knowledge and have been shown to 
      predict reading levels in average readers as well as in readers with mild 
      cognitive disability [26]. Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been 
      implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the 
      reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy. 
      METHODS: Seven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to 
      control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been 
      recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing 
      that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, 
      i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of 
      vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated 
      by the right hemisphere [2]. RESULTS: We found that about 60% of our group 
      developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range. 
      Phonological processing measured by both phonological awareness and nonword 
      reading was unexpectedly spared in the majority of participants. Phonological 
      awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading. Verbal memory, a 
      component of phonological processing skills, together with receptive vocabulary 
      size, positively correlated with reading levels similar to those reported in 
      average readers. Receptive vocabulary, a bilateral function, was preserved to a 
      certain degree similar to that of strongly left-lateralized phonological skills 
      [3]. Later seizure onset was associated with better reading levels. CONCLUSIONS: 
      When cerebral hemispherectomy is performed to control seizures associated with 
      very early (in utero) insult, it has been found that the remaining right 
      hemisphere is still able to support reading and phonological processing skills 
      that are normally mediated by the left hemisphere. Our results also suggest the 
      existence of variability in individuals after hemispherectomy, even within groups 
      having the same etiology and similar timing of insult.
