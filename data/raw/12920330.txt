TI  - Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?
PG  - 261-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests substantial comorbidity between symptoms of 
      somatization and depression in clinical as well as nonclinical populations. 
      However, as most existing research has been retrospective or cross-sectional in 
      design, very little is known about the specific nature of this relationship. In 
      particular, it is unclear whether somatic complaints may heighten the risk for 
      the subsequent development of depressive symptoms. METHODS: We report findings on 
      the link between symptoms of somatization (assessed using the SCL-90-R) and 
      depression 5 years later (assessed using the CES-D) in an initially healthy 
      cohort of community adults, based on prospective data from the RENO Diet-Heart 
      Study. RESULTS: Gender-stratified multiple regression analyses revealed that 
      baseline CES-D scores were the best predictors of subsequent depressive symptoms 
      for men and women. Baseline scores on the SCL-90-R somatization subscale 
      significantly predicted subsequent self-reported symptoms of depressed mood 5 
      years later, but only in women. However, somatic complaints were a somewhat less 
      powerful predictor than income and age. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that 
      somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, 
      risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in 
      nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including 
      social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting 
      additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.
