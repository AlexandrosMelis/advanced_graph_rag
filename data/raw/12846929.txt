TI  - Quality of life in lung cancer patients: does socioeconomic status matter?
PG  - 19
AB  - BACKGROUND: As part of a prospective study on quality of life in newly diagnosed 
      lung cancer patients an investigation was carried out to examine whether there 
      were differences among patients' quality of life scores and their socioeconomic 
      status. METHODS: Quality of life was measured at two points in time (baseline and 
      three months after initial treatment) using three standard instruments; the 
      Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), the European Organization for Research and 
      Cancer Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its lung 
      cancer supplement (QLQ-LC13). Socioeconomic status for each individual patient 
      was derived using Carstairs and Morris Deprivation Category ranging from 1 (least 
      deprived) to 7 (most deprived) on the basis of the postcode sector of their 
      address. RESULTS: In all, 129 lung cancer patients entered into the study. Of 
      these data for 82 patients were complete (at baseline and follow-up). 57% of 
      patients were of lower socioeconomic status and they had more health problems, 
      less functioning, and more symptoms as compared to affluent patients. Of these, 
      physical mobility (P = 0.05), energy (P = 0.01), role functioning (P = 0.04), 
      physical functioning (P = 0.03), and breathlessness (P = 0.02) were significant 
      at baseline. However, at follow-up assessment there was no significant difference 
      between patient groups nor did any consistent pattern emerge. CONCLUSION: At 
      baseline assessment patients of lower socioeconomic status showed lower health 
      related quality of life. Since there was no clear trend at follow-up assessment 
      this suggests that patients from different socioeconomic status responded to 
      treatment similarly. In general, the findings suggest that quality of life is not 
      only the outcome of the disease and its treatment, but is also highly dependent 
      on each patients' socioeconomic characteristics.
