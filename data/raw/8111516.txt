AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether volunteer family physician reports of the 
      frequency of influenza-like illness (ILI) usefully supplement information from 
      other influenza surveillance systems conducted by the Centers for Disease Control 
      and Prevention. DESIGN: Evaluation of physician reports from five influenza 
      surveillance seasons (1987-88 through 1991-92). SETTING: Family physician office 
      practices in all regions of the United States. PARTICIPANTS: An average of 140 
      physicians during each of five influenza seasons. INTERVENTIONS: None. OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: An office visit or hospitalization of a patient for ILI, defined as 
      presence of fever (temperature > or = 37.8 degrees C) and cough, sore throat, or 
      myalgia, along with the physician's clinical judgment of influenza. A subset of 
      physicians collected specimens for confirmation of influenza virus by culture. 
      RESULTS: Physicians attributed 81,408 (5%) of 1,672,542 office visits to ILI; 
      2754 (3%) patients with ILI were hospitalized. Persons 65 years of age and older 
      accounted for 11% of visits for ILI and 43% of hospitalizations for ILI. In three 
      of five seasons, physicians obtained influenza virus isolates from a greater 
      proportion of specimens compared with those processed by World Health 
      Organization laboratories (36% vs 12%). Influenza virus isolates from sentinel 
      physicians peaked from 1 to 4 weeks earlier than those reported by World Health 
      Organization laboratories. Physicians reported peak morbidity 1 to 4 weeks 
      earlier than state and territorial health departments in four of five seasons and 
      2 to 5 weeks earlier than peak mortality reported by 121 cities during seasons 
      with excess mortality associated with pneumonia and influenza. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Family physicians provide sensitive, timely, and accurate community influenza 
      morbidity data that complement data from other surveillance systems. This 
      information enables monitoring of the type, timing, and intensity of influenza 
      activity and can help health care workers implement prevention or control 
      measures.
