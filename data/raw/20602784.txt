TI  - Identification of racial disparities in breast cancer mortality: does scale 
      matter?

AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper investigates the impact of geographic scale (census tract, 
      zip code, and county) on the detection of disparities in breast cancer mortality 
      among three ethnic groups in Texas (period 1995-2005). Racial disparities were 
      quantified using both relative (RR) and absolute (RD) statistics that account for 
      the population size and correct for unreliable rates typically observed for 
      minority groups and smaller geographic units. Results were then correlated with 
      socio-economic status measured by the percentage of habitants living below the 
      poverty level. RESULTS: African-American and Hispanic women generally experience 
      higher mortality than White non-Hispanics, and these differences are especially 
      significant in the southeast metropolitan areas and southwest border of Texas. 
      The proportion and location of significant racial disparities however changed 
      depending on the type of statistic (RR versus RD) and the geographic level. The 
      largest proportion of significant results was observed for the RD statistic and 
      census tract data. Geographic regions with significant racial disparities for 
      African-Americans and Hispanics frequently had a poverty rate above 10.00%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study investigates both relative and absolute racial 
      disparities in breast cancer mortality between White non-Hispanic and 
      African-American/Hispanic women at the census tract, zip code and county levels. 
      Analysis at the census tract level generally led to a larger proportion of 
      geographical units experiencing significantly higher mortality rates for minority 
      groups, although results varied depending on the use of the relative versus 
      absolute statistics. Additional research is needed before general conclusions can 
      be formulated regarding the choice of optimal geographic regions for the 
      detection of racial disparities.
