TI  - Neoadjuvant Imatinib in Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal stromal Tumours, Will 
      Kit Mutation Analysis Be a Pathfinder?
PG  - 381-388
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Longer duration of neoadjuvant (NA) imatinib (IM) used for locally 
      advanced (LA) gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) is not based on biology of 
      the tumour reflected by kit mutation analysis. MATERIAL AND METHODS: LA or 
      locally recurrent (LR) GIST treated with NA IM from May 2008 to March 2015 from a 
      prospective database were included in the analysis. Archived formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) were used for testing KIT exons 9, 11, 13 and 17 
      by PCR. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five patients with LA or LR GIST were treated 
      with NA IM. Forty-five patients (36 %) had undergone c-kit mutation testing. Exon 
      11 was seen in 25 patients (55.5 %), 3 with exon 9 (6.7 %) and 2 with exon 13 
      (4.4 %). Twelve were wild type (26.6 %) and  3 (6.7 %) were declared 
      uninterpretable. Response rate (RR) for the exon 11 mutants was higher than the 
      non-exon 11 mutant group (84 vs. 40 %, p = 0.01). Disease stabilization rate 
      (DSR) rates were also higher in the exon 11 subgroup than non-exon 11 group (92 
      vs. 75 %). Eighty-four per cent exon 11 and 75 % non-exon 11 mutants were 
      surgical candidates. Patients undergoing surgery had significantly improved event 
      free survival (EFS) (p < 0.001) compared to patients not undergoing surgery, with 
      the same trend seen in OS (p = 0.021). Patients with a SD on response to NA IM 
      had a lower EFS (p = 0.076) and OS compared to patients achieving CR/PR. There 
      were no differences between the various exon variants in terms of outcomes and 
      responses CONCLUSION: Upfront evaluation of kit mutation status may help us in 
      delineating separate treatment strategies for potentially biologically different 
      tumours and assessing the correct timing of surgery for this subset of GIST.
