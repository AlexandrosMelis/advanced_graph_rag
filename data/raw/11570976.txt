TI  - Is it Crohn's disease? A severe systemic granulomatous reaction to sulfasalazine 
      in patient with rheumatoid arthritis.
PG  - 8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sulfasalazine is a widely used anti-inflammatory agent in the 
      treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and several rheumatological disorders. 
      Although as many as 20% of treated patients may experience reversible, 
      dose-dependent side effects, less frequent but potentially severe, systemic 
      reactions have also been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A severe systemic reaction 
      to sulfasalazine developed in a 21-year old female with rheumatoid arthritis 
      characterized by eosinophilia, granulomatous enteritis and myelotoxicity, 
      cholestatic hepatitis, and seizures. The clinical course and management of this 
      patient are presented as well as a review of the incidence and outcome of severe 
      systemic reactions to sulfasalazine. CONCLUSIONS: Granulomatous myelotoxicity and 
      enteritis developed in a 21 year old female within 3 weeks of initiating 
      sulfasalazine for rheumatoid arthritis. Following a short course of 
      corticosteroids, the patient had resolution of her cholestatic hepatitis, rash, 
      eosinophilia, and gastrointestinal symptoms with no residual manifestations at 7 
      months follow-up. Although severe reactions to sulfasalazine are rare and 
      unpredictable, practicing physicians should be aware of unusual clinical 
      presentations of toxicity when prescribing sulfasalazine.
