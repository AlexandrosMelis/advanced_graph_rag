AB  - BACKGROUND: Schools can play an important role in the prevention of obesity, e.g. 
      by providing an environment that stimulates healthy eating habits and by 
      developing a food policy to provide such an environment. The effectiveness of a 
      school food policy is affected by the content of the policy, its implementation 
      and its support by parents, teachers and principals. The aim of this study is to 
      detect opportunities to improve the school food policy and/or implementation at 
      Dutch primary schools. Therefore, this study explores the school food policy and 
      investigates schools' (teachers and principals) and parents' opinion on the 
      school food policy. METHODS: Data on the schools' perspective of the food policy 
      was collected from principals and teachers by means of semi-structured 
      interviews. In total 74 principals and 72 teachers from 83 Dutch primary schools 
      were interviewed. Data on parental perceptions about the school food policy were 
      based on a cross-sectional survey among 1,429 parents from the same schools. 
      RESULTS: Most principals (87.1%) reported that their school had a written food 
      policy; however in most cases the rules were not clearly defined. Most of the 
      principals (87.8%) believed that their school paid sufficient attention to 
      nutrition and health. Teachers and principals felt that parents were primarily 
      responsible to encourage healthy eating habits among children, while 49.8% of the 
      parents believed that it is also a responsibility of the school to foster healthy 
      eating habits among children. Most parents reported that they appreciated the 
      school food policy and comply with the food rules. Parents' opinion on the 
      enforcement of the school food policy varied: 28.1% believed that the school 
      should enforce the policy more strongly, 32.1% was satisfied, and 39.8% had no 
      opinion on this topic. CONCLUSION: Dutch primary schools could play a more 
      important role in fostering healthy eating habits among children. The school food 
      policy could be improved by clearly formulating food rules, simplifying 
      supervision of the food rules, and defining how to enforce the food rules. In 
      addition, the school food policy will only influence children's dietary behaviour 
      if both the school and the parents support the policy.
