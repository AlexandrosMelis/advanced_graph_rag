AB  - SETTING: Medical units at an academic tertiary referral hospital in Southern 
      India. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of solid culture on Lowenstein-Jensen 
      medium on clinical decision making. DESIGN: In a retrospective review of 150 
      culture-positive and 150 culture-negative consecutively sampled tuberculosis (TB) 
      suspects, treatment decisions were analysed at presentation, after the 
      availability of culture detection results and after the availability of drug 
      susceptibility testing (DST) culture results. RESULTS: A total of 124 (82.7%) 
      culture-positive patients and 35 (23.3%) culture-negative patients started 
      anti-tuberculosis treatment prior to receiving their culture results; 101 
      patients (33.7%) returned for their results; two (1.3%) initiated treatment based 
      on positive culture and no culture-negative patients discontinued treatment. DST 
      was performed on 119 (79.3%) positive cultures: 30 (25.2%) showed any resistance, 
      eight (6.7%) showed multidrug resistance and one (0.84%) showed extensively 
      drug-resistant TB. Twenty-eight patients (23.5%) returned for their DST results. 
      Based on DST, treatment was modified in four patients (3.4%). CONCLUSION: Using 
      solid culture, 150 cultures need to be tested for one treatment modification and 
      30 for DST. The cost of the widespread application of culture will need to be 
      balanced against its impact on treatment decisions in India.
