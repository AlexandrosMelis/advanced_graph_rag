TI  - Do patients with rheumatoid arthritis established on methotrexate and folic acid 
      5 mg daily need to continue folic acid supplements long term?
PG  - 1102-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is postulated that some aspects of methotrexate toxicity may be 
      related to its action as an anti-folate. Folic acid (FA) is often given as an 
      adjunct to methotrexate therapy, but there is no conclusive proof that it 
      decreases the toxicity of methotrexate and there is a theoretical risk that it 
      may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate. OBJECTIVES: To look at the effect of 
      stopping FA supplementation in UK rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients established 
      on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily, to report all toxicity 
      (including absolute changes in haematological and liver enzyme indices) and to 
      report changes in the efficacy of methotrexate. METHODS: In a prospective, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 75 patients who were 
      established on methotrexate <20 mg weekly and FA 5 mg daily were asked to stop 
      their FA and were randomized to one of two groups: placebo or FA 5 mg daily. 
      Patients were evaluated for treatment toxicity and efficacy before entry and then 
      at intervals of 3 months for 1 yr. RESULTS: Overall, 25 (33%) patients concluded 
      the study early, eight (21%) in the group remaining on FA and 17 (46%) in the 
      placebo group (P = 0.02). Two patients in the placebo group discontinued because 
      of neutropenia. At 9 months there was an increased incidence of nausea in the 
      placebo group (45 vs. 7%, P = 0.001). The placebo group had significantly lower 
      disease activity on a few of the variables measured, but these were probably not 
      of clinical significance. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to continue FA 
      supplementation over the long term in patients on methotrexate and FA in order to 
      prevent them discontinuing treatment because of mouth ulcers or nausea and 
      vomiting. Our data suggest that FA supplementation is also helpful in preventing 
      neutropenia, with very little loss of efficacy of methotrexate.
