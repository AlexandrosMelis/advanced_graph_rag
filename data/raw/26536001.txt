TI  - Is There an Additional Value of Using Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 2a 
      Immunohistochemistry Compared to Somatostatin Receptor Scintigraphy Uptake in 
      Predicting Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Response?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: It is unknown whether tumoral somatostatin receptor subtype 
      2a (sst2a) immunohistochemistry (IHC) has additional value compared to 
      somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) uptake using OctreoScan(R) in predicting 
      response to peptide receptor radiotherapy using 177Lu-octreotate (PRRT) in 
      patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). The aims 
      of this study were: (1) to establish the percentage of sst2a immunopositivity in 
      GEP-NET samples of PRRT-treated patients, (2) to determine the relationship 
      between best GEP-NET response using RECIST 1.0 criteria 1 year after PRRT and 
      tumoral sst2a IHC, and (3) to compare characteristics of patients with sst2a 
      IHC-negative and -positive tumors. METHODS: All 73 consecutive patients were 
      selected for PRRT based on a positive SRS. Radiological response was scored 
      according to RECIST 1.0 criteria. sst2a status was detected on tumor samples by 
      IHC. RESULTS: In total, 93% of GEP-NET samples showed sst2a IHC positivity. No 
      statistically significant relationship was observed between in vitro sst2a 
      expression and in vivo best GEP-NET response 1 year after PRRT (p = 0.47). Sex, 
      primary tumor site, disease stage, ENETS TNM classification, Ki-67 index, highest 
      serum chromogranin-A level, and highest neuron-specific enolase level were not 
      significantly different between patients with negative and positive sst2a tumoral 
      IHC with the exception of age at diagnosis (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: sst2a IHC of 
      tumor samples has no additional value compared to SRS uptake using OctreoScan(R) in 
      predicting tumor response after PRRT.
