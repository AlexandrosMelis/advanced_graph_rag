TI  - Learning needs of postpartum women: does socioeconomic status matter?
PG  - 86-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about how information needs change over time in the 
      early postpartum period or about how these needs might differ given socioeconomic 
      circumstances. This study's aim was to examine women's concerns at the time of 
      hospital discharge and unmet learning needs as self-identified at 4 weeks after 
      discharge. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a cross-sectional survey of 
      postpartum health outcomes, service use, and costs of care in the first 4 weeks 
      after postpartum hospital discharge. Recruitment of 250 women was conducted from 
      each of 5 hospitals in Ontario, Canada (n = 1,250). Women who had given vaginal 
      birth to a single live infant, and who were being discharged at the same time as 
      their infant, assuming care of their infant, competent to give consent, and able 
      to communicate in one of the study languages were eligible. Participants 
      completed a self-report questionnaire in hospital; 890 (71.2%) took part in a 
      structured telephone interview 4 weeks after hospital discharge. RESULTS: 
      Approximately 17 percent of participants were of low socioeconomic status. 
      Breastfeeding and signs of infant illness were the most frequently identified 
      concerns by women, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Signs of infant 
      illness and infant care/behavior were the main unmet learning needs. Although few 
      differences in identified concerns were evident, women of low socioeconomic 
      status were significantly more likely to report unmet learning needs related to 9 
      of 10 topics compared with women of higher socioeconomic status. For most topics, 
      significantly more women of both groups identified learning needs 4 weeks after 
      discharge compared with the number who identified corresponding concerns while in 
      hospital. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to ensure that new mothers are adequately 
      informed about topics important to them while in hospital. The findings highlight 
      the need for accessible and appropriate community-based information resources for 
      women in the postpartum period, especially for those of low socioeconomic status.
