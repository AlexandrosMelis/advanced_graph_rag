TI  - Are octogenarians at high risk for carotid endarterectomy?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several prospective randomized trials have proved carotid 
      endarterectomy to be safe and effective for both symptomatic and asymptomatic 
      patients younger than 80 years of age. Recently, carotid artery stenting (CAS) 
      has been approved for use in selected high-risk patients. It has been proposed 
      that being an octogenarian places patients in this high-risk category. STUDY 
      DESIGN: All patients between the ages of 80 to 89 years undergoing carotid 
      endarterectomy during a 12-year period were included in the study. Information 
      included indications for carotid endarterectomy, associated risk factors, length 
      of stay, and hospital course. Perioperative morbidity and mortality, including 
      neurologic events and myocardial infarction, were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 
      103 carotid endarterectomies were performed in 95 octogenarians. Procedures were 
      performed on 59 men and 36 women. Indications for operation included symptomatic 
      carotid stenosis in 44 patients (43%) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis in 59 
      (57%). Associated risk factors included diabetes mellitus (17%), hypertension 
      (76%), coronary artery disease (28%), hyperlipidemia (39%), and history of 
      smoking (42%). There were 4 perioperative neurologic complications, which 
      included 1 transient ischemic attack (0.97%), 2 minor strokes (1.94%), and 1 
      major stroke (0.97%). There were no deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Combined end points for 
      adverse events are acceptable in the octogenarian. Carotid endarterectomy remains 
      the gold standard for treatment of extracranial carotid disease in all age 
      groups. Age alone should not place patients in the high-risk category for carotid 
      endarterectomy.
