AB  - PURPOSE: The mode of delivery depends on multiple parameters. After assisted 
      reproductive technology (ART), previous studies have shown elevated C-section 
      rates but few studies differentiated between elective and emergency operations 
      and different protocols of cryopreservation. Because these studies did not use 
      multiparity as exclusion criteria which reduces confounding with previous 
      pregnancies, aim of this study is to compare mode of delivery of different 
      techniques of ART using data of primiparae only [1, 2]. METHODS: Retrospective 
      analysis of patient data treated at the university hospital of Luebeck in a 
      period of 12 years. Patients were divided in different groups according to their 
      way of conception: spontaneous conception and conception after ART. The group of 
      ART was further divided into: (a) a group of fresh transferred embryos 
      (IVF/ICSI), (b) vitrification and (c) slow freezing. Exclusion criteria were 
      defined as: multiparity, delivery <24. + 0 p.m., incomplete data and treatment 
      outside university of Luebeck. Main parameter of this study was mode of delivery 
      which was divided into spontaneous delivery or C-section. C-sections were further 
      differentiated into elective or emergency C-sections. RESULTS: The group of fresh 
      transferred embryos and slow freezing showed higher risks for elective and 
      emergency C-sections (elective C-sections odds ratio 2.0, CI 95% 1.6-2.6, 
      emergency C-sections odds ratio 1.4, CI 95% 1.1-1.9). Moreover, all groups of ART 
      show enhanced risk of significant perinatal bleeding. CONCLUSION: Patients after 
      ART treatment suffer from higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery.
