TI  - Thrombosis prophylaxis in hospitalised medical patients: does prophylaxis in all 
      patients make sense?
PG  - 171-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most studies on thrombosis prophylaxis focus on postoperative venous 
      thrombosis. In medical wards thrombosis prophylaxis is generally restricted to 
      patients who are immobilised. Our primary aim was to investigate the incidence of 
      venous thrombosis in a general internal ward, to assess whether more rigorous 
      prophylaxis would be feasible. METHODS: We investigated the incidence of venous 
      thrombosis in patients hospitalised from 1992 to 1996 and related our findings to 
      literature reports. RESULTS: The incidence of symptomatic venous thrombosis in 
      internal patients during hospitalisation was 39/6332 (0.6%). Among these 39 
      patients, 24 had a malignancy, whereas 876 out of all 6332 patients had a known 
      malignancy. So, the incidence in this group with cancer was 2.7% compared with 
      0.3% (15/5456) in the non-cancer group (relative risk for venous thrombosis due 
      to malignancy was 10.0 (95%C.I. 5.3-18.9). CONCLUSION: The incidence of venous 
      thrombosis during hospitalisation in a department of general internal medicine is 
      low and does not justify prophylaxis in all internal patients. Cancer is a strong 
      risk factor for hospital-acquired thrombosis in the medical ward. Further studies 
      may answer the question as to whether thrombosis prophylaxis in this subgroup is 
      feasible.
