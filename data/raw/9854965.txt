AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and nature of global cognitive 
      dysfunction and language deficits in an unselected population based cohort of 
      patients with motor neuron disease (MND). METHODS: A battery of 
      neuropsychological and language tests was administered to patients presenting 
      consecutively over a 3 year period to a regional neurology service with a new 
      diagnosis of sporadic motor neuron disease. RESULTS: The 18 patients could be 
      divided on the basis of their performance into three groups: Three patients were 
      demented and had impaired language function (group 1); two non-demented patients 
      had an aphasic syndrome characterised by word finding difficulties and anomia 
      (group 2). Major cognitive deficits were therefore found in five of the 18 
      patients (28%). The remaining 13 performed normally on the test battery apart 
      from decreased verbal fluency (group 3). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of cognitive 
      impairment in MND in this population based study of an unselected cohort was 
      higher than has been previously reported. Language deficits, especially anomia, 
      may be relatively frequent in the MND population. Aphasia in MND may be masked by 
      dysarthria and missed if not specifically examined.
