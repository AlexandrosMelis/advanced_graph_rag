AB  - AIM: To determine the frequency and presenting features of infants with delayed 
      diagnosis of anorectal malformations (ARM) referred to an Australian tertiary 
      paediatric institution. METHODS: Infants referred to our institution with a final 
      diagnosis of ARM were retrospectively reviewed between 2001 and 2009. The first 
      cohort consisted of patients that were referred between November 2001 and 
      November 2006 with the diagnosis of an ARM that had been delayed for more than 48 
      h. The second cohort was those referred between December 2006 and May 2009 with 
      whom the diagnosis of ARM had not been made within 24 h of birth. RESULTS: 
      Nineteen infants were referred with delayed diagnosis of an ARM over the 7.5 
      years of the study. Of 44 patients referred to our institution between December 
      2006 and May 2009, diagnosis of an ARM was delayed more than 24 h in 14 (32%). 
      There was no difference in gender, birth weight, prematurity, type of 
      malformation or presence of associated anomalies between those with timely and 
      delayed diagnosis of their ARM. A significantly greater proportion of those with 
      a delayed diagnosis presented with obstructive symptoms (86% vs. 27%, P < 0.001), 
      including abdominal distension (57%) and delayed passage of meconium or stool 
      (29%). Despite undergoing neonatal examination, the diagnosis of ARM was missed 
      in 12 patients overall. CONCLUSION: Delayed diagnosis of an ARM appears to be 
      common, occurring in approximately 32% of patients referred to our institution 
      over the last 2.5 years. Current guidelines appear insufficient to ensure prompt 
      diagnosis of ARM.
