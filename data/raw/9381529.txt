TI  - Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses 
      to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist?
PG  - 1055-65
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using murine models, we have shown that the lysosomotropic amine, 
      chloroquine, is effective in the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 
      mediated by donor T cells reactive with recipient minor histocompatibility 
      antigens (MiHCs). Because lysosomotropic amines can suppress major 
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation, their mechanism 
      of action is potentially different from current immune suppressant drugs used to 
      control GVHD such as cyclosporine. METHODS: We investigated the use of 
      cyclosporine and the lysosomotropic amines chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in 
      combination for additive or synergistic immunosuppression on T-cell responses in 
      vitro to MiHC and MHC in mice. RESULTS: We found that similar concentrations of 
      chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress the T-cell response to MiHC in mice 
      (C57BL/6 anti-BALB.B) and that lysosomotropic amines in combination with 
      cyclosporine result in synergistic suppression of a proliferative response to 
      MiHC. Similar suppression and synergy appear to be present in an alloreactive 
      response (C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c). Direct inhibition by chloroquine of T-cell 
      proliferative responses induced by anti-CD3epsilon in the absence of 
      antigen-presenting cells is present at higher concentrations than that required 
      to suppress responses to MiHC or MHC. Chloroquine appears to induce decreased 
      T-cell viability at high concentrations. This effect does not appear to be due to 
      decreased T-cell production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma. At lower 
      concentrations (<25 microg/ml), chloroquine can also decrease the ability of 
      antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an a C57BL/6 anti-BALB/c T-cell response 
      and can inhibit MHC class II expression after activation with lipopolysaccharide. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Lysosomotropic amines in combination with cyclosporine appear to be 
      synergistic in the suppression of T-cell proliferation to MiHC and MHC. Use of 
      chloroquine in combination with cyclosporine may result in improved control of 
      GVHD.
