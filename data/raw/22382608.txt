AB  - OBJECTIVES: The differential diagnosis between essential tremor (ET) and 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) may be, in some cases, very difficult on clinical 
      grounds alone. In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients 
      presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical 
      pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, 
      N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called 
      FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to 
      be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm 
      dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is 
      to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them 
      from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data 
      in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones 
      of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD 
      diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs. 
      METHODS: Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 
      28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 
      patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with 
      unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were 
      included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and 
      measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the 
      caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals. RESULTS: Qualitative 
      (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the 
      uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and 
      ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in 
      the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant 
      differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. 
      There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left 
      putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients 
      with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right 
      putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET 
      at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical 
      presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of 
      them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an 
      equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12 months later. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results do not support the hypothesis of a link between essential tremor and 
      Parkinson's disease. However, it appears that ET patients have a small degree of 
      striatal dopaminergic degeneration. If this is due to alterations in the 
      nigrostriatl pathway or of other origin it is not clear. Follow-up studies of 
      essential tremor patients are warranted to assess progression of disease and to 
      understand better the possible cause for striatal dopaminergic degeneration.
