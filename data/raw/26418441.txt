AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyps identified at colonoscopy are predominantly diminutive (<5 mm) 
      with a small risk (>1%) of high-grade dysplasia or carcinoma; however, the cost 
      of histological assessment is substantial. AIM: The aim of this study was to 
      determine whether prediction of colonoscopy surveillance intervals based on 
      real-time endoscopic assessment of polyp histology is accurate and cost 
      effective. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted across a tertiary 
      care and private community hospital. Ninety-four patients underwent colonoscopy 
      and polypectomy of diminutive (</=5 mm) polyps from October 2012 to July 2013, 
      yielding a total of 159 polyps. Polyps were examined and classified according to 
      the Sano-Emura classification system. The endoscopic assessment (optical 
      diagnosis) of polyp histology was used to predict appropriate colonoscopy 
      surveillance intervals. The main outcome measure was the accuracy of optical 
      diagnosis of diminutive colonic polyps against the gold standard of histological 
      assessment. RESULTS: Optical diagnosis was correct in 105/108 (97.2%) adenomas. 
      This yielded a sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive 
      values (with 95%CI) of 97.2% (92.1-99.4%), 78.4% (64.7-88.7%), 90.5% (83.7-95.2%) 
      and 93% (80.9-98.5%) respectively. Ninety-two (98%) patients were correctly 
      triaged to their repeat surveillance colonoscopy. Based on these findings, a cut 
      and discard approach would have resulted in a saving of $319.77 per patient. 
      CONCLUSION: Endoscopists within a tertiary care setting can accurately predict 
      diminutive polyp histology and confer an appropriate surveillance interval with 
      an associated financial benefit to the healthcare system. However, limitations to 
      its application in the community setting exist, which may improve with further 
      training and high-definition colonoscopes.
