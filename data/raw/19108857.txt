AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis continues to be a public health problem in emerging 
      countries with a recent evidence of increased incidence of extrapulmonary 
      localization in developed countries probably linked to HIV. To our knowledge the 
      occurrence of cerebro-mediastinal tuberculosis in an immuno-competent child has 
      not been previously described; moreover the child we describe has a probable 
      Say-Barber-Miller syndrome. We discuss a putative causative link between this 
      syndrome and the occurrence of tuberculosis. CASE REPORT: A seven-year-old girl 
      presented to our department with a history of infantile encephalopathy since 
      birth characterized by a facial dysmorphy (evocative of a bird face), 
      microcephaly, and mental retardation, and with recurrent infections. The child 
      had complained of back pain for several months; the parents reported anorexia, 
      loss of weight. Spinal and cerebral MRI showed a mediastinal mass involving the 
      spine and cerebral lesions evocative of tuberculomas. The tuberculin interdermal 
      reaction was positive. Culture of a vertebral biopsy was positive for Koch 
      bacillus. Anti-tuberculosis treatment improved general and local status. An 
      extensive immunological work-up was normal. CONCLUSION: [corrected] This 
      observation is exceptional in many aspects: very early age of onset of 
      extrapulmonary tuberculosis, no immune deficit, association with a rare 
      congenital neurological syndrome. We discuss the possible link between this 
      entity and the occurrence of tuberculosis.
