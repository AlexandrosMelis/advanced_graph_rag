      Forces? A pilot study.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Figures from the British Defence Dental Services reveal that 
      serving personnel in the British Army have a persistently lower level of dental 
      fitness than those in the Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force. No research had been 
      undertaken to ascertain if this reflects the oral health of recruits joining each 
      Service. This study aimed to pilot a process for collecting dental and 
      sociodemographic data from new recruits to each Service and examine the null 
      hypothesis that no differences in dental health existed. METHOD: Diagnostic 
      criteria were developed, a sample size calculated and data collected at the 
      initial training establishments of each Service. RESULTS: Data for 432 
      participants were entered into the analysis. Recruits in the Army sample had a 
      significantly greater prevalence of dental decay and greater treatment resource 
      need than either of the other two Services. Army recruits had a mean number of 
      2.59 (2.08, 3.09) decayed teeth per recruit, compared to 1.93 (1.49, 2.39 p 
      <0.01) in Royal Navy recruits and 1.26 (0.98, 1.53 p <0.001) in Royal Air Force 
      recruits. Among Army recruits 62.7% were from the two most deprived quintiles of 
      the Index of Multiple Deprivation compared to 42.5% of Royal Naval recruits and 
      36.6% of Royal Air Force recruits. CONCLUSION: A significant difference in dental 
      health between recruits to each Service does exist and is a likely to be a 
      reflection of the sociodemographic background from which they are drawn.
