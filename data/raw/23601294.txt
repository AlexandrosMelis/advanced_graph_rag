AB  - INTRODUCTION: Evaluate the capability of different Computed Tomography scanners 
      to determine urinary stone compositions based on CT attenuation values and to 
      evaluate potential differences between each model. METHODS: 241 human urinary 
      stones were obtained and their biochemical composition determined. Four different 
      CT scanners (Siemens, Philips, GEMS and Toshiba) were evaluated. Mean 
      CT-attenuation values and the standard deviation were recorded separately and 
      compared with a t-paired test. RESULTS: For all tested CT scanners, when the 
      classification of the various types of stones was arranged according to the mean 
      CT-attenuation values and to the confidence interval, large overlappings between 
      stone types were highlighted. The t-paired test showed that most stone types 
      could not be identified. Some types of stones presented mean CT attenuation 
      values significantly different from one CT scanner to another. At 80kV, the mean 
      CT attenuation values obtained with the Toshiba Aquilion were significantly 
      different from those obtained with the Siemens Sensation. On the other hand, mean 
      values obtained with the Philips Brilliance were all significantly equal to those 
      obtained with the Siemens Sensation and with the Toshiba Aquilion. At 120kV mean 
      CT attenuation values of uric acid, cystine and struvite stones obtained with the 
      Philips model are significantly different from those obtained with the Siemens 
      and the Toshiba but equal to those obtained with the GE 64. CONCLUSIONS: 
      According to our study, there is a great variability when different brands and 
      models of scanners are compared directly. Furthermore, the CT scan analysis and 
      HU evaluation appears to gather insufficient information in order to characterize 
      and identify the composition of renal stones.
