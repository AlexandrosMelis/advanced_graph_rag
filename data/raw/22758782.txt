      patients with hip fracture: does it decrease morbidity, mortality, and health

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hip fracture in geriatric patients has a substantial economic 
      impact and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in this 
      population. At our institution, a regional anesthesia program was instituted for 
      patients undergoing surgery for hip fracture. This retrospective cohort review 
      examines the effects of regional anesthesia (from mainly after July 2007) vs 
      general anesthesia (mainly prior to July 2007) on morbidity, mortality and 
      hospitalization costs. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study involved data 
      collection from electronic and paper charts of 308 patients who underwent surgery 
      for hip fracture from September 2006 to December 2008. Data on postoperative 
      morbidity, in-patient mortality, and cost of hospitalization (as estimated from 
      data on hospital charges) were collected and analyzed. Seventy-three patients 
      received regional anesthesia and 235 patients received general anesthesia. During 
      July 2007, approximately halfway through the study period, a regional anesthesia 
      and analgesia program was introduced. RESULTS: The average cost of 
      hospitalization in patients who received surgery for hip fracture was no 
      different between patients who receive regional or general anesthesia ($16,789 + 
      631 vs $16,815 + 643, respectively, P = 0.9557). Delay in surgery and intensive 
      care unit (ICU) admission resulted in significantly higher hospitalization costs. 
      Age, male gender, African American race and ICU admission were associated with 
      increased in-hospital mortality. In-hospital mortality and rates of readmission 
      are not statistically different between the two anesthesia groups. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is no difference in postoperative morbidity, rates of rehospitalization, 
      in-patient mortality or hospitalization costs in geriatric patients undergoing 
      regional or general anesthesia for repair of hip fracture. Delay in surgery 
      beyond 3 days and ICU admission both increase cost of hospitalization.
