TI  - Is there a relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease?
PG  - 267-72
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether there is a relationship 
      between disease experience of rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease. 
      METHODS: 1,412 individuals attending the University of Queensland's School of 
      Dentistry were assessed for the prevalence of periodontal disease and rheumatoid 
      arthritis. Analysis of data obtained from a self-reported health questionnaire 
      and dental records was carried out and included: number of individuals referred 
      for advanced periodontal care (test group); number of individuals attending for 
      routine dentistry; determination of rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular disease 
      and diabetes mellitus through self-reporting and assessment of prescription 
      medications; assessment of periodontal disease through assessment of existing 
      oral radiographs. RESULTS: In patients referred for periodontal treatment, the 
      prevalence of self-reported rheumatoid arthritis was 3.95% which is significantly 
      higher than that seen in patients not referred for periodontal treatment (0.66%) 
      and also that reported in the general population (1%). Of those referred patients 
      with rheumatoid arthritis, 62.5% had advanced forms of periodontal disease. These 
      results were mirrored in the results of the self-reported prevalence of 
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus which was consistent with the 
      published higher prevalence in periodontal patients. CONCLUSIONS: Based on data 
      derived from self-reported health conditions, and not withstanding the 
      limitations of such a study, we conclude that there is good evidence to suggest 
      that individuals with moderate to severe periodontal disease are at higher risk 
      of suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and vice versa.
