TI  - Cholesterol screening in school children: is family history reliable to choose 
      the ones to screen?
PG  - 1794-8
AB  - AIM: Hyperlipidemia is a major factor accompanying atherosclerosis. As the basis 
      of atherosclerotic heart disease begins at early childhood, we aim to find out 
      which children should be tested for hypercholesterolemia, what the high 
      cholesterol level in children is and what cautions should be taken to avoid 
      atherosclerosis. METHODS: The study was carried on 2096 school children (1043 
      male, 1053 female) in Ankara. Their mean age was 9.03 years. Demographic 
      properties of the study group and their families were determined and the serum 
      lipid levels of the subjects were obtained. The relation between these 
      demographic properties and lipid levels were investigated. RESULTS: In 135 of the 
      subjects' serum cholesterol level was >or=200 mg/dL and in 83 subjects serum 
      LDL-cholesterol level was >or=130 mg/dL. Despite 64.4% of the subjects reported a 
      family history of hyperlipidemia, no relations between family history and serum 
      lipid levels were found. CONCLUSION: We suggest that regardless of family 
      history, all children over 5 years should be screened for hyperlipidemia. 
      Education about hyperlipidemia and precautions for its complications should be 
      given to both children and families. The best and easiest way to reach children 
      is to screen them at schools. School is also a good place for education of 
      children about hyperlipidemia and risk factors.
