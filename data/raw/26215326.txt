AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine whether risk of recurrent 
      preterm birth differs based on the clinical presentation of a prior spontaneous 
      preterm birth (SPTB): advanced cervical dilatation (ACD), preterm premature 
      rupture of membranes (PPROM), or preterm labor (PTL). STUDY DESIGN: This 
      retrospective cohort study included singleton pregnancies from 2009 to 2014 
      complicated by a history of prior SPTB. Women were categorized based on the 
      clinical presentation of their prior preterm delivery as having ACD, PPROM, or 
      PTL. Risks for sonographic short cervical length and recurrent SPTB were compared 
      between women based on the clinical presentation of their prior preterm birth. 
      Log-linear regression was used to control for confounders. RESULTS: Of 522 
      patients included in this study, 96 (18.4%) had prior ACD, 246 (47.1%) had prior 
      PPROM, and 180 (34.5%) had prior PTL. Recurrent PTB occurred in 55.2% of patients 
      with a history of ACD compared with 27.2% of those with PPROM and 32.2% with PTL 
      (P = .001). The mean gestational age at delivery was significantly lower for 
      those with a history of ACD (34.0 weeks) compared with women with prior PPROM 
      (37.2 weeks) or PTL (37.0 weeks) (P = .001). The lowest mean cervical length 
      prior to 24 weeks was significantly shorter in patients with a history of 
      advanced cervical dilation when compared with the other clinical presentations. 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with a history of ACD are at an increased risk of having 
      recurrent preterm birth and cervical shortening in a subsequent pregnancy 
      compared with women with prior preterm birth associated PPROM or PTL.
