TI  - Are behavioural risk factors to be blamed for the conversion from optimal blood 
      pressure to hypertensive status in Black South Africans? A 5-year prospective 
      study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Longitudinal cohort studies in sub-Saharan Africa are urgently needed 
      to understand cardiovascular disease development. We, therefore, explored health 
      behaviours and conventional risk factors of African individuals with optimal 
      blood pressure (BP) (</= 120/80 mm Hg), and their 5-year prediction for the 
      development of hypertension. METHODS: The Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology 
      study in the North West Province, South Africa, started in 2005 and included 
      African volunteers (n = 1994; aged > 30 years) from a sample of 6000 randomly 
      selected households in rural and urban areas. RESULTS: At baseline, 48% of the 
      participants were hypertensive (>/= 140/90 mmHg). Those with optimal BP (n = 478) 
      were followed at a success rate of 70% for 5 years (213 normotensive, 68 
      hypertensive, 57 deceased). Africans that became hypertensive smoked more than 
      the normotensive individuals (68.2% vs 49.8%), and they also had a greater waist 
      circumference [ratio of geometric means of 0.94 cm (95% CI: 0.86-0.99)] and 
      greater amount of gamma-glutamyltransferase [0.74 U/l (95% CI: 0.62-0.88)] at 
      baseline. The 5-year change in BP was independently explained by baseline 
      gamma-glutamyltransferase [R(2) = 0.23, beta = 0.13 U/l (95% CI: 0.01-0.19)]. Alcohol 
      intake also predicted central systolic BP and carotid cross-sectional wall area 
      (CSWA) at follow-up. Waist circumference was another predictor of BP changes [beta = 
      0.18 cm (95% CI: 0.05-0.24)] and CSWA. HIV infection was inversely associated 
      with increased BP. CONCLUSIONS: During the 5 years, 24% of Africans with optimal 
      BP developed hypertension. The surge in hypertension in Africa is largely 
      explained by modifiable risk factors. Public health strategies should focus 
      aggressively on lifestyle to prevent a catastrophic burden on the national health 
      system.
