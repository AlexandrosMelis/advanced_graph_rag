TI  - Acute hepatitis C in Israel: a predominantly iatrogenic disease?
PG  - 158-64
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute hepatitis C virus infection in the era of universal 
      screening of blood products has not disappeared, and is thought to be transmitted 
      primarily via injecting drug use. A growing body of evidence supports iatrogenic 
      transmission as an important mode of transmission. The aim of this study was to 
      examine transmission routes and clinical characteristics in a group of patients 
      with acute hepatitis C in Israel. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was 
      conducted in three different liver clinics in Israel, of all new hepatitis C 
      patients. Patients identified as possible acute hepatitis C were re-interviewed 
      and all other sources such as blood bank records and pre-employment check-ups 
      reviewed in order to establish the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C infection and 
      to identify the transmission route. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were found to 
      have acute hepatitis C, representing 0.75% of all new referrals for hepatitis C. 
      The most frequent (65%) mode of transmission was iatrogenic involving several, 
      often minimal, procedures and clinical settings. The group in which iatrogenic 
      transmission was suspected was older and the patients more often in monogamous 
      relationship compared with other transmission routes groups. Injecting drug use 
      was the second most common route of infection. Spontaneous seroconversion has 
      occurred in approximately one third of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Acute hepatitis 
      C in the post universal blood products screening era was found to be 
      predominantly an iatrogenic disease in the investigated localities. This finding 
      should direct attention and resources towards the development and implementation 
      of preventive measures.
