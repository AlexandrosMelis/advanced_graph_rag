TI  - Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis--is it the same disease as adult ankylosing 
      spondylitis?
PG  - 94-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Juvenile and adult forms of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) have been 
      shown to have different clinical presentation and outcome in Caucasians. We did 
      this retrospective analysis to see if similar differences exist in the Indian 
      population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case records of 210 Indian patients diagnosed 
      with AS according to modified New York criteria were reviewed. Data were 
      collected regarding age of onset, clinical features, drug treatment, and outcome 
      at last follow-up. Patients with onset before 17 years of age were classified as 
      having juvenile AS (JAS) and the rest with adult AS (AAS). RESULTS: There were 
      150 patients with AAS and 60 with JAS. The latter had higher male preponderance, 
      more frequent onset with peripheral arthritis, and greater involvement of hip and 
      knee joints. Valvular dysfunction was seen only in patients with JAS. CONCLUSION: 
      In this group of subjects, juvenile AS had onset more often with oligoarthritis 
      and enthesitis than with spinal disease. Hip and knee joint involvement was more 
      common in JAS than AAS.
