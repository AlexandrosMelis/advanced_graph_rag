TI  - Treatment as prevention in resource-limited settings: is it feasible to maintain 
      HIV viral load suppression over time?

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, there has been increasing interest in the role of 
      "treatment as prevention" (TasP). Some of the questions regarding TasP strategies 
      arise from the perceived difficulties in achieving and maintaining viral load 
      (VL) suppression over time and the risk of emergence of viral resistance that 
      could compromise future treatment options. This study was conducted to assess 
      these questions in a resource-limited setting. METHODOLOGY: We performed a 
      retrospective observational study of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the 
      pre-HAART era on follow-up at a private center from Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
      Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from clinical 
      charts. Analyses were performed to test for potential associations of selected 
      variables with current virologic failure or use of third-line drugs. RESULTS: Of 
      619 patients on follow-up, 82 (13.2%) were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. At the 
      time of our study, 79 (96.3%) patients were on HAART, with a median duration of 
      14 years (IQR 12-15) of therapy, and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse 
      transcriptase inhibitors regimens in 47.8% of cases. Sixty-nine patients (87.3%) 
      had undetectable VL, 37 (46.8%) never presented virologic failure, and 19 (24.1%) 
      experienced only one failure. Thirteen patients (16.5%) were receiving third-line 
      ART regimens, with an average of 2.7-fold more virologic failures than those on 
      first- or second-line regimens (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining viral load 
      suppression over time in resource-limited-settings is feasible.
