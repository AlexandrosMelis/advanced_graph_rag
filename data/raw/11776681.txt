TI  - Is intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation an effective predictor of fetal 
      acidosis?
PG  - 506-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis of this prospective study is that intrapartum 
      vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis 
      during labor. Various clinical conditions, such as term versus preterm gestation, 
      first stage versus second stage of labor, and fetal heart rate (FHR) variable 
      decelerations versus late decelerations will be tested. METHODS: During the study 
      period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first 
      stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected 
      from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late 
      decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and 
      FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH 
      was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to 
      VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two 
      tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the 
      predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where 
      appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p < 0.05 was considered statistically 
      different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for 
      statistical analyses. RESULTS: Excellent association between acceleration 
      response to VAS and pH > or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no 
      acceleration or decelerations) and pH < 7.20 were found in the first stage of 
      labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p 
      = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for 
      predicting fetal acidosis (pH < 7.20) were comparable between term (> or = 37 
      weeks) and preterm (< 37 weeks, > or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm 
      fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw 
      adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 
      67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the 
      false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was 
      significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). 
      Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH < 7.20) have equal 
      predictability for neonatal morbidity. The PPV of NICU admission by a negative 
      VAS response was two times higher than that of fetal acidosis (PPV = 61% vs 29%, 
      p = 0.038). CONCLUSION: We found that intrapartum VAS was an effective predictor 
      of fetal acidosis in cases of FHR variable decelerations, but its predictability 
      for fetal acidosis in cases of FHR late decelerations was limited. Both VAS and 
      fetal blood pH are good predictors of neonatal morbidity.
