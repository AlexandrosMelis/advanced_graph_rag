TI  - Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA 
      for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of acetabular fractures in osteoporotic patients is 
      increasing. Immediate total hip arthroplasty (THA) has potential advantages, but 
      achieving acetabular component stability is challenging and, at early followup, 
      reported revision rates for loosening are high. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: This study 
      measured acetabular component stability and the initial surface contact achieved 
      between the acetabular component and unfractured region of the pelvis after THA 
      using an oversized acetabular component and cup-cage reconstruction. METHODS: 
      Between November 2011 and November 2013, we treated 40 acute acetabular fractures 
      in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these, 12 (30%) underwent immediate 
      THA using an oversized acetabular component with screws inserted only into the 
      ilium and a cup-cage construct. Postoperatively all patients were mobilized 
      without weightbearing restrictions. Indications for immediate THA after 
      acetabular fractures were displaced articular comminution deemed unreducible. 
      Eleven of the 12 were prospectively studied to evaluate the initial stability of 
      the reconstructions using radiostereometric analysis. One of the patients died of 
      a pulmonary embolism after surgery, and the remaining 10 (median age, 81 years; 
      range, 72-86 years) were studied. Of these, five were analyzed at 1 year and five 
      were analyzed at 2 years. Acetabular component migration was defined as 
      acceptable if less than the limits for primary THA that predict later loosening 
      (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53 degrees  of sagittal rotation). The contact 
      surface between the acetabular component and ilium in direct continuity with the 
      sacroiliac joint, and the ischium and pubis in direct continuity with the 
      symphysis pubis, was measured on postoperative CT scans. RESULTS: At 1 year the 
      median proximal migration was 0.83 mm (range, 0.09-5.13 mm) and sagittal rotation 
      was 1.3 degrees  (range, 0.1 degrees -7.4 degrees ). Three of the 10 components had migration above the 
      suggested limits for primary THA at 1 year postoperatively. The contact surface 
      achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 
      17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of acetabular 
      components in this cohort were stable despite the small contact surface achieved 
      between the component and pelvic bone. Three of 10 migrated in excess of the 
      limits that predict later loosening in primary THA but it remains to be seen 
      whether these limits apply to this selected group of frail osteoporotic patients. 
      We continue to use this technique routinely to treat patients with the same 
      indications, but since the analysis of these data we have added screw fixation of 
      the acetabular component to the ischial tuberosity and the superior pubic ramus. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.
