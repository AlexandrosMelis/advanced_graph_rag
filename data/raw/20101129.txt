      contralateral fragility hip fracture?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: : A previous hip fracture more than doubles the risk of a 
      contralateral hip fracture. Pharmacologic and environmental interventions to 
      prevent hip fracture have documented poor compliance. The purpose of this study 
      was to examine the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation of the uninjured 
      hip to prevent contralateral hip fracture. METHODS: : A Markov state-transition 
      model was used to evaluate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for 
      unilateral fixation of hip fracture alone (including internal fixation or 
      arthroplasty) compared with unilateral fixation and contralateral prophylactic 
      hip fixation performed at the time of hip fracture or unilateral fixation and 
      bilateral hip pad protection. Prophylactic fixation involved placement of a 
      cephalomedullary nail in the uninjured hip and was initially assumed to have a 
      relative risk of a contralateral fracture of 1%. Health states included good 
      health, surgery-related complications requiring a second operation (infection, 
      osteonecrosis, nonunion, and malunion), fracture of the uninjured hip, and death. 
      The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio 
      estimated as cost per QALY gained in 2006 US dollars with incremental 
      cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 per QALY gained considered 
      cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of patient age, annual 
      mortality and complication rates, intervention effectiveness, utilities, and 
      costs on the value of prophylactic fixation. RESULTS: : In the baseline analysis, 
      in a 79-year-old woman, prophylactic fixation was not found to be cost-effective 
      (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $142,795/QALY). However, prophylactic 
      fixation was found to be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip 
      fracture in: 1) women 71 to 75 years old who had 30% greater relative risk for a 
      contralateral fracture; and 2) women younger than age 70 years. 
      Cost-effectiveness was greater when the additional costs of prophylaxis were less 
      than $6000. However, for most analyses, the success of prophylactic fixation was 
      highly sensitive to the effectiveness and the relative morbidity and mortality of 
      the additional procedure. CONCLUSION: : Prophylactic fixation with a 
      cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older 
      woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select 
      patient populations. The study supports the need for basic science and clinical 
      trials investigating the effectiveness of prophylactic fixation for patient 
      populations at higher lifetime risk for contralateral hip fracture.
