TI  - Does open access endoscopy close the door to an adequately informed patient?
PG  - 212-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of open access endoscopy is increasing. Its effect on the 
      adequacy of patient informed consent, procedure acceptance and the impact on 
      subsequent communication/transfer of procedure results to the patient have not 
      been evaluated. The aim of our study was to compare the extent of preknowledge of 
      procedures and test explanation, patient medical complexity, information transfer 
      and overall patient satisfaction between a patient group referred for outpatient 
      open access endoscopy versus a patient group from a gastrointestinal (GI) 
      subspecialty clinic. METHODS: Information was obtained from all patients 
      presenting for outpatient upper and lower endoscopy by using a 1-page 
      questionnaire. Patients from the two groups who had an outpatient upper/lower 
      endoscopic procedure were contacted by phone after the procedure to obtain 
      information with a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: The open access patients 
      reported receiving significantly less information to help them identify the 
      procedure (p < 0.01) and less explanation concerning the nature of the procedure 
      than the group of patients referred from the subspecialty clinic (p < 0.005). 
      There was no difference between the two groups in satisfaction scores for 
      examinations performed under conscious sedation. For flexible sigmoidoscopy 
      without sedation, however, the GI clinic patient group were more satisfied with 
      their procedure. The majority of patients, regardless of access, were more likely 
      to receive endoscopic results from a gastroenterologist than the referring 
      physician. Furthermore, the patients in the GI clinic group who underwent 
      colonoscopy felt significantly better at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Patients 
      undergoing open access procedures are less likely to be properly informed about 
      their endoscopic procedure. Our results indicate that with open access endoscopy, 
      a defined mechanism needs to be in place for communication of endoscopic results 
      to the patient.
