AB  - BACKGROUND: Vancomycin is the primary treatment for infections caused by 
      methicilin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The association of vancomycin 
      treatment failures with increased vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration 
      (MIC) is a well-recognized problem. A number of single-centre studies have 
      identified progressive increases in glycopeptide MICs for S. aureus strains over 
      recent years - a phenomenon known as vancomycin MIC creep. It is unknown if this 
      is a worldwide phenomenon or if it is localized to specific centers. METHODS: The 
      aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of vancomycin MIC for isolates of 
      MRSA over a 3-year period in a tertiary university hospital in Portugal. MRSA 
      isolates from samples of patients admitted from January 2007 to December 2009 
      were assessed. Etest method was used to determine the respective vancomycin MIC. 
      Only one isolate per patient was included in the final analysis. RESULTS: A total 
      of 93 MRSA isolates were studied. The vancomycin MICs were 0.75, 1, 1.5 and 2 
      mg/L for 1 (1.1%), 19 (20.4%), 38 (40.9%), 35 (37.6%) isolates, respectively. 
      During the 3 year period, we observed a significant fluctuation in the rate of 
      MRSA with a vancomycin MIC > 1 mg/L (2007: 86.2%; 2008: 93.3%; 2009: 58.8%, 
      p = 0.002). No MRSA isolate presented a MIC > 2 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable 
      to find in our institution data compatible to the presence of vancomycin MIC 
      creep during the study period. This phenomenon seems not to be generalized; as a 
      result each institution should systematically monitor MRSA vancomycin MIC over 
      time.
