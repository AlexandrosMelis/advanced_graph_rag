AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a 
      patient-safety curriculum administered during a paediatric clerkship on medical 
      students' attitudes towards patient safety. METHODS: Medical students viewed an 
      online video introducing them to systems-based analyses of medical errors. 
      Faculty presented an example of a medication administration error and 
      demonstrated use of the Learning From Defects tool to investigate the defect. 
      Student groups identified and then analysed medication errors during their 
      clinical rotation using the Learning From Defects framework to organise and 
      present their findings. Outcomes included patient safety attitudinal changes, as 
      measured by questions derived from the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. RESULTS: 
      108 students completed the curriculum between July 2008 and July 2009. All 
      student groups (25 total) identified, analysed and presented patient safety 
      concerns. Curriculum effectiveness was demonstrated by significant changes on 
      questionnaire items related to patient safety attitudes. The majority of students 
      felt that the curriculum was relevant to their clinical rotation and should 
      remain part of the clerkship. CONCLUSIONS: An active learning curriculum 
      integrated into a clinical clerkship can change learners' attitudes towards 
      patient safety. Students found the curriculum relevant and recommended its 
      continuation.
