TI  - Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis 
      the key to eliminating these symptoms?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are an effective treatment for 
      postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. However, 
      patients receiving AIs report a higher incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms and 
      bone fractures; the mechanism and risk factors for this correlation are not well 
      studied. The aim of this study was to correlate these musculoskeletal symptoms 
      and bone fractures in patients receiving AIs with bone mineral density (BMD), 
      previous tamoxifen use, and administration of calcium/bisphosphonate (Ca/Bis). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed charts of 856 patients with hormone 
      receptor-positive nonmetastatic breast cancer seen at our institution between 
      January 1999 and October 2007. A total of 316 patients met the inclusion criteria 
      of treatment with one of the AIs for > or = 3 months and availability of a 
      dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) during this treatment. Arthralgia, 
      generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, bone fracture after beginning AIs, any 
      tamoxifen treatment, and Ca/Bis therapy were recorded. RESULTS: Our study 
      demonstrates a significant association between symptoms and DEXA-BMD results (P < 
      .001). Similarly, the group receiving tamoxifen before AIs had fewer patients 
      with arthralgia or generalized bone pain/myalgia or bone fracture (P < .001). 
      Furthermore, the group receiving AIs plus Ca/Bis had more patients without 
      musculoskeletal symptoms and had fewer fractures. Finally, the group receiving 
      steroidal AIs compared with nonsteroidal AIs had more patients with arthralgia or 
      generalized bone pain and/or myalgia, and bone fractures (P < .001). CONCLUSION: 
      Patients on AIs who develop osteoporosis are at increased risk of musculoskeletal 
      symptoms and bone fracture. Comedication with Ca/Bis reduces the likelihood for 
      osteoporosis and musculoskeletal symptoms. Patients who received tamoxifen before 
      AIs were less likely to develop AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms. We recommend 
      that patients on AIs should be offered Ca/Bis to reduce the incidence of 
      musculoskeletal symptoms and fracture, especially if patients are receiving 
      steroidal AI and/or did not receive tamoxifen before AIs.
