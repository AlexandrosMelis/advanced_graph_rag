TI  - Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe?

AB  - PURPOSE: Trauma patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation pose a difficult 
      treatment problem. The purpose of this study was to determine: (1) the incidence 
      of complications using therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients, and (2) if 
      any patient factors are associated with these complications. METHODS: An 18-month 
      retrospective review was performed on trauma patients >or= 15 years old who 
      received therapeutic anticoagulation using unfractionated heparin (UH) and/or 
      fractionated heparin (FH). Forty different pre-treatment and treatment patient 
      characteristics were recorded. Complications of anticoagulation were documented 
      and defined as any unanticipated discontinuation of the anticoagulant for 
      bleeding or other adverse events. RESULTS: One-hundred-fourteen trauma patients 
      were initiated on therapeutic anticoagulation. The most common indication for 
      anticoagulation was deep venous thrombosis (46%). Twenty-four patients (21%) had 
      at least 1 anticoagulation complication. The most common complication was a 
      sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion (11 
      patients). Five patients died (4%), 3 of whom had significant hemorrhage 
      attributed to anticoagulation. Bivariate followed by logistic regression analysis 
      identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 9.2, 95%CI = 1.5-54.7), UH 
      use (OR = 3.8, 95%CI = 1.1-13.0), and lower initial platelet count (OR = 1.004, 
      95%CI = 1.000-1.008) as being associated with complications. Patients receiving 
      UH vs. FH differed in several characteristics including laboratory values and 
      anticoagulation indications. CONCLUSION: Trauma patients have a significant 
      complication rate related to anticoagulation therapy, and predicting which 
      patients will develop a complication remains unclear. Prospective studies are 
      needed to determine which treatment regimen, if any, is appropriate to safely 
      anticoagulate this high risk population.
