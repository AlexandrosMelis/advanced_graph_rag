AB  - BACKGROUND: Although consensus guidelines for pretreatment evaluation and 
      monitoring of propranolol therapy in patients with infantile hemangiomas (IH) 
      have been formulated, little is known about the cardiovascular side effects. 
      OBJECTIVES: We sought to analyze cardiovascular evaluations in patients with IH 
      at baseline and during treatment with an oral beta-blocker. METHODS: Data from 
      109 patients with IH were retrospectively analyzed. Patient and family history, 
      pretreatment electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, and blood pressure were 
      evaluated before initiation of beta-blocker therapy. Blood pressure and 
      standardized questionnaires addressing side effects were evaluated during 
      treatment. RESULTS: Questionnaire analyses (n = 83) identified 3 cases with a 
      family history of cardiovascular disease in first-degree relatives. ECG findings 
      were normal in each case and no serious complication of therapy occurred. ECG 
      abnormalities were found in 6.5% of patients but there were no contraindications 
      to beta-blocker therapy and no major complications. Hypotension in 9 patients did 
      not require therapy adjustment. In all, 88 parents (81%) reported side effects 
      during beta-blocker treatment. LIMITATIONS: The relatively small patient cohort 
      is a limitation. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment ECG is of limited value for patients 
      with an unremarkable cardiovascular history and a normal heart rate and blood 
      pressure. Hypotension may occur during treatment.
