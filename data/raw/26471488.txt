TI  - Does Mammographic Density have an Impact on the Margin Re-excision Rate After 
      Breast-Conserving Surgery?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited and conflicting data exist on an association between 
      mammographic density (MD) and re-excision rates after breast-conserving surgery 
      (BCS). Additionally, the correlation of MD with resection of unnecessary margins 
      during initial BCS is unknown. METHODS: All women with a diagnosis of breast 
      cancer from 2003 to 2012 and enrolled in a larger study on MD were evaluated. 
      Operative and pathology reports were reviewed to determine margin resection and 
      involvement. Mammographic density was determined both by breast imaging-reporting 
      and data system (BI-RADS) classification and by an automated software program 
      (Volpara Solutions). Additional margins were deemed unnecessary if the lumpectomy 
      specimen margin was free of invasive tumor [>/=2 mm for ductal carcinoma in situ 
      (DCIS)] or if further re-excision was needed. RESULTS: Of 655 patients, 398 
      (60.8%) had BCS, whereas 226 (34.5%) underwent initial mastectomy. The women with 
      denser breasts (BI-RADS 3 or 4) underwent initial mastectomy more frequently than 
      the women with less dense breasts (40.0 vs. 30.5%, respectively; p = 0.0118). Of 
      the patients with BCS, 166 (41.7%) required separate re-excision. Additional 
      margins were taken during BCS in 192 (48.2%) patients, with 151 (78.6%) proving 
      to be unnecessary. In the bivariable analysis, the patients with denser breasts 
      according to BI-RADS classification and volumetric density showed a trend toward 
      requiring more frequent re-excision, but this association was not seen in the 
      multivariable analysis. The rate of unnecessary margins did not differ by breast 
      density. In the multivariate analysis, the re-excision rates increased with DCIS 
      (p < 0.0003) and decreased with resection of additional margins (p = 0.0043). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mammographic density is not associated with an increased need for 
      re-excision or resection of unnecessary margins at initial BCS.
