      relationship protective?
PG  - 240-50
LID - 10.1177/1087054712459560 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the extent to which ADHD was associated with risky 
      sexual behaviors (RSBs) in a sample of 92 undergraduates with (n = 44) and 
      without (n = 48) ADHD. Mother-child relationship quality was examined as a 
      potential moderator. METHOD: We conducted comprehensive assessments for ADHD and 
      comorbid conditions and collected measures of RSB and mother-child relationship 
      quality. RESULTS: Female students with ADHD were least likely to use condoms than 
      males overall and females without ADHD. An interaction between ADHD and 
      mother-child relationship quality accounted for significant variance in the 
      number of past-year sexual partners, such that a high-quality relationship was 
      protective only for students with ADHD. No other significant associations were 
      found between ADHD and RSB. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that female college 
      students with ADHD are at risk for unprotected sex. Moreover, a positive 
      mother-child relationship may be protective for college students with ADHD in 
      relation to RSB.
