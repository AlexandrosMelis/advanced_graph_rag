AB  - OBJECTIVES: (1) To describe the prevalence of general practitioner visits and 
      hospitalization according to sex and age groups; (2) to identify which factors 
      are independently associated with a higher use of health care services among 
      elderly Spanish; and (3) to study the time trends in the prevalence of use of 
      health care services 2001-2009. STUDY DESIGN: Observational study. We analyzed 
      data from the Spanish National Health Surveys conducted in 2001 (n=21,058), 2003 
      (n=21,650), 2006 (n=29,478) and 2009 (n=22,188). We included responses from 
      adults aged 65 years and older. OUTCOME MEASURES: The main variables were the 
      number of general practitioner visits in the last 4 weeks and hospitalization in 
      the past year. We stratified the adjusted models by the main variables. We 
      analyzed socio-demographic characteristics, health related variables, using 
      multivariate logistic regression models. RESULTS: The total number of subjects 
      was 24,349 (15,041 woman, 9309 men). Women were significantly older than men 
      (P<0.001). Women had higher prevalence of general practitioner visits than men in 
      all surveys. Men had significantly higher prevalence of hospitalizations than 
      women in the years 2001, 2006 and 2009. When we adjusted the hospitalization by 
      possible confounders using logistic regressions, men had a higher probability of 
      being hospitalized than women (OR 1.53, 1.39-1.69). The variables that were 
      significantly associated with a higher use of health care services were lower 
      educational level, worse self-rated health, chronic conditions, polypharmacy, and 
      the level of disability. The number of general practitioner visits among women 
      and men significantly increased from 2001 to 2009 (women: OR 1.43, 1.27-1.61; 
      men: OR 1.71, 1.49-1.97). CONCLUSIONS: The current study revealed an increase in 
      health care services utilization from 2001 to 2009 in the older Spanish 
      population.
