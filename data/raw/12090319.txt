TI  - Is there a need for pelvic CT scan in cases of renal cell carcinoma?
PG  - 13-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the necessity of pelvic computed tomography (CT) in 
      patients of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the 
      records of 400 patients of RCC, who underwent treatment at our institution 
      between January 1988 and February 2001. These patients were evaluated 
      pre-operatively with ultrasonograms (USG) and contrast enhanced CT scan of the 
      abdomen and pelvis. USG or CT scans of these cases were reviewed for presence of 
      pathology in the pelvis, which were classified into 3 categories viz; benign and 
      likely to be insignificant, benign and likely to be significant; and malignant. 
      RESULTS: Of the 400 cases, 114 were stage I, 68 were stage II, 99 were stage III 
      and 119 were stage IV. In all patients, tumour was identified in the kidney on 
      preoperative CT scan. Fourteen patients (3.5%) had an abnormality on pelvic CT. 
      Five (1.25%) had category 1, three (0.75%) had category 2 and six (1.5%) had 
      category 3 abnormality on pelvic CT. However, all these abnormalities in pelvis 
      were detected prior to CT by other investigations (USG or plain x-ray). Of the 
      six cases with malignant findings, two had superficial bladder cancer, one had 
      RCC in a pelvic kidney and three had bone metastases in the pelvis. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pelvic CT does not offer additional information in the vast majority of cases 
      with RCC and should be performed selectively. Thus the cost of diagnostic imaging 
      in RCC can be reduced.
