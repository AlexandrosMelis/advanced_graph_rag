      team has recommended?

AB  - BACKGROUND: A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach to breast cancer management 
      is the gold standard. The aim is to evaluate MDT decision making in a modern 
      breast unit. METHODS: All referrals to the breast MDT where breast cancer was 
      diagnosed from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 2011 were included. Multidisciplinary team 
      decisions were compared with subsequent patient management and classified as 
      concordant or discordant. RESULTS: Over the study period, there were 3230 MDT 
      decisions relating to 705 patients. Overall, 91.5% (2956 out of 3230) of 
      decisions were concordant, 4.5% (146 out of 3230), were discordant and 4% (128 
      out of 3230) had no MDT decision. Of 146 discordant decisions, 26 (17.8%) were 
      considered 'unjustifiable' as there was no additional information available after 
      the MDT to account for the change in management. The remaining 120 discordant MDT 
      decisions were considered 'justifiable', as management was altered due to patient 
      choice (n=61), additional information available after MDT (n=54) or MDT error 
      (n=5). CONCLUSION: The vast majority of MDT decisions are implemented. Management 
      alteration was most often due to patient choice or additional information 
      available after the MDT. A minority of management alterations were 
      'unjustifiable' and the authors recommend that any patient whose treatment is 
      subsequently changed should have MDT rediscussion prior to treatment.
