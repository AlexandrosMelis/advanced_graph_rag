AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of diffusion-weighted 
      imaging (DWI) in predicting the development of vascularization in hypovascular 
      hepatocellular lesions (HHLs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two HHLs that were 
      diagnosed by computed tomographic (CT) arteriography were evaluated 
      retrospectively. The lesion on DWI was classified as isointense, hypointense, or 
      hyperintense. Follow-up studies that included intravenous dynamic CT or magnetic 
      resonance imaging were performed. RESULTS: The 730-day cumulative developments of 
      vascularization in hypointense, isointense, and hyperintense lesions were 17%, 
      30%, and 40%, respectively. The differences among these developments were not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The signal intensity on DWI showed no 
      significant difference in the development of vascularization.
