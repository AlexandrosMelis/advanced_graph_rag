TI  - Can dentists recognize manipulated digital radiographs?
PG  - 67-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the ability of dentists to recognize digitally 
      manipulated radiographs. METHODS: A poster was presented at the Annual Meeting of 
      the German Society for Periodontology displaying the intra-oral radiographs of 12 
      different patients. Half of the radiographs were subjected to digital 
      manipulation to add or remove specific features. Dentists were asked to identify 
      these radiographs by means of a questionnaire. RESULTS: Thirty-nine dentists 
      submitted usable questionnaires. Statistical evaluation revealed a distribution 
      of hits similar to the random distribution. None of the dentists detected all the 
      six manipulated radiographs; three dentists had five correct, but there were five 
      with only one. An authentic radiograph scored highest as a manipulation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Image manipulations which alter the diagnostic content of a 
      radiograph are unlikely to be detected by dentists. Digital radiography requires 
      additional measures for data protection.
