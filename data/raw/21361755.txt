TI  - Laminoplasty outcomes: is there a difference between patients with degenerative 
      stenosis and those with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament?

AB  - OBJECT: Two common causes of cervical myelopathy include degenerative stenosis 
      and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). It has been 
      postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes 
      than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical 
      results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due 
      to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL. METHODS: The authors conducted 
      a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a 
      single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without 
      kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy 
      ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL 
      group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and 
      number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p > 0.05). The 
      authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic 
      results. RESULTS: The overall clinical follow-up rate was 88%, and the mean 
      clinical follow-up duration was 16.4 months. The mean radiographic follow-up rate 
      was 83%, and the mean length of radiographic follow-up was 9.3 months. There were 
      no significant differences in the estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of 
      hospital stay (LOS) between the groups (p > 0.05). The mean EBL and LOS for the 
      degenerative group were 206 ml and 3.7 days, respectively. The mean EBL and LOS 
      for the OPLL group were 155 ml and 4 days, respectively. There was a 
      statistically significant improvement of more than one grade in the Nurick score 
      for both groups following surgery (p < 0.05). The Nurick score improvement was 
      not statistically different between the groups (p > 0.05). The visual analog 
      scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively 
      (p > 0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between 
      groups either (p > 0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of 
      motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically 
      significant (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CSM due to either degenerative 
      disease or segmental OPLL have similar perioperative results and neurological 
      outcomes with laminoplasty. The VAS neck pain scores did not improve 
      significantly with laminoplasty for either group. Laminoplasty may limit 
      extension ROM.
