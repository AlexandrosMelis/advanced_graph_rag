TI  - Bony defects in chronic anterior posttraumatic dislocation of the shoulder: Is 
      there a correlation between humeral and glenoidal lesions?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of combined humeral and glenoid defects varies between 
      79 and 84 % in case of chronic posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability. The 
      main goal of this study was to evaluate the relationship between humeral and 
      glenoid defects based on quantitative radiological criteria. METHODS: A 
      retrospective study was performed between 2000 and 2011 including patients who 
      underwent primary surgical shoulder stabilization for chronic posttraumatic 
      anterior shoulder instability, with bone defects in both the glenoid and humerus 
      and a healthy contralateral shoulder. The following measurements were taken: D/R 
      ratio (Hill-Sachs lesion depth/humeral head radius) on an AP X-ray in internal 
      rotation and the D1/D2 ratio [diameter of the involved glenoid articular surfaces 
      (D1)/the healthy one (D2)] on a comparative Bernageau glenoid profile view. 
      Measurements were taken by two observers. Correlations were determined by the 
      Spearman correlation coefficients (r), Bland and Altman diagrams, and intra-class 
      correlation coefficients (ICC). A sample size calculation was done. RESULTS: 
      Thirty patients were included, 25 men/5 women, mean age 29.8 +/- 11.2 years. The 
      mean D/R was 23 +/- 12 % for observer 1 and 23 +/- 10 % for observer 2. The mean 
      D1/D2 was 95 +/- 4 % for observer 1 and 94 +/- 6 % for observer 2. No significant 
      correlation was found between humeral and glenoid bone defects by observer 1 
      (r = 0.23, p = 0.22) or observer 2 (r = 0.05, p = 0.78). Agreement of the 
      observers for the D/R ratio was excellent (ICC = 0.89 +/- 0.04, p < 0.00001) and 
      good for the D1/D2 ratio (ICC = 0.54 +/- 0.14, p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Humeral and 
      glenoid bone defects were not correlated. Inter-observer reliability was 
      excellent for the D/R ratio and good for the D1/D2 ratio. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 
      Nonconsecutive Patients, Diagnostic Study, Level III.
