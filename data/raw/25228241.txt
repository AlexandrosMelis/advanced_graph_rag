TI  - Elephant trunk in a small-calibre true lumen for chronic aortic dissection: cause 
      of haemolytic anaemia?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The elephant trunk technique for aortic dissection is useful for 
      reducing false lumen pressure; however, a folded vascular prosthesis inside the 
      aorta can cause haemolysis. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether 
      an elephant trunk in a small-calibre lumen can cause haemolysis. METHODS: 
      Inpatient and outpatient records were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Two 
      cases of haemolytic anaemia after aortic surgery using the elephant trunk 
      technique were identified from 2011 to 2013. A 64-year-old man, who underwent 
      graft replacement of the ascending aorta for acute Stanford type A aortic 
      dissection, presented with enlargement of the chronic dissection of the 
      descending aorta and moderate aortic regurgitation. A two-stage surgery was 
      scheduled. Total arch replacement with an elephant trunk in the true lumen and 
      concomitant aortic valve replacement were performed. Postoperatively, he 
      developed severe haemolytic anaemia because of the folded elephant trunk. The 
      anaemia improved after the second surgery, including graft replacement of the 
      descending aorta. Similarly, a 61-year-old man, who underwent total arch 
      replacement for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection, presented with 
      enlargement of the chronic dissection of the descending aorta. Graft replacement 
      of the descending aorta with an elephant trunk inserted into the true lumen was 
      performed. The patient postoperatively developed haemolytic anaemia because of 
      the folded elephant trunk, which improved after additional stent grafting into 
      the elephant trunk. CONCLUSIONS: A folded elephant trunk in a small-calibre lumen 
      can cause haemolysis. Therefore, inserting an elephant trunk in a small-calibre 
      true lumen during surgery for chronic aortic dissection should be avoided.
