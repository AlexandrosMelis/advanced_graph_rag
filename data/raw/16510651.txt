TI  - Birth characteristics and risk of low intellectual performance in early 
      adulthood: are the associations confounded by socioeconomic factors in 
      adolescence or familial effects?
PG  - 714-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated whether the association between measures 
      of fetal growth restriction and intellectual performance was mediated by 
      socioeconomic or familial factors. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort 
      study of 357,768 Swedish males born as singletons without congenital 
      malformations between 1973 and 1981. The main outcome measure was intellectual 
      performance at military conscription. RESULTS: Compared with men born with 
      appropriate birth weight for gestational age, men born light for gestational age 
      suffered an increased risk of low intellectual performance after adjustment for 
      maternal and socioeconomic factors. The increase in risk of low intellectual 
      performance related to a decrease in birth weight for gestational age was similar 
      between families and within families. Men born short or with a small head 
      circumference for gestational age were also at increased risk of low intellectual 
      performance, both when adjusting for maternal and socioeconomic factors and 
      within families. CONCLUSIONS: We found that all of the studied dimensions of 
      restricted fetal growth are independently associated with increased risks of low 
      intellectual performance and that these associations are only partly mediated by 
      socioeconomic or familial factors.
