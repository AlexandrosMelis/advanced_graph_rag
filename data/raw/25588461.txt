AB  - PURPOSE: Disorders of consciousness (DOC) diagnosis relies on the presence or 
      absence of purposeful motor responsiveness, which characterizes the minimally 
      conscious state (MCS) and the unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS), 
      respectively. Functional neuroimaging studies have raised the question of 
      possible residual conscious awareness also in clinically-defined UWS patients. 
      The aim of our study was to identify electrophysiological parameters, by means of 
      a transcranial magnetic stimulation approach, which might potentially express the 
      presence of residual networks sustaining fragmentary behavioral patterns, even 
      when no conscious behavior can be observed. METHODS: We enrolled 25 severe DOC 
      patients, following post-anoxic or traumatic brain injury and 20 healthy 
      individuals (HC) as control group. Baseline electrophysiological evaluation 
      evidenced, in comparison to HC, a partial preservation of cortical effective 
      connectivity and excitability in clinically defined MCS, whereas these components 
      were absent in clinically defined UWS. Then, we applied an anodal transcranial 
      direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) protocol over the orbitofrontal cortex. 
      RESULT: a-tDCS was able to boost cortical connectivity and excitability in all 
      HC, MCS, and to unmask such excitability/connectivity in some UWS patients. 
      CONCLUSION: a-tDCS could be useful in identifying residual connectivity markers 
      in clinically-defined UWS, who may lack of purposeful behavior as a result of a 
      motor-output failure.
