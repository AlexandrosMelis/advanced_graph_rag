AB  - PURPOSE: The present study aims to evaluate benefit of adding surgery to 
      chemoradiotherapy alone in management of carcinoma esophagus. METHODS: We 
      retrospectively analyzed 45 eligible patients of squamous cell esophageal 
      carcinoma which were enrolled from February 2008 to April 2009. All patients were 
      treated with chemoradiotherapy (50.40 Gy with 40 mg/m(2) of weekly cisplatin). 
      Tumor response was assessed after 6 weeks of treatment. Patients with resectable 
      disease were subjected to surgical resection (arm A) and remaining was kept on 
      regular clinical follow-up (arm B). Overall survival (OS) was selected as the 
      primary endpoint. The secondary end points were disease-free survival (DFS) and 
      clinical toxicities. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 13.6 months. Pathological 
      complete response was seen in 60.9 % patients in arm A. In arm B, 77.3 % patients 
      attained radiological complete response (p = 0.194). The median OS was 16.4 and 
      19.1 months (p = 0.388) and median DFS was 5.8 and 4.1 months (p = 0.347) in arm 
      A and B, respectively. The 2-year survival probability was 39.1 and 36.4 % 
      (p = 0.387) in arm A and B, respectively. The recurrence probability was 56.5 % 
      (SE = 5.6 %) and 45.5 % (SE = 4.2 %) (p = 0.328) in arm A and B, respectively. 
      The probability of loco regional recurrence was more in arm B than in arm A 
      (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that there is no difference in 
      clinical toxicity profiles or survival outcomes with either definitive 
      chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiation followed by surgery in management of locally 
      advanced esophageal cancer.
