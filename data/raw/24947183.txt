      progressive curve, lead to addition of fusion levels?

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the changes in the curve extent, pattern and the fusion level 
      in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients who undergo delayed surgery 
      instead of early surgery. METHODS: Thirty-five immature AIS patients whose 
      radiographs demonstrated an initial primary curve of more than 40 degrees  with a 
      subsequent increase of 10 degrees  before attaining skeletal maturity with brace were 
      enrolled. The initial and the final radiographs taken before surgery were 
      compared to assess the changes in curve extent, pattern and the fusion levels as 
      recommended by King's, Lenke's and Suk's guidelines. RESULTS: The average age of 
      35 AIS patients was 12.7 +/- 1.6 years. The time interval between initial and final 
      radiography was 39.3 +/- 20.2 months and the degree of progress of the primary 
      curve was 13 +/- 9.7 degrees . Fusion levels changed in 33 (94.2%), 33 (94.2%) and 32 
      (91.4%) patients according to King's, Lenke's and Suk's guidelines, respectively. 
      Curve pattern was changed in 2 (5.7%), 12 (34.3%) and 10 (28.6) patients by 
      King's, Lenke's and Suk's guidelines. The mean number of levels requiring fusion 
      increased from 9.4 +/- 2.1 at initial visit to 11.1 +/- 1.8 at the final follow-up 
      using King's guidelines, 9.7 +/- 2.2-11.6 +/- 2.0 as per Lenke's guidelines and 9.1 +/- 
      2.0-11.5 +/- 2.3 when fusion was planned using Suk's guidelines (p < 0.001 in all 
      guidelines). CONCLUSIONS: Delay of surgery in immature AIS patients whose Cobb's 
      angle exceed 40 degrees  initially and showing subsequent progression of the curve, of 
      more than 10 degrees  can lead to alterations in the curve pattern and the need for 
      increase in fusion levels.
