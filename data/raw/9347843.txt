TI  - Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease: are 
      abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease contraindications?
PG  - 682-8; discussion 688-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because of the inflammatory nature of Crohn's disease, ileocolic 
      resections are often difficult to perform, especially if an abscess, phlegmon, or 
      recurrent disease at a previous ileocolic anastomosis is present. Our goal was to 
      determine whether the above factors are contraindications to a successful 
      laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection. METHODS: Between 1992 and 1996, 46 
      laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections were attempted. Fourteen patients had 
      an abscess or phlegmon treated with bowel rest before operation (group I), 10 
      patients had recurrent Crohn's disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis 
      (group II), and 22 patients had no previous operation and no phlegmon or abscess 
      associated with their disease (group III). These groups were compared with each 
      other and with 70 consecutive open ileocolic resections for Crohn's disease 
      during the same time period (group IV). RESULTS: Operative blood loss and time 
      were greater in group IV than in groups I, II, and III (245 versus 151, 131, and 
      195 ml, respectively, and 202 versus 152, 144, and 139 minutes, respectively). 
      Conversion to open procedure occurred in 5 patients (group I, 1 [7%]; group II, 2 
      [20%]; group III, 2 [9%]). Morbidity was highest in group IV (21% versus 0%, 10%, 
      and 10%, respectively). Only one patient died (group IV, 1%). Length of hospital 
      stay was longest in group IV (7.9 versus 4.8, 3.9, and 4.5 days, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The laparoscopic-assisted approach to Crohn's disease is feasible 
      and safe with good outcomes. Co-morbid preoperative findings such as abscess, 
      phlegmon, or recurrent disease at the previous ileocolic anastomosis are not 
      contraindications to a successful laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resection in 
      select patients.
