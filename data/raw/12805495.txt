TI  - Can patients be anticoagulated after intracerebral hemorrhage? A decision 
      analysis.
PG  - 1710-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Warfarin increases both the likelihood and the mortality 
      of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), particularly in patients with a history of 
      prior ICH. In light of this consideration, should a patient with both a history 
      of ICH and a clear indication for anticoagulation such as nonvalvular atrial 
      fibrillation be anticoagulated? In the absence of data from a clinical trial, we 
      used a decision-analysis model to compare the expected values of 2 treatment 
      strategies-warfarin and no anticoagulation-for such patients. METHODS: We used a 
      Markov state transition decision model stratified by location of hemorrhage 
      (lobar or deep hemispheric). Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life 
      years (QALYs). Data sources included English language literature identified 
      through MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected articles, along with 
      empirical data from our own institution. The base case focused on a 69-year-old 
      man with a history of ICH and newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. 
      RESULTS: For patients with prior lobar ICH, withholding anticoagulation therapy 
      was strongly preferred, improving quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.9 QALYs. 
      For patients with prior deep hemispheric ICH, withholding anticoagulation 
      resulted in a smaller gain of 0.3 QALYs. In sensitivity analyses for patients 
      with deep ICH, anticoagulation could be preferred if the risk of thromboembolic 
      stroke is particularly high. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of lobar ICH with atrial 
      fibrillation should not be offered long-term anticoagulation. Similarly, most 
      patients with deep hemispheric ICH and atrial fibrillation should not receive 
      anticoagulant therapy. However, patients with deep hemispheric ICH at 
      particularly high risk for thromboembolic stroke or low risk of ICH recurrence 
      might benefit from long-term anticoagulation.
