TI  - Must early postoperative oral intake be limited to laparoscopy?
PG  - 584-9
AB  - PURPOSE: This prospective, randomized study was designed to evaluate whether or 
      not early postoperative feeding (claimed as a unique benefit of laparoscopic 
      surgery) is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. METHODS: The 
      trial was performed between July 1, 1992 and October 31, 1992 and included all 64 
      consecutive patients who underwent laparotomy with either a colonic or an ileal 
      resection. In all cases the nasogastric tube was removed immediately after the 
      operation. Group 1 consisted of 32 patients (age range, 15-81 years; mean, 52 
      years) who received a regular diet on the first postoperative morning. Group 2 
      consisted of 32 patients (age range, 15-87 years; mean, 52 years) who were fed in 
      a traditional manner. Regular food was permitted after resolution of ileus as 
      defined by resumption of bowel movements in the absence of abdominal distention, 
      nausea, or vomiting. RESULTS: The rate of nasogastric tube reinsertion for 
      distention with persistent vomiting was 18.7 percent (six patients) in Group 1 
      and 12.5 percent (four patients) in Group 2. Although vomiting was experienced 
      more frequently by patients in Group 1 (44 percent vs. 25 percent, respectively), 
      there was no difference between the two groups with regard to the duration of 
      postoperative ileus (3.6 vs. 3.4 days, respectively). In the 26 patients from 
      Group 1 who did not require nasogastric tube reinsertion, there was a trend 
      toward shorter hospitalization (6.7 vs. 8.0 days, respectively). CONCLUSION: 
      Early oral intake is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection. Thus, 
      the laparoscopic surgeon's claim of early tolerated oral intake may not be unique 
      to laparoscopy.
