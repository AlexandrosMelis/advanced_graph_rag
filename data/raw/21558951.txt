AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether level of intrauterine cocaine exposure (IUCE) is 
      associated with early adolescent delinquent behavior, after accounting for 
      prenatal exposures to other psychoactive substances and relevant psychosocial 
      factors. METHODS: Ninety-three early adolescents (12.5-14.5 years old) 
      participating since birth in a longitudinal study of IUCE reported delinquent 
      acts via an audio computer-assisted self-interview. Level of IUCE and exposure to 
      cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana were determined by maternal report, maternal 
      and infant urine assays, and infant meconium assays at birth. Participants 
      reported their exposure to violence on the Violence Exposure Scale for 
      Children-Revised at ages 8.5, 9.5, and 11 years and during early adolescence, and 
      the strictness of supervision by their caregivers during early adolescence. 
      RESULTS: Of the 93 participants, 24 (26%) reported >/= 3 delinquent behaviors 
      during early adolescence. In the final multivariate model (including level of 
      IUCE and cigarette exposure, childhood exposure to violence, and caregiver 
      strictness/supervision) >/= 3 delinquent behaviors were not significantly 
      associated with level of IUCE but were significantly associated with intrauterine 
      exposure to half a pack or more of cigarettes per day and higher levels of 
      childhood exposure to violence, effects substantially unchanged after control for 
      early adolescent violence exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, prospectively 
      ascertained prenatal exposure to cigarettes and childhood exposure to violence 
      are associated with self-reported delinquent behaviors during early adolescence. 
      Contrary to initial popular predictions, intrauterine cocaine is not a strong 
      predictor of adolescent delinquent behaviors in this cohort.
