AB  - BACKGROUND: Web search engines are an important tool in communication and 
      diffusion of knowledge. Among these, Google appears to be the most popular one: 
      in August 2008, it accounted for 87% of all web searches in the UK, compared with 
      Yahoo's 3.3%. Google's value as a diagnostic guide in general medicine was 
      recently reported. The aim of this comparative cross-sectional study was to 
      evaluate whether searching Google with disease-related terms was effective in the 
      identification and diagnosis of complex immunological and allergic cases. 
      METHODS: Forty-five case reports were randomly selected by an independent 
      observer from peer-reviewed medical journals. Clinical data were presented 
      separately to three investigators, blinded to the final diagnoses. Investigator A 
      was a Consultant with an expert knowledge in Internal Medicine and Allergy (IM&A) 
      and basic computing skills. Investigator B was a Registrar in IM&A. Investigator 
      C was a Research Nurse. Both Investigators B and C were familiar with computers 
      and search engines. For every clinical case presented, each investigator 
      independently carried out an Internet search using Google to provide a final 
      diagnosis. Their results were then compared with the published diagnoses. 
      RESULTS: Correct diagnoses were provided in 30/45 (66%) cases, 39/45 (86%) cases, 
      and in 29/45 (64%) cases by investigator A, B, and C, respectively. All of the 
      three investigators achieved the correct diagnosis in 19 cases (42%), and all of 
      them failed in two cases. CONCLUSION: This Google-based search was useful to 
      identify an appropriate diagnosis in complex immunological and allergic cases. 
      Computing skills may help to get better results.
