AB  - BACKGROUND: Nobody has analyzed the sequelae of desmoids according to the type of 
      surgery that precipitated them. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether 
      the clinical effects of abdominal desmoids would be worse in patients with 
      restorative proctocolectomy than in patients with ileorectal anastomosis. DESIGN: 
      This is a retrospective, database study. PATIENTS: Included were patients with 
      familial adenomatous polyposis who had undergone proctocolectomy with IPAA or 
      colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, and subsequently developed an 
      intra-abdominal desmoid tumor. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome 
      measures were the clinical course of the desmoids; morbidity, and the requirement 
      for stoma. RESULTS: There were 86 patients: 49 had restorative proctocolectomy 
      and 37 had ileorectal anastomosis. Patient demographics were similar. Average 
      follow-up was 9.8 years (range, 2.7-23.8) and 16.3 years (range, 2.3 - 42.9). 
      Treatment of the desmoids included surgery (64.4% vs 65.6%), medical therapy 
      (69.4% vs 59.5%), chemotherapy (36.2% vs 30.0%), and radiotherapy (4.5% vs 
      10.0%), and was the same for each group. The overall complication rate of 
      desmoids was similar, approaching 70%. The risk of individual complications was 
      also similar (bleeding (2.0% vs 0.0%), fistula (10.2% vs 13.5%), bowel 
      obstruction (32.7% vs 48.6%), pain (34.7% vs 21.6%), and death related to desmoid 
      tumors (2.0% vs 10.8%)); 38.8% of the restorative proctocolectomy group and 51.4% 
      the ileorectal group had surgery for desmoid tumor complications (P = .21), and 
      22.4% and 22.2% of patients ultimately had permanent stomas. LIMITATIONS: This 
      study was limited by the relatively small numbers of patients. CONCLUSION: The 
      morbidity associated with desmoid tumors has not been shown to differ, whether 
      they arise after restorative proctocolectomy or ileorectal anastomosis.
