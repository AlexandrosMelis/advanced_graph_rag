TI  - Is the cell death in mesial temporal sclerosis apoptotic?
PG  - 778-84
AB  - PURPOSE: Mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) is characterized by neuronal loss in the 
      hippocampus. Studies on experimental models and patients with intractable 
      epilepsy suggest that apoptosis may be involved in neuronal death induced by 
      recurrent seizures. METHODS: We searched evidence for apoptotic cell death in 
      temporal lobes resected from drug-resistant epilepsy patients with MTS by using 
      the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (TUNEL) 
      method and immunohistochemistry for Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-cleaved actin 
      fragment, fractin. The temporal lobe specimens were obtained from 15 patients 
      (six women and nine men; mean age, 29 +/- 8 years). RESULTS: Unlike that in 
      normal adult brain, we observed Bcl-2 immunoreactivity in some of the remaining 
      neurons dispersed throughout the hippocampus proper as well as in most of the 
      reactive astroglia. Bax immunopositivity was increased in almost all neurons. 
      Fractin immunostaining, an indicator of caspase activity, was detected in 
      approximately 10% of these neurons. Despite increased Bax expression and 
      activation of caspases, we could not find evidence for DNA fragmentation by TUNEL 
      staining. We also could not detect typical apoptotic changes in nuclear 
      morphology by Hoechst-33258 or hematoxylin counterstaining. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      data suggest that either apoptosis is not involved in cell loss in MTS, or a very 
      slow rate of cell demise may have precluded detecting TUNEL-positive neurons 
      dying through apoptosis. Increased Bax expression and activation of caspases 
      support the latter possibility.
