TI  - Does menopausal transition affect the quality of life? A longitudinal study of 
      middle-aged women in Kinmen.
PG  - 885-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of menopausal 
      transition and menopausal symptoms in relation to quality of life in a cohort of 
      middle-aged women in Kinmen. DESIGN: A total of 734 premenopausal women 
      participated in the baseline study, and 579 women (78.9%) completed a follow-up 2 
      years later. Quality of life was assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study Short 
      Form-36. Participating women were asked for demographic data, about vasomotor 
      symptoms, and to complete the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 and the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: There was no demographic 
      difference between women who remained premenopausal and those who entered 
      perimenopause except for age. Vitality deteriorated no matter whether the women 
      stayed in premenopause or entered perimenopause. In multivariate analysis, only 
      vasomotor symptoms had an adverse influence on role limitation of emotion after 
      adjusting for age, education, menopausal status, baseline cognitive score, and 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score. The menopausal transition did not 
      influence the eight domains of the Short Form-36 in the multivariate regression 
      model. CONCLUSION: This longitudinal study found no significant effect of 
      menopausal transition on quality of life among Taiwanese women. The decline in 
      the role limitations due to emotional problems was related to vasomotor symptoms.
