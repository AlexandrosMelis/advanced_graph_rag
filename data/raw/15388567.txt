      athletes?
PG  - E23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the evidence base of sports medicine research and assess 
      how relevant and applicable it is to everyday practice. METHODS: Original 
      research articles, short reports, and case reports published in four major sport 
      and exercise medicine journals were studied and classified according to the main 
      topic of study and type of subjects used. RESULTS: The most common topic was 
      sports science, and very few studies related to the treatment of injuries and 
      medical conditions. The majority of published articles used healthy subjects 
      sampled from the sedentary population, and few studies have been carried out on 
      injured participants. CONCLUSIONS: There is a dearth of studies addressing 
      diagnostic and treatment interventions in the sports medicine literature. The 
      evidence base for sports medicine must continue to increase in terms of volume 
      and quality.
