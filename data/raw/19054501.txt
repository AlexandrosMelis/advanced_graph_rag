TI  - Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking 
      abnormality?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that schizophrenia patients have motion perception 
      deficit, which was thought to cause eye-tracking abnormality in schizophrenia. 
      However, eye movement closely interacts with motion perception. The known 
      eye-tracking difficulties in schizophrenia patients may interact with their 
      motion perception. METHODS: Two speed discrimination experiments were conducted 
      in a within-subject design. In experiment 1, the stimulus duration was 150 msec 
      to minimize the chance of eye-tracking occurrence. In experiment 2, the duration 
      was increased to 300 msec, increasing the possibility of eye movement intrusion. 
      Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment. RESULTS: At 
      150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia 
      patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33). At 300 msec, patients had 
      significantly higher thresholds than control subjects (p = .03). Furthermore, 
      frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly 
      correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in 
      patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects 
      but not patients. The frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was 
      not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance. CONCLUSIONS: Speed 
      discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed 
      abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or 
      integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a 
      novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of 
      concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two 
      systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception 
      abnormality in schizophrenia.
