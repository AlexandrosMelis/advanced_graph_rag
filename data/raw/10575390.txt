TI  - Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient 
      adherence?
PG  - 510-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare adherence to follow-up recommendations for colposcopy or 
      repeated Papanicolaou (Pap) smears for women with previously abnormal Pap smear 
      results. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Three northern California 
      family planning clinics. PATIENTS: All women with abnormal Pap smear results 
      referred for initial colposcopy and a random sample of those referred for 
      repeated Pap smear. Medical records were located and reviewed for 90 of 107 women 
      referred for colposcopy and 153 of 225 women referred for repeated Pap smears. 
      INTERVENTION: Routine clinic protocols for follow-up--telephone call, letter, or 
      certified letter--were applied without regard to the type of abnormality seen on 
      a Pap smear or recommended examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Documented 
      adherence to follow-up within 8 months of an abnormal result. Attempts to contact 
      the patients for follow-up, adherence to follow-up recommendations, and patient 
      characteristics were abstracted from medical records. The probability of 
      adherence to follow-up vs the number of follow-up attempts was modeled with 
      survival analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine 
      multivariate relationships related to adherence. RESULTS: The rate of overall 
      adherence to follow-up recommendations was 56.0% (136/243). Adherence to a second 
      colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear 
      (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46). The use of as many as 3 
      patient reminders substantially improved adherence to follow-up. Women without 
      insurance and women attending 1 of the 3 clinics were less likely to adhere to 
      any follow-up recommendation (hazard ratio for no insurance, 0.43 [95% confidence 
      interval, 0.20-0.93], and for clinic, 0.35 [95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.73]). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to follow-up was low in this family planning clinic 
      population, no matter what type of follow-up was advised. Adherence was improved 
      by the use of up to 3 reminders. Allocating resources to effective methods for 
      improving adherence to follow-up of abnormal results may be more important than 
      which follow-up procedure is recommended.
