TI  - Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma: really an early stage?
PG  - 514-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We review our results on surgical treatment of patients with stage I 
      non-small cell lung carcinoma and we attempted to clarify the prognostic 
      significance of some surgical--pathologic variables. METHODS: From 1993 to 1999, 
      667 patients received curative lung resection and complete hilar and mediastinal 
      lymphadenectomy for non-small cell lung cancer. Of these, there were 436 Stage I 
      disease (65%), of whom 144 T1N0 and 292 T2N0. No patients had pre- or 
      postoperative radio- or chemotherapy. Prognostic significance of the following 
      independent variables was tested using univariate (log-rank) and multivariate 
      (Cox proportional-hazards) analysis: type of resection (sublobar vs lobectomy vs 
      pneumonectomy), histology (squamous cell vs adenocarcinoma), tumour size (<or=3cm 
      vs >3cm), histologic vascular invasion, visceral pleura involvement, positive 
      bronchial resection margin, general T status. RESULTS: Overall 5-year survival 
      was 63%. In both univariate and multivariate survival analysis, significant 
      prognostic factors were histology (adenocarcinoma 65% vs squamous cell carcinoma 
      51%), tumour size (<or=3cm 67% vs >3cm 46%), and the presence of negative 
      resection margin. Five-year survival by general T status was 66% in T1N0 vs 55% 
      in T2N0 disease (P=0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Despite advances in early diagnosis and 
      surgical technique, 5-year survival of stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma 
      remains low as compared to survival of other solid organ neoplasm. Tumour size 
      <or=3cm, adenocarcinoma histologic type and negative bronchial resection margins 
      were associated with a more favourable outcome in our patient population. More 
      effective multimodality treatments are needed to increase survival rates.
