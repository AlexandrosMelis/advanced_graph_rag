AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bladder catheterisation is a routine part of major abdominal surgery. 
      Transurethral catheterisation is the most common method of bladder drainage but 
      is also notorious for its discomfort and increased risk of urinary tract 
      infection. The present study aimed to establish patient satisfaction with 
      transurethral catheterisation and to assess the incidence of clinically 
      significant urinary tract infections after transurethral catheterisation through 
      survey. METHODS: All patients who underwent major open abdominal surgery between 
      October 2006 and December 2008 and required standard transurethral bladder 
      catheterisation, were asked to participate in the study. Fifty patients were 
      recruited. RESULTS: Male patients were more dissatisfied than their female 
      counterparts with transurethral catheterisation (satisfaction score: 4.18/10 vs. 
      2.75/10; p = 0.05). Male patients had more than double the score for pain at the 
      urinary meatus with the catheter in situ (p =0.012) and during urine catheter 
      removal (p = 0.013). Half the patients in the study also had symptoms of urinary 
      tract infection after catheter removal. CONCLUSION: Our study emphasised the 
      discomfort of transurethral urinary catheters, especially in male patients, and 
      the high incidence of urinary tract infections in both sexes. Consideration 
      should be given to the utilisation of alternative methods of bladder drainage, 
      such as suprapubic catheterisation, which can be performed with ease during 
      laparotomy.
