TI  - Is atropine needed with ketamine sedation? A prospective, randomised, double 
      blind study.
PG  - 206-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare atropine with placebo as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in 
      children undergoing minor painful procedures. Outcome measures included 
      hypersalivation, side effect profile, parental/patient satisfaction, and 
      procedural success rate. METHODS: Children aged between 1 and 16 years of age 
      requiring ketamine procedural sedation in a tertiary emergency department were 
      randomised to receive 0.01 mg/kg of atropine or placebo. All received 4 mg/kg of 
      intramuscular ketamine. Tolerance and sedation scores were recorded throughout 
      the procedure. Side effects were recorded from the start of sedation until 
      discharge. Parental and patient satisfaction scores were obtained at discharge 
      and three to five days after the procedure, with the opportunity to report side 
      effects encountered at home. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients aged 13 months to 
      14.5 years (median age 3.4 years) were enrolled over a 16 month period. 
      Hypersalivation occurred in 11.4% of patients given atropine compared with 30.8% 
      given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.91). 
      A transient rash was observed in 22.7% of the atropine group compared with 5.1% 
      of the placebo group (OR 5.44, 95% CI 1.11 to 26.6). Vomiting during recovery 
      occurred in 9.1% of atropine patients compared with 25.6% of placebo patients (OR 
      0.29, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.02). There was a trend towards better tolerance in the 
      placebo group. No patient experienced serious side effects. CONCLUSION: Ketamine 
      sedation was successful and well tolerated in all cases. The use of atropine as 
      an adjunct for intramuscular ketamine sedation in children significantly reduces 
      hypersalivation and may lower the incidence of post-procedural vomiting. Atropine 
      is associated with a higher incidence of a transient rash. No serious adverse 
      events were noted.
