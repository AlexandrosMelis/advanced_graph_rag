TI  - Do approved doctors and medical referees in the UK agree when assessing a 
      seafarer's fitness?
PG  - 71-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The seafaring industry remains a hazardous occupation that requires 
      sophisticated systems of risk and fitness assessment. This study aims to 
      investigate the extent of agreement between Approved Doctors (ADs) and Medical 
      Referees (MRs) when they assess a seafarer's fitness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      Between 2003 and 2009 a total of 232,878 seafarer medical examinations were 
      carried out by ADs, of which 465 were considered by the MRs because the seafarer 
      appealed against the AD's decision. The extent of agreement between ADs and MRs 
      was studied. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-eight (58%) cases seen by the ADs 
      were classed as category 4 "permanently unfit"; the referees only placed 85 (18%) 
      of them in this category. On the other hand, 252 (54%) cases seen by the MRs were 
      classed as category 2 "fit with restrictions", while the ADs had only placed 111 
      (24%) in this category. The overall agreement between the assessors (AD vs. MR) 
      was poor (Kappa K = 0.18). DISCUSSION: For cardiovascular diseases and for mental 
      ill-health, access to additional information by the MR was the commonest reason 
      for changing the fitness category, but for all other conditions factors such as 
      the experience and knowledge of the MRs or their different interpretation of the 
      standards were the most frequent reasons for a change to fitness category or to 
      restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that there was poor agreement between 
      the AD's decision and the subsequent MR's decision regarding the fitness of those 
      seafarers who decided to appeal against the AD's initial assessment. The reasons 
      for this are considered.
