AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the use and delivery of cough and cold medicines in 
      children younger than 6 presenting to an inner-city pediatric emergency 
      department (PED) following 2007 FDA warnings. METHODS: A cross-sectional 
      observational study was performed using a convenience sampling of PED patients 
      during the fall of 2010. Caregivers were presented with 6 commonly used cough 
      medicine preparations and were asked to demonstrate if and how they would 
      administer these to their children. RESULTS: In all, 65 patients and their 
      caregivers consented and participated in the study. During the demonstration, 82% 
      (53/65) stated that they would treat with cough or cold medicines, and 72% 
      (38/53) incorrectly dosed the medication they desired to give. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Despite current recommendations, cough and cold medicines are still used in 
      children younger than 6 years of age. A significant portion of caregivers report 
      that they are still unaware of public warnings, potential side effects, and 
      interactions with other medications.
