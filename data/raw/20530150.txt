TI  - Is cholecystectomy really an indication for concomitant splenectomy in mild 
      hereditary spherocytosis?

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The British Committee for Standards in Haematology currently 
      recommends concomitant splenectomy in children with mild hereditary spherocytosis 
      (HS) undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones. However, splenectomy 
      is associated with a risk of life-threatening infection, particularly in young 
      children. The aim of this study was to audit the outcome of the practice of 
      uncoupling splenectomy and cholecystectomy in such patients. METHODS: Children 
      referred with symptomatic gallstones complicating HS between April 1999 and April 
      2009 were prospectively identified and reviewed retrospectively. During this 
      period, the policy was to undertake concomitant splenectomy only if indicated for 
      haematological reasons and not simply because of planned cholecystectomy. 
      RESULTS: A total of 16 patients (mean age 10.4, range 3.7 to 16 years, 11 women) 
      with HS and symptomatic gallstones underwent cholecystectomy. Three patients 
      subsequently required a splenectomy for haematological reasons 0.8-2.5 years 
      after cholecystectomy; all three splenectomies were performed laparoscopically. 
      There were no postoperative complications in the 16 patients; postoperative 
      hospital stay was 1-3 days after either cholecystectomy or splenectomy. The 13 
      children with a retained spleen remain under regular review by a haematologist 
      (median follow-up 4.6, range 0.5 to 10.6 years) and are well and transfusion 
      independent. CONCLUSIONS: The advice to perform a concomitant splenectomy in 
      children with mild HS undergoing cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones needs 
      revisiting. In the era of minimal access surgery, the need for splenectomy in 
      such children should be judged on its own merits.
