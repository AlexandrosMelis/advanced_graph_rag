AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective outcome measurement study. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of 
      this study is to assess whether ossification of the posterior longitudinal 
      ligament (OPLL) affects neurologic outcomes in patients with acute cervical 
      spinal cord injury (SCI). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There have so far been few 
      reports examining the relationship between OPLL and SCI and there is controversy 
      regarding the deteriorating effects of OPLL-induced canal stenosis on neurologic 
      outcomes. METHODS: To obtain a relatively uniform background, patients 
      nonsurgically treated for an acute C3-C4 level SCI without any fractures or 
      dislocations of the spinal column were selected, resulting in 129 patients. There 
      were 110 men and 19 women (mean age was 61.1 years), having various neurologic 
      conditions on admission (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] impairment 
      scale A, 43; B, 16; C, 58; D, 12). The follow-up period was the duration of their 
      hospital stay and ranged from 50 to 603 days (mean, 233 days). The presence of 
      OPLL, the cause of injury, the degree of canal stenosis (both static and 
      dynamic), and the neurologic outcomes in motor function, including improvement 
      rate, were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients investigated in this study, 
      OPLL was identified at the site of the injury in 13 patients (10.1%). In this 
      OPLL+ group, the static and dynamic canal diameters at C3 and C4 were 
      significantly smaller than those of the remaining 116 patients (OPLL- group). 
      However, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups in terms of 
      ASIA motor score both at the time of administration and discharge, and the mean 
      improvement rate in ASIA motor score was 55.5 +/- 9.0% in OPLL+ group, while it 
      was 43.1 +/- 2.8% in the OPLL-group. Furthermore, no significant correlation was 
      observed between the static/dynamic canal diameters and neurologic outcome in all 
      129 patients. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found for OPLL to have any effect on 
      the initial neurologic status or recovery in motor function after traumatic 
      cervical cord injury, suggesting that the neurologic outcome is not significantly 
      dependent on canal space.
