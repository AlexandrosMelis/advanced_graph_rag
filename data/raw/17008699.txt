TI  - Do patients with localized prostate cancer treatment really want more aggressive 
      treatment?
PG  - 4581-6
AB  - PURPOSE: Examine whether patients with prostate cancer choose the more aggressive 
      of two radiotherapeutic options, whether this choice is reasoned, and what the 
      determinants of the choice are. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty patients 
      with primary prostate cancer (T(1-3)N(0)M(0)) were informed by means of a 
      decision aid of two treatment options: radiotherapy with 70 Gy versus 74 Gy. The 
      latter treatment is associated with more cure and more toxicity. The patients 
      were asked whether they wanted to choose, and if so which treatment they 
      preferred. They also assigned importance weights to the probability of various 
      outcomes, such as survival, cure and adverse effects. Patients who wanted to 
      choose their own treatment (n = 119) are described here. RESULTS: The majority of 
      these patients (75%) chose the lower radiation dose. Their choice was highly 
      consistent (P < or = .001), with the importance weights assigned to the 
      probability of survival, cure (odds ratio [OR] = 6.7 and 6.9) and late GI and 
      genitourinary adverse effects (OR = 0.1 and 0.2). The lower dose was chosen more 
      often by the older patients, low-risk patients, patients without hormone 
      treatment, and patients with a low anxiety or depression score. CONCLUSION: Most 
      patients with localized prostate cancer prefer the lower radiation dose. Our 
      findings indicate that many patients attach more weight to specific 
      quality-of-life aspects (eg, GI toxicity) than to improving survival. Treatment 
      preferences of patients with localized prostate cancer can and should be involved 
      in radiotherapy decision making.
