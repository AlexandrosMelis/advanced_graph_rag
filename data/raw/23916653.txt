AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recently, orthostatic myoclonus (OM) has been suggested 
      as a cause of gait impairment and unsteadiness in neurodegenerative diseases. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its 
      clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders. 
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface 
      recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was 
      performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was 
      observed (duration range 20-100 ms; bursts per second </=16). RESULTS: Among 93 
      subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n = 16; 17.2%), followed by 
      orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). 
      All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or 
      during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during 
      orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 
      patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as 
      multiple system atrophy (n = 3) Parkinson's disease (n = 2), Alzheimer's disease 
      (n = 2), mild cognitive impairment (n = 2) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n = 
      2). Although four subjects showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with 
      antimyoclonic treatment, the follow-up was not systematic enough to evaluate 
      their therapeutic effect on OM. CONCLUSIONS: Orthostatic myoclonus is often 
      underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects 
      with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an 
      aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.
