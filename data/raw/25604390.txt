AB  - BACKGROUND: Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) may act as a tumor suppressor as it is 
      down-regulated in various types of cancer. This study assessed the DKK3 protein 
      expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker. 
      METHODS: DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric 
      cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. 
      Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed. RESULTS: Loss of 
      DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated 
      with advanced T stage (p < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001), UICC TNM 
      stage (p < 0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 
      0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in 
      tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than 
      those with DKK3 expression (p < 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p 
      = 0.028 and p < 0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, 
      respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. 
      Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), 
      loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in 
      patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The 
      combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging 
      for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients. 
      CONCLUSION: Loss of DKK3 protein expression was significantly associated with 
      poor survival in patients with gastric cancer and was strongly correlated with 
      the TNM stage. DKK3 might be a potential biomarker of lymph node involvement that 
      can improve the predictive power of CT.
