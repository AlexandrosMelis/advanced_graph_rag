TI  - Is breast cancer prognosis inherited?
PG  - R39
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A genetic component is well established in the etiology of breast 
      cancer. It is not well known, however, whether genetic traits also influence 
      prognostic features of the malignant phenotype. METHODS: We carried out a 
      population-based cohort study in Sweden based on the nationwide Multi-Generation 
      Register. Among all women with breast cancer diagnosed from 1961 to 2001, 2,787 
      mother-daughter pairs and 831 sister pairs with breast cancer were identified; we 
      achieved complete follow-up and classified 5-year breast cancer-specific 
      prognosis among proband (mother or oldest sister) into tertiles as poor, 
      intermediary, or good. We used Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival proportions and 
      Cox models to calculate relative risks of dying from breast cancer within 5 years 
      depending on the proband's outcome. RESULTS: The 5-year survival proportion among 
      daughters whose mothers died within 5 years was 87% compared to 91% if the mother 
      was alive (p = 0.03). Among sisters, the corresponding proportions were 70% and 
      88%, respectively (p = 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders, 
      daughters and sisters of a proband with poor prognosis had a 60% higher 5-year 
      breast cancer mortality compared to those of a proband with good prognosis 
      (hazard ratio [HR], 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2 to 2.2; p for trend 
      0.002). This association was slightly stronger among sisters (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 
      1.0 to 3.4) than among daughters (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3). CONCLUSION: 
      Breast cancer prognosis of a woman predicts the survival in her first-degree 
      relatives with breast cancer. Our novel findings suggest that breast cancer 
      prognosis might be inherited.
