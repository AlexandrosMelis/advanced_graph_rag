AB  - BACKGROUND: The "health workforce" crisis has led to an increased interest in 
      health professional education, including MPH programs. Recently, it was 
      questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health 
      prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and 
      middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously 
      difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of 
      MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as "impact on workplace" and 
      "impact on society," which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted 
      and to what effect within the context of the graduates' workplaces, as well as on 
      societal health. METHODS: This is part of a larger six-country mixed method 
      study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English 
      language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the 
      other a residential program in the Netherlands. Both offer MPH training to 
      students from a diversity of countries. In-depth interviews were conducted with 
      10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, 
      their peers, and their supervisors. RESULTS: Impact on the workplace was reported 
      as considerable by graduates and peers as well as supervisors and included 
      changes in management and leadership: promotion to a leadership position as well 
      as expanded or revitalized management roles were reported by many participants. 
      The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, 
      and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in 
      the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting 
      up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and 
      training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' 
      influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral 
      approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, 
      policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and 
      context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates 
      were able to have effect. Self-selection of graduates and their role in selecting 
      peers and supervisors may have resulted in some bias, some graduates could not be 
      traced, and social acceptability bias may have influenced findings. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was considerable impact at many levels; graduates were perceived to be able 
      to contribute significantly to their workplaces and often had influence at the 
      national level. Much of the impact described was in line with public health 
      educational aims. The qualitative method study revealed more in-depth 
      understanding of graduates' impact as well as their career pathways.
