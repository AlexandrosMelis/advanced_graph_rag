TI  - Is low birth weight a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection?
PG  - 44-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congenital cytomegalovirus infection is currently the leading cause 
      of congenital infection in 0.2-2.2% of live births worldwide leading to variable 
      serious sequalae. The aim of the study was to determine if low birth weight is an 
      indicator of CMV congenital infection evidenced by detecting CMV-DNA in umbilical 
      cord blood at the time of delivery. METHODOLOGY: CMV-IgG and IgM antibodies and 
      CMV-DNAemia were assessed in umbilical cord blood of two hundreds newborns, one 
      hundred of whom had birth weight < or = 2700 gram and/or head circumference < or 
      = 32 cm. RESULTS: CMV-IgM was not detected, while CMV-IgG was positive in 80-90% 
      of the two hundreds tested newborns. CMV-DNA was detected in four out of the 200 
      newborns. One of them was over the adopted weight limit (> 2700 gram). 
      CONCLUSIONS: CMV-IgM and IgG antibodies assessment was not a potential 
      discriminative test to identify congenitally infected newborns. In addition, low 
      birth weight and small head circumference at birth failed to predict congenital 
      CMV infection. CMV-DNA detection in umbilical cord blood at the time of delivery 
      using real-time PCR of all newborns is recommended as decisive, rapid and 
      non-invasive test.
