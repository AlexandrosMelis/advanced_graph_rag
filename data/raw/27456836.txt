TI  - Do Electrochemiluminescence Assays Improve Prediction of Time to Type 1 Diabetes 
      in Autoantibody-Positive TrialNet Subjects?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore whether electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assays can help 
      improve prediction of time to type 1 diabetes in the TrialNet 
      autoantibody-positive population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: TrialNet subjects 
      who were positive for one or more autoantibodies (microinsulin autoantibody, 
      GAD65 autoantibody [GADA], IA-2A, and ZnT8A) with available ECL-insulin 
      autoantibody (IAA) and ECL-GADA data at their initial visit were analyzed; after 
      a median follow-up of 24 months, 177 of these 1,287 subjects developed diabetes. 
      RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed that autoantibodies by radioimmunoassays 
      (RIAs), ECL-IAA, ECL-GADA, age, sex, number of positive autoantibodies, presence 
      of HLA DR3/4-DQ8 genotype, HbA1c, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 
      measurements were all significantly associated with progression to diabetes. 
      Subjects who were ECL positive had a risk of progression to diabetes within 6 
      years of 58% compared with 5% for the ECL-negative subjects (P < 0.0001). 
      Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were compared, with the base model 
      including age, sex, OGTT measurements, and number of positive autoantibodies by 
      RIAs. The model with positivity for ECL-GADA and/or ECL-IAA was the best, and 
      factors that remained significantly associated with time to diabetes were area 
      under the curve (AUC) C-peptide, fasting C-peptide, AUC glucose, number of 
      positive autoantibodies by RIAs, and ECL positivity. Adding ECL to the Diabetes 
      Prevention Trial risk score (DPTRS) improved the receiver operating 
      characteristic curves with AUC of 0.83 (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: ECL assays 
      improved the ability to predict time to diabetes in these autoantibody-positive 
      relatives at risk for developing diabetes. These findings might be helpful in the 
      design and eligibility criteria for prevention trials in the future.
