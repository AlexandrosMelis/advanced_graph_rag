TI  - Is peak concentration needed in therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin? A 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis in patients with methicillin-resistant 
      staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We analyzed the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of 
      vancomycin to determine the drug exposure parameters that correlate with the 
      efficacy and nephrotoxicity of vancomycin in patients with methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia and evaluated the need to use peak concentration 
      in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). METHODS: Serum drug concentrations of 31 
      hospitalized patients treated with vancomycin for methicillin-resistant S. aureus 
      pneumonia were collected. RESULTS: Significant differences in trough 
      concentration (Cmin)/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and area under the 
      serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-24)/MIC were observed between the response 
      and non-response groups. Significant differences in Cmin and AUC0-24 were 
      observed between the nephrotoxicity and non-nephrotoxicity groups. Receiver 
      operating characteristic curves revealed high predictive values of Cmin/MIC and 
      AUC0-24/MIC for efficacy and of Cmin and AUC0-24 for safety of vancomycin. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest little need to use peak concentration in 
      vancomycin TDM because Cmin/MIC and Cmin are sufficient to predict the efficacy 
      and safety of vancomycin.
