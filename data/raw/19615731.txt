AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic findings support a positive association between asthma 
      and obesity. OBJECTIVE: Determine whether obesity or increasing level of body 
      mass index (BMI) are associated with worse asthma control in an ethnically 
      diverse urban population. METHODS: Cross-sectional assessment of asthma control 
      was performed in patients with asthma recruited from primary care offices by 
      using 4 different validated asthma control questionnaires: the Asthma Control and 
      Communication Instrument (ACCI), the Asthma Control Test (ACT), the Asthma 
      Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and the Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire 
      (ATAQ). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the 
      association between obesity and increasing BMI level and asthma control. RESULTS: 
      Of 292 subjects with a mean age of 47 years, the majority were women (82%) and 
      African American (67%). There was a high prevalence of obesity with 63%, with 
      only 15% normal weight. The mean score from all 4 questionnaires showed an 
      average suboptimal asthma control (mean score/maximum possible score): ACCI 
      (8.3/19), ACT (15.4/25), ACQ (2.1/6), and ATAQ (1.3/4). Regression analysis 
      showed no association between obesity or increasing BMI level and asthma control 
      using all 4 questionnaires. This finding persisted even after adjusting for 
      FEV(1), smoking status, race, sex, selected comorbid illnesses, and long-term 
      asthma controller use. CONCLUSION: Using 4 validated asthma control 
      questionnaires, we failed to find an association between obesity and asthma 
      control in an urban population with asthma. Weight loss may not be an appropriate 
      strategy to improve asthma control in this population.
