AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies have suggested that hypertriglyceridemia and 
      insulin resistance are related to the development of colon cancer. Nuclear 
      peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which play a central role in 
      lipid and glucose metabolism, had been hypothesized as being involved in colon 
      cancerogenesis. In animal studies the lipid-lowering PPAR ligand bezafibrate 
      suppressed colonic tumors. However, the effect of bezafibrate on colon cancer 
      development in humans is unknown. Therefore, we proposed to investigate a 
      possible preventive effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer in 
      patients with coronary artery disease during a 6-year follow-up. METHODS: Our 
      population included 3011 patients without any cancer diagnosis who were enrolled 
      in the randomized, double blind Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention (BIP) Study. 
      The patients received either 400 mg of bezafibrate retard (1506 patients) or 
      placebo (1505 patients) once a day. Cancer incidence data were obtained by 
      matching a subject's identification numbers with the National Cancer Registry. 
      Each matched record was checked for correct identification. RESULTS: Development 
      of new cancer (all types) was recorded in 177 patients: in 79 (5.25%) patients 
      from the bezafibrate group vs. 98 (6.51%) from the placebo group. Development of 
      colon cancer was recorded in 25 patients: in 8 (0.53%) patients from the 
      bezafibrate group vs. 17 (1.13%) from the placebo group, (Fisher's exact test: 
      one side p = 0.05; two side p = 0.07). A difference in the incidence of cancer 
      was only detectable after a 4 year lag and progressively increased with continued 
      follow-up. On multivariable analysis the colon cancer risk in patients who 
      received bezafibrate tended to be lower with a hazard ratio of 0.47 and 95% 
      confidence interval 0.2-1.1. CONCLUSION: Our data, derived from patients with 
      coronary artery disease, support the hypothesis regarding a possible preventive 
      effect of bezafibrate on the development of colon cancer.
