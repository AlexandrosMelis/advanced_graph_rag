TI  - Is endothelin-1 an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis?
PG  - 603-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We have reported previously that cerulein-induced edematous 
      pancreatitis would transform into hemorrhagic pancreatitis by administration of 
      endothelin-1 in rats. In the present study, we tried to protect rat model from 
      developing into hemorrhagic pancreatitis with BQ123 (an ETA receptor antagonist). 
      METHODS: The rat model was made by 5-hour restraint water-immersion stress and 
      two intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (40 micrograms/kg) at hourly interval. 
      BQ123 (3 or 6 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 minutes before and 2 hours 
      after the first cerulein injection. RESULTS: Acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis was 
      induced in all rats treated with cerulin + stress. The score for pancreatic 
      hemorrhage was 2.4 +/- 0.2 in this group. In the rats pretreated with BQ123, the 
      score was reduced to 1.0 +/- 0.0, pancreas wet weight and serum amylase activity 
      were significantly reduced, and histologic alterations in the pancreas lightened, 
      also the local pancreatic blood flow improved without affecting the systemic 
      blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that endothelin-1 should play 
      a role in aggravating the development of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis, through 
      its action on the pancreatic microcirculation.
