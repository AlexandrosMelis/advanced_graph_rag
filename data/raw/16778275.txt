TI  - Is routine chest radiography after transbronchial biopsy necessary?: A 
      prospective study of 350 cases.
PG  - 1561-4
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVE: Pneumothorax following flexible bronchoscopy (FB) 
      with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) occurs in 1 to 6% of cases. Routine chest 
      radiography (CXR) following TBB is therefore requested by most pulmonologists in 
      an attempt to detect complications, particularly pneumothorax. The objective of 
      this study was to determine if routine CXR after bronchoscopy and TBB is 
      necessary. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study group included 350 consecutive patients 
      who underwent FB with TBB at our institution between December 2001 and January 
      2004. Routine CXR was performed up to 2 h after the procedure in all cases. 
      Additionally, the following information was recorded in all patients: sex, age, 
      immune status, indication for bronchoscopy, total number of biopsies done, 
      segment sampled, pulse oxygen saturation, and development of symptoms suggestive 
      of pneumothorax. RESULTS: Pneumothorax was diagnosed radiologically in 10 
      patients (2.9%). Seven patients had symptoms strongly suggestive of pneumothorax 
      prior to CXR, including four patients with large (> 10%) pneumothorax. The other 
      three patients were asymptomatic, with only minimal pneumothorax (</= 10%), which 
      resolved completely 24 to 48 h later. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that routine CXR 
      after bronchoscopy with TBB is necessary only in patients with symptoms 
      suggestive of pneumothorax. In asymptomatic patients, pneumothorax is rare and 
      usually small, so routine CXR is not necessary in this category of patients.
