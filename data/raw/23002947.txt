AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine survival with and without a percutaneous endoscopic 
      gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube using rigorous methods to account for selection 
      bias and to examine whether the timing of feeding tube insertion affected 
      survival. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: All U.S. nursing homes 
      (NHs). PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six thousand four hundred ninety-two NH residents 
      with advanced cognitive impairment from dementia and new problems eating studied 
      between 1999 and 2007. MEASUREMENTS: Survival after development of the need for 
      eating assistance and feeding tube insertion. RESULTS: Of the 36,492 NH residents 
      (88.4% white, mean age 84.9, 87.4% with one feeding tube risk factor), 1,957 
      (5.4%) had a feeding tube inserted within 1 year of developing eating problems. 
      After multivariate analysis correcting for selection bias with propensity score 
      weights, no difference was found in survival between the two groups (adjusted 
      hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-1.13). In 
      residents who were tube-fed, the timing of PEG tube insertion relative to the 
      onset of eating problems was not associated with survival after feeding tube 
      insertion (AHR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.86-1.20, persons with a PEG tube inserted 
      within 1 month of developing an eating problem versus later (4 months) 
      insertion). CONCLUSION: Neither insertion of PEG tubes nor timing of insertion 
      affect survival.
