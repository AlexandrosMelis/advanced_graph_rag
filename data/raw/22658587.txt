      'good' improve physical health?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' can be used to control 
      exercise intensity amongst both active and sedentary individuals and should 
      support exercise adherence. It is not known, however, whether affect-regulated 
      exercise training can lead to physical health gains. The aim of this study was to 
      examine if affect-regulated exercise to feel 'good' leads to improved fitness 
      over the course of an 8-week training programme. DESIGN: A repeated measures 
      design (pretest-posttest) with independent groups (training and control). 
      METHODS: 20 sedentary females completed a submaximal graded exercise test and 
      were then allocated to either a training group or control group. The training 
      group completed two supervised sessions and one unsupervised session per week for 
      8 weeks. Exercise intensity was affect-regulated to feel 'good'. Following the 8 
      weeks of training, both groups completed a second submaximal graded exercise 
      test. RESULTS: Repeated measures analyses of variance indicated a significant 
      increase in the time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group (318 +/- 
      23.7s) compared to control (248 +/- 16.9s). Overall compliance to training was high 
      (>92%). Participants in the training group exercised at intensities that would be 
      classified as being in the lower range of the recommended guidelines ( approximately  50% 
      V O(2) max) for cardiovascular health. CONCLUSIONS: Affect-regulated exercise to 
      feel 'good' can be used in a training programme to regulate exercise intensity. 
      This approach led to a 19% increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold, which 
      is indicative of improved fitness.
