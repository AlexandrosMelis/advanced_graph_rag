AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the impact of patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) on 
      survival, functional status, and quality of life (QoL) after aortic valve 
      replacement (AVR) with small prosthesis size in elderly patients. METHODS: 
      Between January 2005 and December 2013, 152 patients with pure aortic stenosis, 
      aged at least 75 years, underwent AVR, with a 19 or 21 mm prosthetic heart valve. 
      PPM was defined as an indexed effective orifice area less than 0.85 cm/m. Median 
      age was 82 years (range 75-93 years). Mean follow-up was 56 months (range 1-82 
      months) and was 98% complete. Late survival rate, New York Heart Association 
      functional class, and QoL (RAND SF-36) were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, PPM was 
      found in 78 patients (53.8%). Among them, 42 patients (29%) had an indexed 
      effective orifice area less than 0.75 cm/m and 17 less than 0.65 cm/m (11.7%). 
      Overall survival at 5 years was 78 +/- 4.5% and was not influenced by PPM (P = NS). 
      The mean New York Heart Association class for long-term survivors with PPM 
      improved from 3.0 to 1.7 (P < 0.001). QoL (physical functioning 45.18 +/- 11.35, 
      energy/fatigue 49.36 +/- 8.64, emotional well being 58.84 +/- 15.44, social 
      functioning 61.29 +/- 6.15) was similar to that of no-PPM patients (P = NS). 
      CONCLUSION: PPM after AVR does not affect survival, functional status, and QoL in 
      patients aged at least 75 years. Surgical procedures, often time-consuming, 
      contemplated to prevent PPM, may therefore be not justified in this patient 
      subgroup.
