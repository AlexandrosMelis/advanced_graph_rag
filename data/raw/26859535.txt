      Medical Center: Will We Miss Cancers Following Updated Guidelines?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Updated guidelines for the screening and management of cervical cancer 
      in the United States recommend starting Papanicolaou (Pap) testing at age 21 and 
      screening less frequently with less aggressive management for abnormalities. We 
      sought to examine updated Pap test screening guidelines and how they may affect 
      the detection of invasive cervical cancer, especially among women <30 years of 
      age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed at Brigham and Women's Hospital 
      with invasive cervical cancer between 2002 and 2012 were retrospectively 
      identified. Prior screening history was obtained and patients were divided into 
      two groups based on age <30 years or age >/=30 years. The two groups were then 
      compared with respect to demographics, pathological findings, and time to 
      diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 288 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma were 
      identified. Among these patients, 109 had adequate information on prior screening 
      history. Invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) was diagnosed in 37 (33.94%) patients, 
      whereas 64 (58.72%) patients were diagnosed with invasive squamous cell carcinoma 
      (ISCC). The remaining eight patients were diagnosed with other types of cancers 
      of the cervix. A total of 13 patients were younger than 30 while 96 patients were 
      30 or older. The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of IAC was 15 months in 
      patients younger than 30 years of age compared to 56 months in patients aged 30 
      and older (p < 0.001). The mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of ISCC was 38 
      months in patients younger than 30 years of age and 82 months in patients aged 30 
      and older (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: In this small retrospective study, updated Pap 
      test screening guidelines would not have missed invasive cancer on average among 
      screened women age 30 and older. However, young patients aged 21-29 years may be 
      at increased risk of developing IAC of the cervix between the recommended 
      screening intervals.
