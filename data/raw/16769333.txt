TI  - Preoperative tracheobronchoscopy in newborns with esophageal atresia: does it 
      matter?
PG  - 1054-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Despite surgical refinements, perioperative use of 
      tracheobronchoscopy (TBS) as part of surgical approach to esophageal atresia (EA) 
      is still controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence 
      of preoperative TBS in newborns with EA in preventing complications and improving 
      diagnosis and surgical treatment. METHODS: In the period ranging from 1997 to 
      2003, 62 patients with EA underwent preoperative TBS. The procedure was carried 
      out with flexible bronchoscope maintaining spontaneous breathing. When a wide 
      carinal fistula was found, this was mechanically occluded by Fogarty catheter and 
      cannulated with rigid bronchoscopy. Type of EA, surgical procedure variations 
      caused by TBS, and associated anomalies not easily detectable were recorded. 
      RESULTS: Before TBS, the Gross classification of the 62 patients was as follows: 
      type A, 9 patients; type B, none; type C, 51 patients. At TBS, however, 3 of 9 
      type A patients had an unsuspected proximal fistula (type B). These 3 patients, 
      plus the 2 with H-type fistula, were repaired through a cervical approach. In 4 
      patients, previously undetected malformations of the respiratory tree (2 aberrant 
      right upper bronchus and 2 hypoplastic bronchi) were found at TBS. Carinal 
      fistulas in 14 type C patients were occluded by Fogarty catheter to improve 
      ventilation during repair. No complications were observed. Overall, TBS was 
      clinically useful in 28 (45.2%) of 62 patients, including 15 (24.2%) of 62 
      infants in whom it was crucial in modifying the surgical approach. CONCLUSION: 
      Tracheobronchoscopy is a useful and safe procedure and should be recommended in 
      tertiary centers for babies with EA before surgical repair.
