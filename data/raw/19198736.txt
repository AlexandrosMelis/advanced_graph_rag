AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze prevalence and risk factors for retinopathy of prematurity 
      (ROP) among preterm infants born small for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate 
      for gestational age (AGA). METHODS: A prospective cohort study included preterm 
      infants with birth weight (BW) < or = 1,500 grams and gestational age (GA) < or = 
      32 weeks, divided into two groups: AGA or SGA. Prevalences and risk factors for 
      ROP were determined in both groups. Logistic regression was used for the 
      significant variables after univariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 345 patients 
      were examined: 199 included in the AGA group and 146 in the SGA. Mean BW and GA 
      in the whole cohort (345 patients) were 1,128.12 grams (+/-239.9) and 29.7 weeks 
      (+/-1.9), respectively. The prevalence of any stage ROP and severe ROP (needing 
      treatment) was 29.6 and 7.0%, respectively. ROP in any evolutive stage developed 
      in 66 AGA (33.2%) and in 36 SGA (24.7%) (p = 0.111). Severe ROP occurred in 15 
      AGA (7.5%) and in nine SGA (6.2%) (p = 0.779). After adjusted logistic 
      regression, weight gain from birth to sixth week of life and need for blood 
      transfusions were found to be significant risk factors for ROP in both groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that being SGA was not a significant risk 
      factor for any stage ROP or for severe ROP in this cohort and, also, that the 
      risk factors for ROP were similar among SGA and AGA very-low-birth-weight preterm 
      babies.
