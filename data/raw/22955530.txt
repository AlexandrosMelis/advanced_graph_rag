AB  - BACKGROUND: The range of injury severity that can be seen within the category of 
      type II supracondylar humerus fractures (SCHFs) raises the question whether some 
      could be treated nonoperatively. However, the clinical difficulty in using this 
      approach lies in determining which type II SCHFs can be managed successfully 
      without a surgical intervention. METHODS: We reviewed clinical and radiographic 
      information on 259 pediatric type II SCHFs that were enrolled in a prospective 
      registry of elbow fractures. The characteristics of the patients who were treated 
      without surgery were compared with those of patients who were treated surgically. 
      Treatment outcomes, as assessed by the final clinical and radiographic alignment, 
      range of motion of the elbow, and complications, were compared between the groups 
      to define clinical and radiographic features that related to success or failure 
      of nonoperative management. RESULTS: During the course of treatment, 39 fractures 
      were found to have unsatisfactory alignment with nonoperative management and were 
      taken for surgery. Ultimately, 150 fractures (57.9%) were treated nonoperatively, 
      and 109 fractures (42.1%) were treated surgically. At final follow-up, outcome 
      measures of change in carrying angle, range of motion, and complications did not 
      show clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Fractures 
      without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar 
      angle of >15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful 
      nonsurgical treatment. A scoring system was developed using these features to 
      stratify the severity of the injury. Patients with isolated extension deformity, 
      but none of the other features, were more likely to complete successful 
      nonoperative management. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that some of the less 
      severe pediatric type II SCHFs can be successfully treated without surgery if 
      close follow-up is achieved. Fractures with initial rotational deformity, coronal 
      malalignment, and significant extension of the distal fragment are likely to fail 
      a nonoperative approach. An algorithm using the initial radiographic 
      characteristics can aid in distinguishing groups.
