TI  - Serovar specific immunity to Neisseria gonorrhoeae: does it exist?
PG  - 367-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the host immune response to gonorrhoea provides 
      limited serovar specific protection from reinfection. SUBJECTS: 508 episodes of 
      gonorrhoea diagnosed at a city centre genitourinary medicine clinic including 22 
      patients with multiple infections over a 4 year period. METHODS: Patients with 
      recurrent gonococcal infection were analysed with respect to the initial and 
      subsequent serovars isolated. RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in the 
      prevalence of serovars isolated following a repeat infection compared with those 
      without repeat infections. The site of the initial infection did not appear to 
      influence the subsequent serovar isolated. CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of 
      serovar specific immunity in our population. It remains possible that populations 
      with a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and more frequent infections may have a 
      quantitatively greater immune response.
