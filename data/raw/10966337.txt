TI  - A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are 
      they effective?
PG  - 223-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay or 23-hour ward in a 
      pediatric unit of a large teaching hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic 
      Children's hospital, The New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a 
      useful addition to the emergency service. METHODS: This is a descriptive 
      comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short 
      stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the 
      New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. These hospitals service an 
      identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The 
      following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, 
      rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 
      hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was 
      attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. RESULTS: The short stay ward 
      accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of 
      admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder 
      procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, 
      gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting 
      for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital 
      efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) 
      compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay 
      ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 
      hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of 
      patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared 
      to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 
      hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events 
      reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short 
      stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the 
      hospital to the short stay ward. This resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 
      million (Westmead Hospital) to $2.3 million (New Children's Hospital) to the 
      hospital, due to more efficient bed usage. CONCLUSION: This data demonstrates the 
      robust nature of the short stay ward. At these two very different institutions we 
      have shown improved bed efficient and patient care in a cost-effective way. We 
      have also reported on greater parental satisfaction and early return of the child 
      with their family to the community.
