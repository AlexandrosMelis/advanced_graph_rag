      radiologists?

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Despite rapid adoption of the Hirsch index (h-index) as 
      a measure of academic success, the correlations between the h-index and other 
      metrics of productivity remain poorly understood. The aims of this study were to 
      determine whether h-indices were associated with greater National Institutes of 
      Health (NIH) funding success among academic radiologists. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Using the Scopus database, h-indices were calculated for a random sample of 
      academic radiologists with the rank of professor. Using the NIH tool Research 
      Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports, we determined the 
      number, classification, and total years of NIH grant funding as principal 
      investigator for each radiologist. Differences in h-index, sorted by funding 
      status, were determined using Wilcoxon's tests. Associations between h-index and 
      funding status were determined using logistic regression. Significant 
      correlations between h-index and grant metrics were determined using Spearman's 
      rho. RESULTS: Among 210 professors of radiology, 48 (23%) secured at least one NIH 
      grant. The mean h-index was significantly higher among individuals who secured at 
      least one NIH grant (19.1) compared to those who did not (10.4) (P < .0001). 
      Professors with h-indices < 10 compared to those with h-indices > 10 were 
      significantly less likely to receive NIH funding (odds ratio, 0.07; P = .0321). 
      However, h-indices > 10 were not significantly predictive of greater funding. No 
      significant relationships were observed between h-index and the number of grant 
      awards, years of prior funding, the amounts of grant awards, or grant 
      classification. CONCLUSION: Having obtained at least one NIH grant was associated 
      with a higher h-index, yet multiple or large grants, such as those for program 
      projects, were not predictive of higher h-indices.
