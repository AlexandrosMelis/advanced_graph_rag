AB  - AIM: Colorectal resection is frequently performed during cytoreductive surgery 
      for gynaecological malignancy. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of 
      colorectal anastomosis, and especially low rectal anastomosis, in the absence of 
      a protective stoma in patients with gynaecological cancer and peritoneal 
      metastasis. METHOD: Patient data were retrospectively collected from a database 
      for gynaecological cancer procedures carried out between January 2013 and July 
      2015. All patients who underwent a colorectal resection during cytoreduction were 
      included in the study. The primary outcome was anastomotic leakage in the 
      presence or absence of a diverting stoma. Secondary outcome parameters were 
      complications and reoperations. RESULTS: In the period of study, 43 major 
      colorectal procedures were performed on 37 women. The most common colorectal 
      procedure was low rectal resection (n = 22; 59%) followed by anterior rectal 
      resection (n = 7; 19%) and sigmoid resection (n = 4; 11%). Five (14%) patients 
      underwent Hartmann's procedure. In three (8%) patients, a diverting loop 
      ileostomy was created. CONCLUSION: Low rectal resection during debulking 
      procedures for gynaecological cancers with peritoneal carcinomatosis can safely 
      be performed by an experienced surgeon without a diverting stoma.
