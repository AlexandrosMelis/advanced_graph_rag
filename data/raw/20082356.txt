TI  - Should direct mesocolon invasion be included in T4 for the staging of gastric 
      cancer?
PG  - 205-8
LID - 10.1002/jso.21476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: One of the sites most frequently invaded by gastric 
      cancer is the mesocolon; however, the UICC does not mention this anatomical site 
      as an adjacent structure involved in gastric cancer. The purpose of this study 
      was to characterize and classify mesocolon invasion from gastric cancer. METHODS: 
      We examined 806 patients who underwent surgery for advanced gastric carcinoma 
      from 1992 to 2007 at the Department of Surgery, Gangnam Severance Hospital, 
      Korea. Among these, patients who showed macroscopically direct invasion into the 
      mesocolon were compared to other patients with advanced gastric cancer. RESULTS: 
      The curability, number and extent of nodal metastasis, and the survival of the 
      mesocolon invasion group were significantly worse than these factors in the T3 
      group. However, the survival of the mesocolon invasion group after curative 
      resection was much better than that of patients who had incurable factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of 
      gastric cancer.
