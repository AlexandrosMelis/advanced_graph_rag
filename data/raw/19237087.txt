TI  - Are many colorectal cancers due to missed adenomas?

AB  - BACKGROUND: An unknown number of colorectal cancers could be due to missed 
      adenomas during previous endoscopy. Data in the literature are sparse. A large 
      cross-sectional study was done in a prospective database of all patients 
      diagnosed with colorectal cancer. METHODS: All consecutive endoscopies over a 
      period of 15 years, in which colorectal cancer was diagnosed were included. All 
      patients who underwent more than one endoscopy and in whom ultimately cancer was 
      diagnosed were studied separately. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 
      835 patients. Twenty-five patients underwent a previous endoscopy without a 
      cancer diagnosis. These 25 patients were divided into three groups according to 
      the time between the endoscopy in which the cancer was detected and the previous 
      endoscopy. Five out of these 25 patients underwent regular surveillance. Only 11 
      patients had no argument for regular follow-up. Assuming that these cancers 
      developed from an adenoma than only 11 out of 835 (1.3%) cancers were missed in 
      the adenoma phase. There was no difference in the size of the tumour between the 
      three groups of patients. CONCLUSION: In normal daily practice, only a small 
      number of clinically important adenomas are missed. The problem of missed 
      adenomas probably is being exaggerated.
