AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between knee extensor strength, postural 
      stability, functional ambulation, and disease severity in Parkinson's disease 
      (PD). DESIGN: A cohort study. SETTING: University research laboratory. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=44) with idiopathic PD. INTERVENTION: Not applicable. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were evaluated on their isokinetic knee 
      extensor strength. Additionally, participants completed an assessment of their 
      postural stability (Functional Reach Test for static stability and a dynamic 
      postural stability assessment as measured by the center of pressure-center of 
      mass moment arm during gait initiation). Participants also underwent an 
      evaluation of their functional ambulation as measured by a 6-minute walk test. 
      Lastly, participants were evaluated by a neurologist specially trained in 
      movement disorders to assess neurologic status and disease severity using the 
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Hoehn and Yahr disability score. 
      RESULTS: Knee extensor strength positively correlated with dynamic postural 
      stability and negatively correlated with disease severity. Further, dynamic 
      postural stability was negatively correlated to disease severity and positively 
      correlated with functional ambulation in this cohort of patients with PD (P<.05). 
      The results also suggest that the Functional Reach Test may be a valuable 
      assessment tool to examine postural stability in PD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      suggest a malleable relationship between knee extensor strength, dynamic 
      stability, and disease severity in PD. Although strength is only one piece of the 
      puzzle in the functional outcome of PD, these findings may assist clinicians in 
      designing appropriate interventions aimed at increasing function and decreasing 
      fall risk in PD.
