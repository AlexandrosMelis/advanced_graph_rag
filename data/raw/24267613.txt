AB  - BACKGROUND: In this prospective non randomized observational cohort study we have 
      evaluated the influence of age on outcome of laparoscopic total fundoplication 
      for GERD. METHODS: Six hundred and twenty consecutive patients underwent total 
      laparoscopic fundoplication for GERD. Five hundred and twenty-four patients were 
      younger than 65 years (YG), and 96 patients were 65 years or older (EG). The 
      following parameters were considered in the preoperative and postoperative 
      evaluation: presence, duration, and severity of GERD symptoms, presence of a 
      hiatal hernia, manometric and 24 hour pH-monitoring data, duration of operation, 
      incidence of complications and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Elderly patients 
      more often had atypical symptoms of GERD and at manometric evaluation had a 
      higher rate of impaired esophageal peristalsis in comparison with younger 
      patients. The duration of the operation was similar between the two groups. The 
      incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications was low and the 
      difference was not statistically significant between the two groups. An excellent 
      outcome was observed in 93.0% of young patients and in 88.9% of elderly patients 
      (p = NS). CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic antireflux surgery is a safe and effective 
      treatment for GERD even in elderly patients, warranting low morbidity and 
      mortality rates and a significant improvement of symptoms comparable to younger 
      patients.
