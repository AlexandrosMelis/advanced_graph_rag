AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical supervision is widely recognised as a mechanism for providing 
      professional support, professional development and clinical governance for 
      healthcare workers. There have been limited studies about the effectiveness of 
      clinical supervision for allied health and minimal studies conducted within the 
      Australian health context. The aim of the present study was to identify whether 
      clinical supervision was perceived to be effective by allied health professionals 
      and to identify components that contributed to effectiveness. Participants 
      completed an anonymous online questionnaire, administered through the health 
      service's intranet. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with community 
      allied health workers (n = 82) 8 months after implementation of structured 
      clinical supervision. Demographic data (age, gender), work-related history 
      (profession employment level, years of experience), and supervision practice 
      (number and length of supervision sessions) were collected through an online 
      survey. The outcome measure, clinical supervision effectiveness, was 
      operationalised using the Manchester Clinical Supervision Scale-26 (MCSS-26). 
      Data were analysed with Pearson correlation (r) and independent sample t-tests 
      (t) with significance set at 0.05 (ie the probability of significant difference 
      set at P < 0.05). RESULTS: The length of the supervision sessions (r(s) >/= 0.44), 
      the number of sessions (r(s) >/= 0.35) and the total period supervision had been 
      received (r(s) >/= 0.42) were all significantly positively correlated with the 
      MCSS-26 domains of clinical supervision effectiveness. Three individual 
      variables, namely 'receiving clinical supervision', 'having some choice in the 
      allocation of clinical supervisor' and 'having a completed clinical supervision 
      agreement', were also significantly associated with higher total MCSS-26 scores 
      (P(s) < 0.014). CONCLUSION: The results of the study demonstrate that when 
      clinical supervision uses best practice principles, it can provide professional 
      support for allied health workers, even during times of rapid organisational 
      change.
