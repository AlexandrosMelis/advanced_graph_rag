TI  - Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression 
      result in cost savings? Comparing healthcare costs and utilization between 
      second-line treatment options.
PG  - 486-491
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) are used as second-line agents 
      for treatment resistant depression. AAPs can be expensive compared to other 
      treatment options and can cause several side effects. OBJECTIVES: To estimate 
      healthcare costs and utilization of AAPs compared to other second-line agents. 
      METHODS: Observational study using Medicaid claims data (2006-2011). Subjects 
      were depression-diagnosed adult members with at least two prescriptions of 
      antidepressant medications followed by a second-line agent. Gamma generalized 
      linear models (GLM) produced estimates of the difference in mean expenditures 
      among treatment groups after adjusting for individual baseline characteristics 
      using propensity scores. Negative binomial models produced estimates of the 
      difference in number of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. 
      RESULTS: A total of 3910 members received second-line treatment. Treatment groups 
      were AAPs (n = 2211), augmentation agents other than AAPs (n = 1008), and 
      antidepressant switching (n = 691). AAPs resulted in higher mean adjusted 
      pharmacy costs and higher mean adjusted total mental health-related costs. Mean 
      adjusted total healthcare costs and number of inpatient and ED visits were not 
      different among treatments. CONCLUSION: The results show no evidence that AAPs 
      used as second-line treatment for depression results in overall cost savings or 
      lower inpatient and ED visits compared to other treatment strategies.
