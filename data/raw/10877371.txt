TI  - Does head positioning influence anterior chamber depth in pseudoexfoliation 
      syndrome?
PG  - 214-8
AB  - PURPOSE: Phacodonesis can occur in pseudoexfoliation syndrome because of impaired 
      zonular support. This study investigates whether the increased mobility of the 
      lens influences anterior chamber depth in patients with pseudoexfoliation while 
      assuming a prone position. METHODS: Central anterior chamber depth was measured 
      in 39 patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation and elevated 
      intraocular pressure. Patients were placed in a face-up position for 5 minutes, 
      at which time anterior chamber depth and axial length were measured by A scan, 
      and intraocular pressure was measured by Tonopen (Oculab, La Jolla, CA) in both 
      eyes. The measurements were repeated on both eyes after 5 minutes in a face-down 
      position. RESULTS: No significant differences in intraocular pressure or axial 
      length between the prone and supine positions were found in either eye. Anterior 
      chamber depth in eyes with pseudoexfoliation decreased from a mean of 3.08 mm in 
      the supine position to a mean of 2.95 mm in the prone position, whereas mean 
      anterior chamber depth in the fellow eyes decreased from 3.01 mm to 2.97 mm. The 
      decrease in anterior chamber depth when facing down in the eyes with 
      pseudoexfoliation was significantly greater than in the fellow eyes. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In patients with clinically apparent unilateral pseudoexfoliation, the lens seems 
      to be more mobile in the affected eye. This results in a shallower anterior 
      chamber when the head is placed in a prone position. Whether this fact might 
      potentially lead to transient pupillary block when engaging in activities such as 
      facing down while reading warrants further study.
