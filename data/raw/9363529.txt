TI  - Does psychological distress predict disability?
PG  - 1063-70
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate psychological distress as a predictor of disability 
      due to common chronic disorders. STUDY POPULATION AND METHODS: A 10-year 
      follow-up study was carried out among a representative cohort (N = 8655) of 18-64 
      year old Finnish farmers, who had participated in a health survey in 1979 and 
      were able to work at baseline. A record linkage with the nationwide register of 
      the Social Insurance Institution was made to identify disability pensions granted 
      between 1980 and 1990 in the cohort. The medical certificates of 1004 (11.6%) 
      prematurely retired farmers were reviewed to confirm and classify disabling 
      conditions. A sum score based on self-reports of 11 symptoms at the baseline was 
      used as a measure of psychological distress. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, 
      sex, smoking and body mass index, the cause-specific relative risks (RR) (95% 
      confidence intervals [CI]) of disability in the highest quartile of the 
      psychological distress score as compared with the lowest quartile were for 
      myocardial infarction 2.34 (95% CI: 1.17-4.69), for depression 2.50 (95% CI: 
      1.09-5.72), for neck-shoulder disorders 1.98 (95% CI: 1.26-3.11), for unspecified 
      low-back disorders 1.76 (95% CI: 1.24-2.49), for knee osteoarthritis 1.55 (95% 
      CI: 0.91-2.63) and for trip osteoarthritis 0.89 (95% CI: 0.42-1.85). The 
      corresponding RR for overall disability was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.44-2.14) in the 
      highest quartile of psychological distress score as compared with the lowest 
      quartile. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress is an independent risk factor for 
      disability. Its predictive significance varies between disorders leading to 
      functional deterioration. The association mechanisms are likely to vary from one 
      disorder to another.
