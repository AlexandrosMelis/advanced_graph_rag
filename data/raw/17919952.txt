TI  - Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to 
      somatisation? A population based study.
PG  - 501-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: (i) To examine the association between self-reported mechanical 
      factors and chronic oro-facial pain. (ii) To test the hypothesis that this 
      relationship could be explained by: (a) reporting of psychological factors, (b) 
      common association of self-reported mechanical factors with other unexplained 
      syndromes. METHODS: A population based cross-sectional study of 4200 randomly 
      selected adults registered with a General Medical Practice in North West, 
      England. The study examined the association of chronic oro-facial pain with a 
      variety of self-reported mechanical factors: teeth grinding, facial trauma, 
      missing teeth and the feeling that the teeth did not fit together properly. 
      Information was also collected on demographic factors, psychological factors and 
      the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes. RESULTS: An adjusted 
      response rate of 72% was achieved. Only two mechanical factors: teeth grinding 
      (odds ratio (OR) 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.0) and facial trauma (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.3-2.9) 
      were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for 
      psychological factors. However, these factors were also commonly associated with 
      the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes: teeth grinding (odds 
      ratio (OR) 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), facial trauma (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.7-2.6). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported mechanical factors associated with chronic oro-facial 
      pain are confounded, in part, by psychological factors and are equally common 
      across other frequently unexplained syndromes. They may represent another feature 
      of somatisation. Therefore the use of extensive invasive therapy such as occlusal 
      adjustments and surgery to change mechanical factors may not be justified in many 
      cases.
