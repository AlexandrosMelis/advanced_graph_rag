AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of the 80-hour workweek restrictions on 
      resident education within surgical programs in the New England area. DESIGN: 
      Web-based survey. SETTING: All Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical 
      Education (ACGME) accredited surgical residency programs in New England (n = 20). 
      PARTICIPANTS: Program directors/coordinators in each surgical residency program 
      in New England. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: First, American Board of Surgery 
      In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores and the passing rate of the ABS 
      certifying examination were recorded for the years 2001, 2002, 2005, and 2006. 
      Second, the changes in the curriculum of surgical education were documented as 
      perceived by program coordinators and directors. RESULTS: In all, 85% (17/20) of 
      surgical programs in New England responded to the survey. The programs began to 
      implement the 80-hour workweek from 2002 to 2004. An equal distribution of 
      community (n = 8) and university programs (n = 9) was sampled. Prior to the 
      initiation of the 80-hour workweek, residency programs emphasized weekly didactic 
      sessions given by attending physicians (88%), mock orals (88%), and conventional 
      journal club (76%). After the 80-hour workweek was implemented, the education 
      curriculum most often consisted of didactic sessions by attending (100%), mock 
      orals (88%), and simulation laboratories (75%). No difference was observed in 
      ABSITE scores and first-time pass rates of the ABS examination before or after 
      the introduction of the 80-hour workweek (20% response). Only 25% of programs 
      felt that surgical education was improved after the implementation of the 80-hour 
      workweek, whereas 31% felt education was worse. Overall, 44% of respondents 
      believed that there was no difference in surgical education. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 
      the positive effects the 80-hour workweek has had on resident quality of life and 
      patient care, it does not seem that either significant improvements or 
      detrimental effects have occurred on surgical education within residency programs 
      in New England.
