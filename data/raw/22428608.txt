AB  - AIMS: We explored whether QT corrected dispersion (QTcD) can identify left 
      ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensives. METHODS: We enrolled 100 
      hypertensive patients (study group) and 30 normotensive subjects (control group). 
      Echocardiography was performed to measure left ventricular mass and left 
      ventricular mass index. Electrocardiogram was performed to measure QTcD. RESULTS: 
      LVH was present in 42 patients (42%) of the study group, none among controls. 
      Hypertensive patients had significantly greater indices of LVH and QTcD compared 
      with controls (p <0.001 for all). Similarly, among hypertensive patients, those 
      with LVH had a significantly greater QTcD compared with those without (p <0.001). 
      Pearson's correlation coefficient test demonstrated strongly positive 
      correlations between QTcD and the indices of LVH (p <0.001 for all). Analysis of 
      the receiver operating characteristic curves identified 60 ms as the optimal 
      cut-off value of QTcD that best predicts LVH in hypertensives. Using this value, 
      QTcD was able to predict LVH with a sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity 98.2%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: QTcD is significantly increased in hypertensive patients with LVH 
      compared with those without, being strongly correlated with the indices of LVH. A 
      QTcD cut-off value of 60 ms predicted LVH in hypertensive patients with a high 
      sensitivity and specificity.
