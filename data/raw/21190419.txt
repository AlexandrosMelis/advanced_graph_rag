TI  - Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset 
      during pregnancy?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study was planned to evaluate whether increased nuchal 
      translucency (NT) thickness in the first trimester of gestation can be related to 
      onset of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) during pregnancy. METHODS: From 
      January 2006 to August 2008, a group of 678 singleton pregnancies who had 
      developed GDM has been selected as a study group among a total of 3966 pregnant 
      women who had undergone first trimester screening for aneuploidies at 11-14 weeks 
      of gestation. A group of 420 single pregnant women with physiological pregnancy 
      were enrolled as control group. Both fetal structural and karyotype's anomalies 
      were excluded in the two groups. NT was mesured by a Fetal Medicine Foundation 
      certificated operator; GDM was diagnosed at 24-28 weeks of gestation following 
      Carpenter and Coustan criteria. In the analyses of continuos variables, study and 
      control group were compared by Student's t-test and Anova test. RESULTS: There 
      was no significative difference (p = 0.585) between NT values in the study (mean 
      = 1.56) and control group (mean = 1.54). CONCLUSIONS: NT thickness does not show 
      a significative increase in those women who subsequently develop GDM. Therefore, 
      NT assessment does not prove to be an useful ultrasound parameter for predicting 
      GDM onset during pregnancy.
