TI  - Are there risk factors that increase the rate of staple line leakage in patients 
      undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is currently being performed 
      with increasing frequency worldwide. It offers an excellent weight loss and 
      resolution of comorbidities in the short term with a very low incidence of 
      complications. However, the ever present risk of a staple line leak is still a 
      major concern. METHODS: Since 2005, data from obese patients that undergo 
      bariatric procedures in Germany are prospectively registered in an online 
      database and analyzed at the Institute of Quality Assurance in Surgical Medicine. 
      For the current analysis, all patients that had undergone primary sleeve 
      gastrectomy for morbid obesity within a 7-year period were considered. RESULTS: 
      Using the GBSR, data from 5.400 LSGs were considered for analysis. Staple line 
      leak rate decreased during the study period from 6.5 to 1.4 %. Male gender, 
      higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation 
      time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative 
      complications were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate. On 
      multivariate analysis, operation time and year of procedure only had a 
      significant impact on staple line leak rate. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the 
      current study demonstrated that there are factors that increase the risk of a 
      leakage which would enable surgeons to define risk groups, to more carefully 
      select patients, and to offer a closer follow-up during the postoperative course 
      with early recognition and adequate treatment. All future efforts should be 
      focused on a further reduction of serious complications to make the LSG a widely 
      accepted and safer procedure.
