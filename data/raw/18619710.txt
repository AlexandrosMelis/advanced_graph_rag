AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To be able to adhere to discharge instructions after a visit to 
      the emergency department (ED), patients should understand both the care that they 
      received and their discharge instructions. The objective of this study is to 
      assess, at discharge, patients' comprehension of their ED care and instructions 
      and their awareness of deficiencies in their comprehension. METHODS: We conducted 
      structured interviews of 140 adult English-speaking patients or their primary 
      caregivers after ED discharge in 2 health systems. Participants rated their 
      subjective understanding of 4 domains: (1) diagnosis and cause; (2) ED care; (3) 
      post-ED care, and (4) return instructions. We assessed patient comprehension as 
      the degree of agreement (concordance) between patients' recall of each of these 
      domains and information obtained from chart review. Two authors scored each case 
      independently and discussed discrepancies before providing a final concordance 
      rating (no concordance, minimal concordance, partial concordance, near 
      concordance, complete concordance). RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of patients 
      demonstrated deficient comprehension (less than complete concordance) in at least 
      1 domain; 51% of patients, in 2 or more domains. Greater than a third of these 
      deficiencies (34%) involved patients' understanding of post-ED care, whereas only 
      15% were for diagnosis and cause. The majority of patients with comprehension 
      deficits failed to perceive them. Patients perceived difficulty with 
      comprehension only 20% of the time when they demonstrated deficient 
      comprehension. CONCLUSION: Many patients do not understand their ED care or their 
      discharge instructions. Moreover, most patients appear to be unaware of their 
      lack of understanding and report inappropriate confidence in their comprehension 
      and recall.
