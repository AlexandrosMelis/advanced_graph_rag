TI  - Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease?
PG  - 73-80
AB  - PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary degenerative disease that 
      progressively affects all brain functions, with devastating consequences for the 
      patient, the patient's family and society. Rest regional cerebral blood flow 
      (rCBF) could have a strategic role in differentiating between AD patients and 
      normal controls, but its use for this purpose has a low discriminatory capacity. 
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the diagnostic sensitivity of 
      rCBF single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) could be increased by 
      using an episodic memory task provocation, i.e. memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT 
      (MP-SPECT). METHODS: Eighteen persons (73.2+/-4.8 years) with mild AD and 18 
      healthy elderly (69.4+/-3.9 years) were included in the study. The subjects were 
      injected with (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime (HMPAO) during memory 
      provocation with faces and names, followed by an rCBF-SPECT study. The rCBF 
      (99m)Tc-HMPAO SPECT images were analysed using statistical parametric mapping 
      (SPM2). Peaks with a false discovery rate corrected value of 0.05 were considered 
      significant. RESULTS: On MP-SPECT, the AD group showed a significant rCBF 
      reduction in the left parietal cortex in comparison with healthy elderly. At 
      rest, no significant group differences were seen. CONCLUSION: Memory provocation 
      increased the sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT for the detection of AD-related blood 
      flow changes in the brain at the group level. Further studies are needed to 
      evaluate MP-SPECT as a diagnostic tool at the individual level. If a higher 
      sensitivity for AD at the individual level is verified in future studies, a 
      single MP-SPECT study might be sufficient in the clinical setting.
