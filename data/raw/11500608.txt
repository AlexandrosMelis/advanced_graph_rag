TI  - Does short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors cause rebound aggravation 
      of symptoms?
PG  - 206-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rebound acid hypersecretion might occur after treatment with proton 
      pump inhibitors. This study looks for a rebound aggravation of symptoms after 
      short-term treatment with lansoprazole. STUDY: Sixty-two patients (19 men and 43 
      women; mean age, 54 years; range, 32-77 years) with heartburn and regurgitation 
      and normal upper endoscopy findings were studied in a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled trial with a crossover design. There were two 5-day treatment 
      periods with lansoprazole 60 mg once daily or placebo in random order, separated 
      by a 9-day washout period. Reflux, total, and antacid scores were calculated for 
      each of the treatment periods. Higher scores during the placebo period in the 
      group given lansoprazole first than in the group given placebo first indicated a 
      rebound aggravation of symptoms. RESULTS: The mean symptom scores during the 
      placebo period in the groups given lansoprazole first and placebo first were as 
      follows: reflux score, 21.5 and 17.6, respectively (not significant); total 
      score, 11.2 and 10.3, respectively (not significant); and antacid score, 8.2 and 
      7.2, respectively (not significant). CONCLUSIONS: There is no indication of a 
      rebound aggravation of symptoms 12 to 14 days after a 5-day treatment with 
      lansoprazole 60 mg once daily in patients with reflux symptoms.
