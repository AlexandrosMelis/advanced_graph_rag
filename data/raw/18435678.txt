TI  - Kell alloimmunization in pregnancy: associated with fetal thrombocytopenia?
PG  - 66-9

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Kell haemolytic disease in pregnancies has been 
      suggested to be associated with decreased fetal platelet counts. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the incidence and clinical significance of fetal 
      thrombocytopenia in pregnancies complicated by Kell alloimmunization. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, fetal platelet counts were 
      performed in 42 pregnancies with severe Kell alloimmunization prior to the first 
      intrauterine blood transfusion. Platelet counts from 318 first intrauterine 
      transfusions in RhD alloimmunized pregnancies were used as controls. RESULTS: 
      Fetal thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 150 x 10(9)/l) was found in 4/42 (10%) 
      in the Kell group and in 84/318 (26%) in the RhD group. None of the fetuses in 
      the Kell alloimmunized pregnancies, including 15 with severe hydrops, had a 
      clinically significant thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count < 50 x 
      10(9)/l. In the RhD alloimmunized pregnancies, 2/230 (1%) of the non-hydropic 
      fetuses and 7/30 (23%) of the severely hydropic fetuses had a clinically 
      significant thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSION: In contrast to fetuses with severe 
      anaemia and hydrops due to RhD alloimmunization, fetuses with severe anaemia due 
      to Kell alloimmunization are generally not at risk for substantial 
      thrombocytopenia.
