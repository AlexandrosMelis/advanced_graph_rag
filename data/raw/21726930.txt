AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endometrial polyp is a common cause of abnormal uterine bleeding, but 
      the etiology and pathogenesis remain unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) is angiogenic, related to thick walled vessels and transforming growth 
      factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) is related to fibrotic tissue, which are characteristics of 
      endometrial polyps. The primary objective of this study was to find out if 
      endometrial polyp formation is associated with increased expression of VEGF or 
      TGF-beta1, or both. A secondary objective is to determine if the changes are related 
      to steroid receptor expression. STUDY DESIGN: This prospective study compared 
      VEGF and TGF-beta1 expression of endometrial polyps and adjacent endometrial tissue 
      in 70 premenopausal women. The comparison of results was separately made for 
      endometrium specimens obtained in the proliferative and secretory phases. The 
      results were correlated with the steroid receptors (estrogen receptor and 
      progesterone receptor) expression. RESULTS: The score of VEGF in glandular cells 
      of endometrial polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent 
      endometrium, both in the proliferative phase (P<0.001) and the secretory phase 
      (P=0.03); the score of VEGF in stromal cells of endometrial polyps was 
      significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium only in proliferative 
      phase (P=0.006). The score of TGF-beta1 in glandular cells of endometrial polyps was 
      significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium in proliferative 
      phase (P=0.02); whereas the score of TGF-beta1 in stromal cells of endometrial 
      polyps was significantly higher than the score in adjacent endometrium, both in 
      the proliferative phase (P=0.006) and the secretory phase (P=0.008). There was a 
      significant correlation between the expression of steroid receptors and VEGF and 
      TGF-beta1 (Spearman's correlation P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was increased expression of TGF-beta1 and VEGF in polyps compared to adjacent 
      normal endometrial tissue. It suggested that these cytokines might play a role in 
      endometrial polyp formation. In addition, there was a significant correlation 
      between steroid receptor expression and VEGF and TGF-beta1 expression.
