TI  - Does frozen section alter surgical management of multinodular thyroid disease?
PG  - 179-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frozen section (FS) evaluation during thyroid surgery is often used 
      to guide intraoperative management. We sought to determine the utility of FS in 
      patients undergoing thyroidectomy for multinodular thyroid disease. METHODS: From 
      May 1994 through November 2004, 236 patients with multinodular goiter underwent 
      thyroidectomy at our institution. Patient data were retrospectively analyzed to 
      see if a frozen section was performed during the procedure and whether it changed 
      the patient's outcome. RESULTS: Of the 236 patients, 135 (57%) had 
      intra-operative FS. There were no differences between patients who had FS 
      analysis and those who did not with regard to age, gender, and the incidence of 
      malignancy. Of the patients who had FS, 4/135 (3%) were subsequently diagnosed 
      with thyroid cancer on permanent histology. Three of these FS were misread as 
      benign. Therefore, the sensitivity of FS for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was 
      only 25%. Importantly, in none of the 135 patients did FS alter the 
      intraoperative management. CONCLUSION: While FS was commonly used in patients 
      undergoing thyroidectomy at our institution, in no patient over the last decade 
      did FS correctly alter the intraoperative management. Given the time required to 
      perform FS and the cost associated with it, we believe that routine FS should not 
      be performed in these patients.
