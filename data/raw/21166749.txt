AB  - OBJECTIVE: * Robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) remains controversial in 
      terms of oncologic outcomes, especially during the initial experience. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of initial experience of robotic 
      cystectomy programs on oncologic outcomes and overall survival. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: * Utilizing a prospectively maintained, single institution robotic 
      cystectomy database, we identified 164 consecutive patients who underwent RARC 
      since November 2005. * After stratification by age group, gender, pathologic T 
      stage, lymph node status, surgical margin status, and sequential case number; we 
      used chi-squared analyses to correlate sequential case number to operative time, 
      surgical blood loss, lymph node yield, and surgical margin status. * We also 
      addressed the relationship between complications and sequential case number. We 
      then utilized Cox proportional hazard modeling and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses 
      to correlate variables to overall mortality. RESULTS: * Sequential case number 
      was not significantly associated with increased incidence of complications, 
      surgical blood loss, or positive surgical margins (P= 0.780, P= 0.548, P= 0.545). 
      Case number was, however, significantly associated with shorter operative time 
      and mean number of lymph nodes retrieved (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). * Sequential 
      case number was not significantly associated with survival; however, tumour 
      stage, the presence of lymph node metastases, and positive surgical margins were 
      significantly associated with death. * Although being the largest of its kind, 
      this was a small study with short follow-up when compared to open cystectomy 
      series. CONCLUSION: * Initial experience with RARC did not affect the incidence 
      of positive surgical margins, operative/postoperative complications, or overall 
      survival in a single-institution series.
