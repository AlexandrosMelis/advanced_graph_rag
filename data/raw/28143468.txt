AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior literature identified the use of Performance Measurement 
      Systems (PMS) as crucial in addressing improved processes of care. Moreover, a 
      strategic use of PMS has been found to enhance quality, compared to non-strategic 
      use, although a clear understanding of this linkage is still to be achieved. This 
      paper deals with the test of direct and indirect models related to the link 
      between the strategic use of PMS and the level of improved processes in health 
      care organizations. Indirect models were mediated by the degree of perceived 
      managerial discretion. METHODS: A PLS analysis on a survey of 97 Italian managers 
      working for health care organizations in the Lombardy region was conducted. The 
      response rate was 77.6%. RESULTS: The strategic use of PMS in health care 
      organizations directly and significantly (p < 0.001) enhances performance in 
      terms of improved processes. Perceived managerial discretion is positively and 
      significantly (p < 0.001) affected by the strategic use of PMS, whereas the 
      mediation effect is non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes to the 
      literature investigating the design and implementation of a non-financial 
      measurement tool, such as the non-financial information included into a balanced 
      scorecard (BSC), in health care organizations. Managers in health care 
      organizations can benefit from the strategic use of PMS to effectively allocate 
      their time to strategic opportunities and threats, which might arise and affect 
      organizational, output-related performance, such as improving processes.
