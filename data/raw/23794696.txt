AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of bracket-ligature combination on the 
      amount of orthodontic space closure over three months. DESIGN: Randomized 
      clinical trial with three parallel groups. SETTING: A hospital orthodontic 
      department (Chesterfield Royal Hospital, UK). PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients 
      requiring upper first premolar extractions. METHODS: Informed consent was 
      obtained and participants were randomly allocated into one of three groups: (1) 
      conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and elastomeric ligatures; (2) 
      conventional pre-adjusted edgewise brackets and Super Slick((R)) low friction 
      elastomeric ligatures; (3) Damon 3MX((R)) passive self-ligating brackets. Space 
      closure was undertaken on 0.019x0.025-inch stainless steel archwires with 
      nickel-titanium coil springs. Participants were recalled at four weekly 
      intervals. Upper alginate impressions were taken at each visit (maximum three). 
      The primary outcome measure was the mean amount of space closure in a 3-month 
      period. RESULTS: A one-way ANOVA was undertaken [dependent variable: mean space 
      closure (mm); independent variable: group allocation]. The amount of space 
      closure was very similar between the three groups (1 mm per 28 days); however, 
      there was a wide variation in the rate of space closure between individuals. The 
      differences in the amount of space closure over three months between the three 
      groups was very small and non-significant (P = 0.718). CONCLUSION: The hypothesis 
      that reducing friction by modifying the bracket/ligature interface increases the 
      rate of space closure was not supported. The major determinant of orthodontic 
      tooth movement is probably the individual patient response.
