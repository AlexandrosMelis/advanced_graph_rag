AB  - PURPOSE: This clinical study investigated whether the vascular-guided multilayer 
      preauricular approach (VMPA) to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) could improve 
      access and decrease complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective 
      evaluation consisted of a consecutive series of patients who underwent TMJ 
      surgeries through the VMPA from January through December 2013. Patients with a 
      history of TMJ surgery were excluded. Clinical data, including operating times, 
      subjective complaints of incision scars, functional conditions of the 
      auriculotemporal nerve and facial nerve, and other complications, were recorded 
      and analyzed. All patients in this study were followed for at least 6 months. 
      RESULTS: All patients (606 joints) had successful TMJ surgeries through the VMPA. 
      All incisions healed favorably with an uneventful recovery. No patient developed 
      permanent weakness of the facial nerve or other severe complications. CONCLUSION: 
      The VMPA can provide direct access and favorable visibility to the TMJ region and 
      yield good esthetic and functional results. The VMPA can be considered the 
      approach of choice for common TMJ surgeries.
