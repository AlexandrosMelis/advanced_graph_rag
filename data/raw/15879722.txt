TI  - Is cytokeratin immunoreactivity useful in the diagnosis of short-segment 
      Barrett's oesophagus in Korea?
PG  - 611-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytokeratin 7/20 staining has been reported to be helpful in 
      diagnosing Barrett's oesophagus and gastric intestinal metaplasia. However, this 
      is still a matter of some controversy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic 
      usefulness of cytokeratin 7/20 immunostaining for short-segment Barrett's 
      oesophagus in Korea. METHODS: In patients with Barrett's oesophagus, diagnosed 
      endoscopically, at least two biopsy specimens were taken from just below the 
      squamocolumnar junction. If goblet cells were found histologically with alcian 
      blue staining, cytokeratin 7/20 immunohistochemical stains were performed. 
      Intestinal metaplasia at the cardia was diagnosed whenever biopsy specimens taken 
      from within 2 cm below the oesophagogastric junction revealed intestinal 
      metaplasia. Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was defined as cytokeratin 20 
      positivity in only the superficial gland, combined with cytokeratin 7 positivity 
      in both the superficial and deep glands. RESULTS: Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 
      pattern was observed in 28 out of 36 cases (77.8%) with short-segment Barrett's 
      oesophagus, 11 out of 28 cases (39.3%) with intestinal metaplasia at the cardia, 
      and nine out of 61 cases (14.8%) with gastric intestinal metaplasia. The 
      sensitivity and specificity of Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern were 77.8 and 
      77.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern can be a 
      useful marker for the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, although 
      the false positive or false negative rate is approximately 25%.
