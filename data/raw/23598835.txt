      outcomes?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Severe, immediate postprocedural pain and the need for 
      analgesics after vertebroplasty can be a discouraging experience for patients and 
      caregivers. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the presence of 
      severe pain immediately after vertebroplasty predicts short- and long-term pain 
      relief. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A chart review was performed to categorize 
      patients regarding pain severity and analgesic usage immediately after 
      vertebroplasty (< 4 h). "Severe" pain was defined as at least 8 of 10 with the 
      10-point VAS. Outcomes were pain severity and pain medication score and usage at 
      1 month and 1 year after vertebroplasty. Outcomes and clinical characteristics 
      were compared between groups by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the 
      Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Of the 429 vertebroplasty procedures identified, 69 
      (16%) were associated with severe pain, and 133 (31%) were associated with 
      analgesic administration immediately after the procedure. The group experiencing 
      severe pain had higher preprocedure median VAS rest pain scores (5 [IQR, 2-7]) 
      and activity pain scores (10 [IQR, 8-10]) compared with patients who did not 
      experience severe pain (3 [IQR, 1-6]; P = .0208, and 8 [IQR, 7-10]; P = .0263, 
      respectively). At 1 month postprocedure, VAS rest and activity pain scores were 
      similar between the severe pain group and the nonsevere pain group (P = .16 and P 
      = .25, respectively) and between the group receiving pain medication and the 
      group not receiving pain medication (P = .25 and P = .67, respectively). This 
      similarity continued for 1 year after the procedure. Analgesic usage was similar 
      among all groups at 1 year postprocedure. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe pain 
      immediately after vertebroplasty have similar long-term outcomes compared with 
      patients without severe pain.
