AB  - PURPOSE: Patients usually complain about numbness in the nasal tip after microfat 
      injections. The present study evaluated the severity of the numbness in the nasal 
      tip after the procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To address the research question, 
      a prospective study of young women was designed and performed at the Beijing 
      Anzhen Hospital. Time was the primary predictor variable. The nasal tip 
      sensation, which was evaluated using objective and subjective assessments, was 
      used as the primary outcome variable. The McNemar-Bowker test (time vs nasal tip 
      sensation) was used to detect statistical significance. RESULTS: A total of 30 
      young women (age 20.04 +/- 3.63 years) were recruited for the present study. The 
      preoperative mean touch threshold value was 3.60 units. One week after the 
      injection, the women experienced a decrease in the touch threshold value by 2.50 
      units. However, the sensation recovered gradually during the follow-up period 
      (1.51 units at week 2, 2.39 units at week 4, 3.01 units at week 8, and 3.35 units 
      at week 12). Significant differences were detected between multiple different 
      measurement points (P < .05). The percentage of those experiencing paresthesia 
      after the microfat injections also gradually diminished to none. CONCLUSION: 
      Postoperative numbness occurs in most patients receiving nasal microfat 
      injections. Partial to complete recovery of nasal tip sensation can be expected 
      to occur over a 3-month period.
