TI  - Should serum pancreatic lipase replace serum amylase as a biomarker of acute 
      pancreatitis?
PG  - 399-404
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum pancreatic lipase may improve the diagnosis of pancreatitis 
      compared to serum amylase. Both enzymes have been measured simultaneously at our 
      hospital allowing for a comparison of their diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: 
      Seventeen thousand five hundred and thirty-one measurements of either serum 
      amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase were made on 10 931 patients treated at a 
      metropolitan teaching hospital between January 2001 and May 2003. Of these, 8937 
      were initially treated in the Emergency Department. These results were collected 
      in a database, which was linked by the patients' medical record number to the 
      radiology and medical records. Patients with either an elevated lipase value or a 
      discharge diagnosis of acute pancreatitis had their radiological diagnosis 
      reviewed along with their biochemistry and histology record. The diagnosis of 
      acute pancreatitis was made if there was radiological evidence of peripancreatic 
      inflammation. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred and twenty-five patients had 
      either elevated serum amylase and or serum pancreatic lipase. The medical records 
      coded for pancreatitis in a further 55 whose enzymes were not elevated. Three 
      hundred and twenty of these had radiological evidence of acute pancreatitis. 
      Receiver operator characteristic analysis of the initial sample from patients 
      received in the Emergency Department showed improved diagnostic accuracy for 
      serum pancreatic lipase (area under the curve (AUC) 0.948) compared with serum 
      amylase (AUC, 0.906, P < 0.05). A clinically useful cut-off point would be at the 
      diagnostic threshold; 208 U/L (normal <190 U/L) for serum pancreatic lipase and 
      114 U/L (normal 27-100 U/L) for serum amylase where the sensitivity was 90.3 cf., 
      76.8% and the specificity was 93 cf., 92.6%. 18.8% of the acute pancreatitis 
      patients did not have elevated serum amylase while only 2.9% did not have 
      elevated serum pancreatic lipase on the first emergency department measurement. 
      CONCLUSION: It is concluded that serum pancreatic lipase is a more accurate 
      biomarker of acute pancreatitis than serum amylase.
