AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the predictive value of distal ureteral diameter (UD) on 
      reflux resolution after endoscopic injection in children with primary 
      vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective 
      review of patients diagnosed with primary VUR between 2009 and 2012 who were 
      managed by endoscopic injection. Seventy preoperative and postoperative voiding 
      cystourethrograms were reviewed. The largest UD within the false pelvis was 
      measured. The UD was divided by the L1-L3 vertebral body distance to get the UD 
      ratio (UDR). One radiologist interpreted the findings of voiding 
      cystourethrography in all patients. Clinical outcome was defined as reflux 
      resolution. RESULTS: Seventy patients were enrolled in this series (17 boys and 
      53 girls). Mean age was 5.9 years (1.2-13 years). Grade III presented in 37 
      patients (53%), and 33 patients (47%) were of grade IV. Mean distal UD was 5.5 mm 
      (2.5-13 mm). Mean UDR was 37.8% (18%-70%). Macroplastique injection was performed 
      in all. Subureteric injection was performed in 60 patients (86%), whereas 
      intraureteric injection was performed in 10 patients. No postoperative 
      complications were detected. The effect of grade, UD, and UDR on success after 
      endoscopic injection was tested. UD and UDR were significant predictors of reflux 
      resolution on logistic regression analysis (P <.007 and .001, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: UDR provides an objective measurement of VUR and appears as a 
      predictive tool of success after endoscopic injection.
