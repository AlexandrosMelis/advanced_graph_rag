TI  - Can we rely on arterial line sampling in performing activated plasma 
      thromboplastin time after cardiac surgery?
PG  - 384-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Arterial catheters are routinely used to sample blood 
      for clotting studies in most cardiothoracic intensive care units. The clotting 
      profile in surgical bleeding after cardiac surgery influences further management. 
      Aspiration and discard of a certain amount of blood from the line, prior to 
      sampling, are assumed to clear heparin contamination. We have investigated this 
      assumption through analysis of the clotting profile by simultaneous arterial line 
      and peripheral venous samples. METHODS: The morning following cardiac surgery, 
      simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous blood samples were taken for 
      activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and international normalized 
      ratio (INR) in 49 randomly selected patients. Also, a thromboelastogram analysis 
      (TEG) (n = 7) was made. A survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units was 
      carried out to determine the practice for the withdrawal of blood for clotting 
      studies. RESULTS: The median arterial APTT ratio value was 1.32 +/- 0.52 as 
      compared to the median peripheral APTT ratio value which was 1.1 +/- 0.24 (P < 
      0.001). INR values were statistically similar by both routes. Heparin 
      contamination was confirmed by TEG which revealed that the R-value for arterial 
      catheter blood samples without heparinase in the cup was higher (406.00 +/- 64.44 
      s) compared with the value for arterial samples with heparinase in the cup 
      (318.28 +/- 47.26s, P < 0.05). The survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care 
      units showed that heparinized arterial lines were by far the commonest ports used 
      for blood withdrawal for the measurement of APTT ratio results. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Samples withdrawn from heparinized arterial lines cannot be relied upon for APTT 
      ratio results.
