AB  - AIM: To determine whether rehabilitation inpatients at high risk of falls receive 
      adequate falls risk assessment, management and handover on discharge as per 
      Australian Best Practice Guidelines. METHODS: Medical records of 121 people who 
      received inpatient rehabilitation were retrospectively screened; records of 50 
      people discharged home and at high falls risk (fall in last 12 months, fall 
      preceding/during admission) were audited. Data extracted included falls risk 
      identification during rehabilitation and in discharge documentation; falls risk 
      factors assessed; and fall prevention strategies implemented. RESULTS: Discharge 
      documentation correctly identified falls risk for just nine of the 50 people. 
      Patients at high falls risk had a median of 8.0 (interquartile range 6-10) of 17 
      risk factors. There was limited evidence of assessment for osteoporosis (n = 8), 
      footwear (n = 4) and visual assessment in the previous 2 years (n = 1). Patients 
      received a median of 6.5 (interquartile range 5-9) out of 16 possible strategies. 
      Common strategies were mobility (n = 48), strength (n = 44) and Personal Activity 
      of Daily Living training (n = 43). For 12 risk factors, if the factor was 
      present, there was evidence of a strategy in more than 80% of records. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was little evidence that people at high risk of falls received 
      systematic falls risk assessment during rehabilitation. When a risk was 
      identified, generally a strategy was implemented. However, failure to assess some 
      risk factors might have limited fall prevention strategies offered. Failure to 
      adequately address risks during hospitalization could contribute to falls 
      post-discharge. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2016; 16: 570-576.
