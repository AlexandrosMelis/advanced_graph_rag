TI  - Do general practitioner hospitals reduce the utilisation of general hospital 
      beds? Evidence from Finnmark county in north Norway.
PG  - 243-6
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess whether populations with access to general 
      practitioner hospitals (GP hospitals) utilise general hospitals less than 
      populations without such access. DESIGN: Observational study comparing the total 
      rates of admissions and of occupied bed days in general hospitals between 
      populations with and without access to GP hospitals. Comparisons were also made 
      separately for diagnoses commonly encountered in GP hospitals. SETTING: Two 
      general hospitals serving the population of Finnmark county in north Norway. 
      PATIENTS: 35,435 admissions based on five years' routine recordings from the two 
      hospitals. MAIN RESULTS: The total rate of admission to general hospitals was 
      lower in peripheral municipalities with a GP hospital than in central 
      municipalities without this kind of institution, 26% and 28% lower for men and 
      women respectively. The corresponding differences were 38% and 52%, when analysed 
      for occupied bed days. The differences were most pronounced for patients with 
      respiratory diseases, cardiac failure, and cancer who are primarily or 
      intermediately treated or cared for in GP hospitals, and for patients with stroke 
      and fractures, who are regularly transferred from general hospitals to GP 
      hospitals for longer term follow up care. CONCLUSION: GP hospitals seem to reduce 
      the utilisation of general hospitals with respect to admissions as well as 
      occupied bed days.
