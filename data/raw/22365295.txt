      radiologists: are prophylactic antibiotics necessary?

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the rate of early infection for totally implantable venous 
      access devices (TIVADs) placed without antibiotic prophylaxis. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: A list of patients who underwent TIVAD placement in 2009 was obtained 
      from the patient archiving and communication system (PACS). This list was 
      cross-referenced to all patients who underwent TIVAD removal from January 1, 
      2009, through January 30, 2010, to identify TIVADs that were removed within 30 
      days of placement. Retrospective chart review was performed to record patient 
      demographics, including age, sex, cancer diagnosis, and indication for removal. 
      Concurrent antibiotic therapy, chemotherapy, and laboratory data before and 
      within 30 days of placement were recorded. Central line-associated bloodstream 
      infections (CLABSIs) were identified using U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
      Prevention (CDC) criteria. RESULTS: There were 1,183 ports placed and 13 removed. 
      CLABSIs occurred in seven (0.6%) patients within 30 days of placement. At the 
      time of TIVAD placement, 81 (7%) patients were receiving antibiotics incidental 
      to the procedure. One patient who received an antibiotic the day of implantation 
      developed a CLABSI. Chemotherapy was administered to 148 (13%) patients on the 
      day of placement. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of early infection without antibiotic 
      prophylaxis before TIVAD placement in the interventional radiology suite is < 1%. 
      Based on these data, use of prophylactic antibiotics for TIVAD placement is not 
      recommended.
