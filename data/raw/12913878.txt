TI  - Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using 
      Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy?
PG  - 75-80
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy (LITT) of rat 
      brains is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability changes. We 
      address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB 
      could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain 
      tissue to treat malignant glioma. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD Fischer 
      rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was 
      analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused 
      with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to 
      analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples. RESULTS: LITT 
      induces an opening of the BBB as demonstrated by locoregional extravasation of 
      Evans blue, C3C, fibrinogen, and IgM. HPLC proved the passage of paclitaxel 
      across the disrupted BBB. CONCLUSIONS: LITT induces a locoregional passage of 
      chemotherapeutic agents into the brain tissue. This is of potential interest for 
      the treatment of brain tumors.
