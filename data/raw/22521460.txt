      eclampsia? A randomized controlled pilot study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The route of delivery in eclampsia is controversial. We hypothesized 
      that adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes may not be improved by early 
      cesarean delivery. STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled exploratory 
      trial carried out in a rural teaching institution. In all, 200 eclampsia cases, 
      carrying >/=34 weeks, were allocated to either cesarean or vaginal delivery. 
      Composite maternal and perinatal event rates (death and severe morbidity) were 
      compared by intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Groups were comparable at 
      baseline with respect to age and key clinical parameters. Maternal event rate was 
      similar: 10.89% in the cesarean arm vs 7.07% for vaginal delivery (relative risk, 
      1.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-3.81). Although the neonatal event rate was 
      less in cesarean delivery-9.90% vs 19.19% (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.25-1.05)-the difference was not significant statistically. 
      CONCLUSION: A policy of early cesarean delivery in eclampsia, carrying >/=34 weeks, 
      is not associated with better outcomes.
