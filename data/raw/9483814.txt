      gemeprost in the 2nd trimester?].
PG  - 621-4
AB  - Uterus-specific synthetic Prostaglandin analogues (gemeprost, sulproston etc.) 
      have been widely employed for termination of pregnancy in the second trimester. 
      Since paracervical anaesthesia may be useful during this procedure, we 
      investigated in this prospective randomised study its impact on the clinical 
      course of abortion and pain especially in the late first and second stage of 
      labour. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 20 women scheduled for elective abortion (fetal 
      reasons) between the 16th and 23rd week of gestation were to be given 1 mg 
      gemeprost vaginally every 6 hours. They were allocated at random: 10 women 
      received only Pethidin intravenously and Butylscopolamine rectally, another 10 
      women were additionally treated by paracervical anaesthesia (2 x 10 ml 0.5% 
      Bupivacain solution) at a cervical dilatation of 2-3 cm. RESULTS: A median of 3 
      gemeprost applications were administered in both groups. In the group without 
      paracervical anaesthesia the median induction to abortion interval was 20 hours 
      (range: 8-44 hours), 13 hours (range: 8-36 hours, NS) resulting for the 
      paracervical anaesthesia group. The intervals from the last application of 
      prostaglandin until abortion and from 3 cm cervical dilatation to abortion were 
      slightly, but not significantly shorter in the paracervical anaesthesia group. 
      The requirement of Butylscopolamine was higher in the latter group (p < 0.05). 
      The requirement of Pethidin and the intensity of pain (measured by pain scale 
      according to Huskisson) especially in the late first stage of labour were not 
      statistically different between both groups. Side effects of paracervical 
      anaesthesia did not occur. CONCLUSION: Paracervical anaesthesia is a method for 
      analgesia during second trimester abortion with a low rate of side effects. It 
      can shorten the duration of last period of second trimester abortion in some 
      cases but has no impact on the perception of pain nor requirement of analgesics 
      and so with only limited benefit in second trimester abortion with vaginal 
      gemeprost.
