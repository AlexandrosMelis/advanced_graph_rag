TI  - Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities: Are they detected by rapid 
      prescreening?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rapid prescreening (RPS) is one of the quality assurance (QA) methods 
      used in gynecologic cytology. The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but 
      mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far 
      specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell 
      abnormalities. METHODS: A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS 
      during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as "review for abnormality" (R) 
      if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of 
      undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be 
      present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then 
      underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given 
      a cytologic interpretation. RESULTS: The final cytologic interpretation was a 
      glandular cell abnormality (>/=AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) 
      were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had 
      histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial 
      lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on 
      RPS. Notably, 11 AGC cases were picked up by RPS only and not by FS and 
      represented false-negative cases; 2 of these showed endometrial adenocarcinoma on 
      histologic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Pap smears with glandular cell abnormalities 
      are often flagged as abnormal by RPS, and this results in a sensitivity of 36.4% 
      (at the AGC threshold). Most importantly, some cases of AGC are detected on Pap 
      smears by RPS only, and this demonstrates that RPS is a valuable QA method.
