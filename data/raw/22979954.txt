AB  - BACKGROUND: The data analysis was conducted to describe the rate of unsuccessful 
      copper T380A intrauterine device (IUD) insertions among women using the IUD for 
      emergency contraception (EC) at community family planning clinics in Utah. 
      METHODS: These data were obtained from a prospective observational trial of women 
      choosing the copper T380A IUD for EC. Insertions were performed by nurse 
      practitioners at two family planning clinics in order to generalize findings to 
      the type of service setting most likely to employ this intervention. Adjuvant 
      measures to facilitate difficult IUD insertions (cervical anesthesia, dilation, 
      pain medication, and use of ultrasound guidance) were not utilized. The effect of 
      parity on IUD insertion success was determined using exact logistic regression 
      models adjusted for individual practitioner failure rates. RESULTS: Six providers 
      performed 197 IUD insertion attempts. These providers had a mean of 14.1 years of 
      experience (range 1-27, S.D. +/-12.5). Among nulliparous women, 27 of 138 (19.6%) 
      IUD insertions were unsuccessful. In parous women, 8 of 59 IUD insertions were 
      unsuccessful (13.6%). The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) showed that IUD insertion 
      failure was more likely in nulliparous women compared to parous women (aOR=2.31, 
      95% CI 0.90-6.52, p=.09). CONCLUSION: The high rate of unsuccessful IUD 
      insertions reported here, particularly for nulliparous women, suggests that the 
      true insertion failure rate of providers who are not employing additional tools 
      for difficult insertions may be much higher than reported in clinical trials. 
      Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a common problem and, 
      if so, to assess if the use of adjuvant measures will reduce the number of 
      unsuccessful IUD insertions.
