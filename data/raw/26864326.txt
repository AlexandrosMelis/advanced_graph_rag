AB  - AIM: We compared two methods of predicting hospital admission from ED triage: 
      probabilities estimated by triage nurses and probabilities calculated by the 
      Glasgow Admission Prediction Score (GAPS). METHODS: In this single-centre 
      prospective study, triage nurses estimated the probability of admission using a 
      100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), and GAPS was generated automatically from 
      triage data. We compared calibration using rank sum tests, discrimination using 
      area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and accuracy with 
      McNemar's test. RESULTS: Of 1829 attendances, 745 (40.7%) were admitted, not 
      significantly different from GAPS' prediction of 750 (41.0%, p=0.678). In 
      contrast, the nurses' mean VAS predicted 865 admissions (47.3%), overestimating 
      by 6.6% (p<0.0001). GAPS discriminated between admission and discharge as well as 
      nurses, its AUC 0.876 compared with 0.875 for VAS (p=0.93). As a binary 
      predictor, its accuracy was 80.6%, again comparable with VAS (79.0%), p=0.18. In 
      the minority of attendances, when nurses felt at least 95% certain of the 
      outcome, VAS' accuracy was excellent, at 92.4%. However, in the remaining 
      majority, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration (+1.2% vs +9.2%, 
      p<0.0001), discrimination (AUC 0.810 vs 0.759, p=0.001) and accuracy (75.1% vs 
      68.9%, p=0.0009). When we used GAPS, but 'over-ruled' it when clinical certainty 
      was >/=95%, this significantly outperformed either method, with AUC 0.891 
      (0.877-0.907) and accuracy 82.5% (80.7%-84.2%). CONCLUSIONS: GAPS, a simple 
      clinical score, is a better predictor of admission than triage nurses, unless the 
      nurse is sure about the outcome, in which case their clinical judgement should be 
      respected.
