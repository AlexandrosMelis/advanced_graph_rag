TI  - Do preoperative serum C-reactive protein levels predict the definitive 
      pathological stage in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer?

AB  - PURPOSE: The serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level correlates with the clinical 
      prognosis in patients with kidney, penile and metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer (PC). We prospectively evaluated the preoperative CRP level as a 
      predictive marker for an advanced tumor stage or high-grade cancer in patients 
      with clinically localized PC. METHODS: The study evaluated 629 patients with 
      clinically localized PC who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2010 and 
      2013. Exclusion criteria were signs of systemic infection, symptoms of an 
      autoimmune disease or neoadjuvant androgen deprivation. RESULTS: Poorly 
      differentiated PC tends to be more common in patients with elevated CRP levels 
      (15.5 vs. 9.5%, p = 0.08). Analogously, patients with a Gleason score >/=8 PC had 
      significantly higher median CRP levels than those with a Gleason score </=7 PC (1.9 
      vs. 1.2 mg/l, p = 0.03). However, neither uni- nor multivariate analysis showed 
      an association between the preoperative CRP level and the presence of a locally 
      advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastases or a positive surgical margin. CRP 
      also failed to correlate with the initial PSA level and the clinical 
      tumor-associated findings. Moreover, multivariate analysis relativized the 
      association between an elevated CRP level and poor tumor differentiation. 
      CONCLUSION: In patients with clinically localized PC, CRP does not appear to 
      possess the predictive value and it was shown to have patients with other tumor 
      entities or advanced PC.
