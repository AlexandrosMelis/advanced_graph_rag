TI  - Is delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy related to pylorus 
      preservation?
PG  - 354-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delayed gastric emptying (DGE) is the most frequent postoperative 
      complication after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD). This 
      prospective, non-randomized study was undertaken to determine whether the 
      incidence of DGE may be reduced by modifying the original reconstructive anatomy 
      with a retrocolic duodenojejunostomy towards an antecolic duodenojejunostomy. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was comprised of 51 patients who underwent PPPD 
      between August 1994 and November 1997. The operation was carried out as 
      originally described but was modified by performing the duodenojejunostomy 
      antecolically. Clinical data were recorded prospectively, with special regard to 
      DGE. RESULTS: After PPPD, the nasogastric tube could be removed at a median of 2 
      days (range 1-22 days) postoperatively; in two patients, the nasogastric tube was 
      reinserted because of vomiting and nausea. A liquid diet was started at a median 
      of 5 days (3-11 days); the patients were able to tolerate a full, regular diet at 
      a median of 10 days (7-28 days). The overall incidence of DGE was 12% (n=6). No 
      postoperative complications other than DGE were exhibited by 36 patients (71%). 
      In this group, DGE was only seen in one patient (3%). In the second group, where 
      postoperative complications other than DGE occurred (n=15), five patients (30%) 
      exhibited DGE (P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: DGE after PPPD seems to be of minor 
      clinical importance following uncomplicated surgery. When taking the results into 
      consideration, it can be said that, despite the lack of a control group, 
      antecolic duodenojejunostomy might be the key to a low incidence of DGE after 
      PPPD. In our experience, DGE is linked to the occurrence of other postoperative 
      complications rather than to pylorus preservation.
