TI  - Is lumbar drainage of postoperative cerebrospinal fluid fistula after spine 
      surgery effective?
PG  - 23-7
AB  - AIM: This study is a retrospective consecutive case series analysis of 198 
      patients who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 2010. The aim of this paper 
      was to assess the efficacy and safeness of bed rest and lumbar drainage in 
      treating postoperative CSF fistula. Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      fistula is a well-known complication in spine surgery which lead to a significant 
      change in length of hospitalization and possible postoperative complications. 
      Management of CSF leaks has changed little over the past 20 years with no golden 
      standard advocated from literature. METHODS: Postoperative CSF fistulas were 
      described in 16 of 198 patients (8%) who underwent spine surgery between 2009 and 
      2010. The choice of the therapeutic strategy was based on the clinical condition 
      of the patients, taking into account the possibility to maintain the prone 
      position continuously and the risk of morbidity due to prolonged bed rest. Six 
      patients were treated conservatively (position prone for three weeks), ten 
      patients were treated by positioning an external CSF lumbar drainage for ten 
      days. The mean follow-up period was ten months. RESULTS: All patients healed 
      their wound properly and no adverse events were recorded. Patients treated 
      conservatively were cured in a mean period of 30 days, while patients treated 
      with CSF drainage were cured in a mean period of 10 days. CONCLUSION: Lumbar 
      drainage seems to be effective and safe both in preventing CSF fistula in cases 
      of large dural tears and debilitated/irradiated patients and in treating CSF 
      leaks.
