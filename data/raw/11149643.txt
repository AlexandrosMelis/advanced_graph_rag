TI  - Is semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a 
      short venous bypass in case of insufficient venous material an acceptable 
      alternative for limb-threatening ischemia?
PG  - 753-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to analyse the results of infragenual 
      arterial revascularisation using semiclosed endarterectomy of the superficial 
      femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass in patients with critical leg 
      ischemia and insufficient venous material for a straightforward femorocrural 
      reconstruction. METHODS: From December 1990 through December 1998 thirty patients 
      were studied (22 males and 8 females; mean age 65 years, range 31-92 years). The 
      mean follow-up was 26 months (range 1-96 months). Cumulative primary patency and 
      limb salvage rates were calculated according to life-table analysis. RESULTS: The 
      cumulative primary patency was 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years. The limb 
      salvage rate was 68.6% at 1 and at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      limb-threatening ischemia and lack of venous material for a straightforward 
      venous femorocrural bypass, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral 
      artery combined with a short popliteo-crural bypass provides a good alternative.
