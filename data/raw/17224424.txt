TI  - Effects of exercise training on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young 
      individuals: are there gender differences?
PG  - 55-60
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of exercise training 
      on heart rate, QT interval, and on the relation between ventricular 
      repolarization and heart rate in men and women. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 24 h 
      Holter recording was obtained in 80 healthy subjects (40 males) who differed for 
      the degree of physical activity. Trained individuals showed a lower heart rate 
      and a higher heart rate variability than sedentary subjects, independent of the 
      gender difference in basal heart rate. Mean 24 h QTc was similar in trained and 
      non-trained men, while a significant difference was observed between trained and 
      non-trained women. Exercise training reduced the QT/RR slope in both genders. 
      This effect on the QT/RR relation was more marked in women; in fact, the gender 
      difference in the ventricular repolarization duration at low heart rate observed 
      in sedentary subjects was no longer present among trained individuals. 
      CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular response to 
      exercise training may be different in men and women. Women may benefit more from 
      interventions aimed to increase physical activity as a tool for prevention of 
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
