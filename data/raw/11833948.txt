TI  - Does a delay in transfer to a rehabilitation unit for older people affect outcome 
      after fracture of the proximal femur?
PG  - 547-9
AB  - AIMS: To detemine the relationship between delay in transfer to rehabilitation 
      wards and outcome for patients aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal 
      femur. METHODS: An observational study in a district general hospital of all 
      patients admitted to hospital aged over 75 years with fracture of the proximal 
      femur over 3 1/2 years. Outcome data collected included the number of patients 
      discharged back to their usual residence and total hospital length of stay 
      related to age, gender, usual residence and delay in transfer to a rehabilitation 
      ward. RESULTS: 58% of 455 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation ward. For 
      those patients who were transferred to a rehabilitation ward only age predicted 
      discharge to a more dependent residence. The relative risk for discharge to a 
      more dependent residence for people aged over 85 years compared to younger people 
      was 1.47 (95% CI 1.15-1.88). Delay in transfer to rehabilitation was associated 
      with a longer total hospital length of stay of 0.64 (95% CI 0.23-1.05) days per 
      day of delay in transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Delay in transfer to a rehabilitation ward 
      was associated with a disproportionate increase in total hospital length of stay 
      for patients aged over 75 with fracture of the proximal femur.
