TI  - Do women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of PCOS 
      benefit from short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF? A double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, randomized trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women with ovaries of polycystic morphology (PCO), without any other 
      features of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), respond similarly to women with 
      PCOS when stimulated with exogenous gonadotrophins, and both groups share various 
      endocrinological disturbances underlying their pathology. In women with PCOS, 
      metformin co-treatment during IVF has been shown to increase pregnancy rates and 
      reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). The aim of this 
      study was to investigate whether metformin co-treatment before and during IVF can 
      also increase the live birth rate (LBR) and lower severe OHSS rates for women 
      with PCO, but no other manifestations of PCOS. METHODS: This study was a 
      double-blind, multi-centre, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The study 
      population included 134 women with ovulatory PCO (and no evidence of clinical or 
      biochemical hyperandrogenism) undergoing IVF treatment at three tertiary referral 
      IVF units. The primary outcome was LBR. RESULTS: In total, 134 women were 
      randomized, 69 to metformin and 65 to placebo. There were no statistically 
      significant differences between the two groups in baseline characteristics. With 
      regard to IVF outcome, no significant improvements were found in the metformin 
      group when compared with the placebo group. In particular, there was no 
      difference between the groups in rates of live birth [metformin n = 27 (39.1%), 
      placebo n = 30 (46.2), (95% confidence interval 0.38, 1.49, odds ratio = 0.75)], 
      clinical pregnancy [metformin n = 29 (42.0%), placebo n = 33 (50.8%)] or severe 
      OHSS [metformin n = 6 (8.7%), placebo n = 5 (7.7%)]. CONCLUSIONS: There appears 
      to be no benefit in metformin co-treatment before and during IVF in women with 
      PCO without any other features of PCOS. Clinical Trials.gov: NCT01046032.
