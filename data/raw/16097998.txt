TI  - Is coeliac disease screening in risk groups justified? A fourteen-year follow-up 
      with special focus on compliance and quality of life.
PG  - 317-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: The benefits of serologic screening for coeliac disease in 
      asymptomatic individuals are debatable. AIM: To investigate dietary compliance, 
      quality of life and bone mineral density after long-term treatment in coeliac 
      disease patients found by screening in risk groups. METHODS: The study comprised 
      53 consecutive screen-detected coeliac patients diagnosed 14 years (median) ago. 
      Dietary compliance was assessed by interview, 4-day food record and serology. 
      Quality of life was evaluated by the Psychological General Well-Being and SF-36 
      questionnaires, gastrointestinal symptoms by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating 
      Scale and bone mineral density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Comparisons 
      were made to 44 symptom-detected-treated coeliac patients, 110 non-coeliac 
      subjects and the general population. RESULTS: A total of 96% of screen-detected 
      and 93% of symptom-detected coeliac patients adhered to a strict or fairly strict 
      gluten-free diet. In screen-detected patients, quality of life and 
      gastrointestinal symptoms were similar to those in symptom-detected patients or 
      non-coeliac controls and bone mineral density was similar to that in the general 
      population. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term dietary compliance in screen-detected patients 
      was good. Quality of life and bone mineral density were comparable with those in 
      non-coeliac subjects and the general population. Active screening in coeliac 
      disease risk groups seems to be reasonable rather than harmful.
