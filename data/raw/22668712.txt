TI  - Internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint: is there still a place for 
      ultrasound?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of articular 
      sounds, standardized clinical examination, and standardized articular ultrasound 
      in the detection of internal derangements of the temporomandibular joint. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Forty patients and 20 asymptomatic volunteers underwent a standardized 
      interview, physical examination, and static and dynamic articular ultrasound. 
      Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated using magnetic 
      resonance as the reference test. RESULTS: A total of 120 temporomandibular joints 
      were examined. Based on our findings, the presence of articular sounds and 
      physical signs are often insufficient to detect disk displacement. Imaging by 
      static and dynamic high-resolution ultrasound demonstrates considerably lower 
      sensitivity when compared with magnetic resonance. Some of the technical 
      difficulties resulted from a limited access because of the presence of 
      surrounding bone structures. CONCLUSIONS: The present study does not support the 
      recommendation of ultrasound as a conclusive diagnostic tool for internal 
      derangements of the temporomandibular joint.
