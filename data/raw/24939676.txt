TI  - Does ultrasound-scored synovitis depend on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous 
      anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the 
      pharmacokinetics of s.c. anti-TNF agents on the grade of US-detected synovitis in 
      RA patients. METHODS: Fifty RA patients were prospectively recruited from the 
      Biologic Therapy Unit of our hospital. Inclusion criteria were being in treatment 
      with s.c. anti-TNF agents and having had neither changes in therapy nor local 
      corticosteroid injections in the previous 3 months. Patients underwent clinical, 
      laboratory [28-joint DAS (DAS28) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI)] 
      and US assessment at two time points, i.e. at peak plasma drug concentration and 
      at trough plasma drug concentration. US assessments were performed blindly to the 
      anti-TNF agent, the administration time and the clinical and laboratory data. 
      Twenty-eight joints were investigated for the presence and grade (0-3) of B-mode 
      synovitis and synovial power Doppler signal. Global indices for B-mode synovitis 
      (BSI) and Doppler synovitis (DSI) were calculated for 12 joints and for 
      wrist-hand-ankle-foot joints. B-mode US remission was defined as a BSI <1 and 
      Doppler US remission as a DSI <1. RESULTS: There were no significant differences 
      between the clinical, laboratory and B-mode and Doppler US parameters at peak 
      time and trough time (P = 0.132-0.986). There were no significant differences 
      between the proportion of patients with active disease and those in remission 
      according to DAS28, SDAI, B-mode US and Doppler US at peak time and trough time 
      assessments (P = 0.070-1). CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that s.c. anti-TNF 
      pharmacokinetics do not significantly influence US-scored synovitis in RA 
      patients.
