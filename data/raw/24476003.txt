      sleeve gastrectomy? A randomized trial.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although its excellent results, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy 
      (LSG) presents major complications ranging from 0% to 29%. Among them, the staple 
      line leak presents an incidence varying from 0% to 7%. Many trials debated about 
      different solutions in order to reduce leaks' incidence. No author has 
      investigated the role of gastric decompression in the prevention of this 
      complication. Aim of our work is to evaluate if this procedure can play a role in 
      avoiding the occurrence of staple line leaks after LSG. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Between January 2008 and November 2012, 145 patients were prospectively and 
      randomly included in the study. Seventy patients composed the group A, whose 
      operations were completed with placement of nasogastric tube; the other 75 
      patients were included in the group B, in which no nasogastric tube was placed. 
      RESULTS: No statistical differences were observed between group A and group B 
      regarding gender distribution, age, weight, and BMI. No intraoperative 
      complications and no conversion occurred in both groups. Intraoperative blood 
      loss (50.1 +/- 42.3 vs. 52.5 +/- 37.6 ml, respectively) and operative time (65.4 +/- 
      25.5 vs. 62.6 +/- 27.8 min, respectively) were comparable between the two groups 
      (p: NS). One staple line leak (1.4%) occurred on 6th postoperative day in group A 
      patients. No leak was observed in group B patients. Postoperative hospital stay 
      was significantly longer in group A vs. group B patients (7.6 +/- 3.4 vs. 6.2 +/- 3.1 
      days, respectively, p: 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Routine placement of nasogastric tube 
      in patients operated of LSG seems not useful in reducing leaks' incidence.
