AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and neonatal outcomes among grandmultiparous women 
      to those of multiparous women 30 years or older. METHODS: A database of the vast 
      majority of maternal and newborn hospital discharge records linked to birth/death 
      certificates was queried to obtain information on all multiparous women with a 
      singleton delivery in the state of California from January 1, 1997 through 
      December 31, 1998. Maternal and neonatal pregnancy outcomes of grandmultiparous 
      women were compared to multiparous women who were 30 years or older at the time 
      of their last birth. RESULTS: The study population included 25,512 
      grandmultiparous and 265,060 multiparous women 30 years or older as controls. 
      Grandmultiparous women were predominantly Hispanic (56%). After controlling for 
      potential confounding factors, grandmultiparous women were at significantly 
      higher risk for abruptio placentae (odds ratio OR: 1.3; 95% confidence intervals 
      CI: 1.2-1.5), preterm delivery (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2-1.4), fetal macrosomia (OR: 
      1.5; 95% CI: 1.4-1.6), neonatal death (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3-1.8), postpartum 
      hemorrhage (OR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1-1.3) and blood transfusion (OR: 1.5; 95% CI: 
      1.3-1.8). CONCLUSION: Grandmultiparous women had increased maternal and neonatal 
      morbidity, and neonatal mortality even after controlling for confounders, 
      suggesting a need for closer observation than regular multiparous patients during 
      labor and delivery.
