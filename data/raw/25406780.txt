AB  - BACKGROUND: Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is a potentially serious 
      skin injury that can lead to pressure ulcers (PUs). Multiple studies have 
      indicated the need for evidence to find the most effective skin care protocol to 
      reduce the incidence and severity of IAD in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: 
      To compare the incidence and severity of IAD in two groups on a progressive care 
      unit (PCU) using a defined skin care protocol: cleaning with a gentle cleanser 
      and moisturizer, then applying a skin protectant/barrier. The control group 
      received the skin care protocol every 12 hours and the interventional group 
      received the protocol every 6 hours; both groups also received it as needed. 
      METHODS: A 9-month randomized prospective study was conducted on 99 patients (N = 
      55 in the intervention group and N = 44 in the control group) who were 
      incontinent of urine, stool, or both, or had a fecal diversion device or urinary 
      catheter for more than 2 days. RESULTS: The dermatitis score in the intervention 
      group on discharge was significantly less (7.1%; P </= 0.001) in the moderate IAD 
      group than in the control group (10.9%). The dermatitis score means and P values 
      of each group were compared using a paired t test. CONCLUSION: The researchers 
      studied a defined skin care protocol using a cleanser with aloe vera and a 
      cleansing lotion, followed by application of either a moisture barrier with 
      silicone or skin protectant with zinc oxide and menthol, undertaken at two 
      different frequencies. Data revealed the incidence of moderate IAD was decreased 
      in the experimental group (receiving the skin protocol every 6 hours and p.r.n.).
