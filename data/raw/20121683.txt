TI  - Are patients willing participants in the new wave of community-based medical 
      education in regional and rural Australia?
PG  - 150-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Community-based medical education is growing to meet the increased 
      demand for quality clinical education in expanded settings, and its 
      sustainability relies on patient participation. This study investigated patients' 
      views on being used as an educational resource for teaching medical students. 
      DESIGN: Questionnaire-based survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients attending 
      six rural and 11 regional general practices in New South Wales over 18 teaching 
      sessions in November 2008, who consented to student involvement in their 
      consultation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient perceptions, expectations and 
      acceptance of medical student involvement in consultations, assessed by surveys 
      before and after their consultations. RESULTS: 118 of 122 patients consented to 
      medical student involvement; of these, 117 (99%) completed a survey before the 
      consultation, and 100 (85%) after the consultation. Patients were overwhelmingly 
      positive about their doctor and practice being involved in student teaching and 
      felt they themselves played an important role. Pre-consultation, patients 
      expressed reluctance to allow students to conduct some or all aspects of the 
      consultation independently. However, after the consultation, they reported they 
      would have accepted higher levels of involvement than actually occurred. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients in regional and rural settings were willing partners in 
      developing skills of junior medical students, who had greater involvement in 
      patient consultations than previously reported for urban students. Our study 
      extends the findings from urban general practice that patients are underutilised 
      partners in community-based medical training. The support of patients from 
      regional and rural settings could facilitate the expansion of primary care-based 
      medical education in these areas of workforce need.
