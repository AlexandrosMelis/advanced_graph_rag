      ranges and circumferential indexes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight scales as height squared, which is an observation that forms 
      the basis of body mass index (weight/height(2)). If, and how, circumferences, 
      including waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC), scale to height 
      remains unclear, but this is an important consideration when developing normative 
      ranges or applying WC/height and HC/height as risk indexes. OBJECTIVE: The study 
      aim was to examine the scaling of weight, WC, and HC to height in NHANES 
      (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) III participants. DESIGN: 
      Subjects were adult non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American 
      men (n = 7422) and nonpregnant women (n = 7999) who had complete demographic and 
      anthropometric data. In addition to height, allometric models were developed for 
      each measure that controlled for age, race, and self-reported health status. 
      RESULTS: After adjustment for age and race, weight scaled to height in men and 
      women with mean (+/-SEE) powers of 2.29 +/- 0.11 and 1.80 +/- 0.07, respectively (both 
      P < 0.001). Although univariate circumference-height models were weak or 
      nonsignificant, when adjusted for age and race WC and HC scaled to height with 
      powers of 0.76 +/- 0.08 and 0.45 +/- 0.05, respectively, in men and 0.80 +/- 0.05 and 
      0.53 +/- 0.04, respectively, in women (all P < 0.001). Age- and race-adjusted 
      incremental increases in circumferences ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 cm per centimeter 
      increase in height. Both WC/height and HC/height scaled negatively to height in 
      men and women, and WC/HC scaled negatively to height in women only (all P < 
      0.001). Health status-adjusted models were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Circumferences 
      and related ratios scale significantly to height, notably after adjustment for 
      age and race, across subjects who are representative of the US population. These 
      observations have implications for the clinical and epidemiologic use of these 
      anthropometric measures and indexes.
