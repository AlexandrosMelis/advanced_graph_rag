AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of fenofibrate on sleep apnoea indices. 
      METHODS: Proof-of-concept study comprising a placebo run-in period (1 week, 5 
      weeks if fibrate washout was required) and a 4-week randomized, double-blind 
      treatment period. Thirty-four subjects (mean age 55 years, body mass index 34 
      kg/m 2 , fasting triglycerides 3.5 mmol/L) with diagnosed sleep apnoea syndrome 
      not treated with continuous positive airways pressure were enrolled and 
      randomized to once daily treatment with fenofibrate (145 mg NanoCrystal(R) 
      tablet) or placebo. Overnight polysomnography, computerized attention/vigilance 
      tests and blood sampling for measurement of lipids, insulin, fasting plasma 
      glucose and fibrinogen were performed at the end of each study period. CLINICAL 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT00816829. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: As this was an 
      exploratory study, a range of sleep variables were evaluated. The 
      apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and percentage of time spent with arterial oxygen 
      saturation (SpO(2)) <90% were relevant as they have been evaluated in other 
      clinical trials. Other variables included total apnoeas, hypopnoeas and oxygen 
      desaturations, and non-cortical micro-awakenings related to respiratory events 
      per hour. RESULTS: Fenofibrate treatment significantly reduced the percentage of 
      time with SpO(2) <90% (from 9.0% to 3.5% vs. 10.0% to 11.5% with placebo, p = 
      0.007), although there was no significant change in the AHI (reduction vs. 
      control 14% (95%CI -47 to 40%, p = 0.533). Treatment reduced obstructive apnoeas 
      (by 44%, from 18.5 at baseline to 15.0 at end of treatment vs. 29.0 to 30.5 on 
      placebo, p = 0.048), and non-cortical micro-awakenings per hour (from 23.5 to 
      18.0 vs. 24.0 to 25.0 with placebo, p = 0.004). Other sleep variables were not 
      significantly influenced by fenofibrate. KEY LIMITATIONS: Exploratory study in 
      patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea, limited treatment duration; 
      concomitant hypnotic treatment (35%); lack of correction for multiplicity of 
      testing. CONCLUSIONS: The consistent direction of change in sleep indices in this 
      proof-of-concept study may support further investigation of fenofibrate in 
      moderate to severe sleep apnoea syndrome.
