      pediatric asthma exacerbations?

AB  - BACKGROUND: A short course of systemic corticosteroids is an important therapy in 
      the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. Although a 5-day course of oral 
      prednisone or prednisolone has become the most commonly used regimen, 
      dexamethasone has also been used for a shorter duration (1-2 days) with potential 
      for improvement in compliance and palatability. We reviewed the literature to 
      determine if there is sufficient evidence that dexamethasone can be used as an 
      effective alternative in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations in the 
      inpatient setting. METHODS: A Medline search was conducted on the use of 
      dexamethasone in the treatment of asthma exacerbations in children. The studies 
      selected were clinical trials comparing the efficacy of dexamethasone with 
      prednisone. Meta-analysis was performed examining physician revisitation rates 
      and symptomatic return to baseline. RESULTS: Six completed pediatric clinical 
      trials met the inclusion criteria. All of the pediatric trials found that 
      prednisone is not superior to dexamethasone in treating mild to moderate asthma 
      exacerbations. Meta-analysis demonstrated homogeneity between the dexamethasone 
      and prednisone groups when examining symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned 
      physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Some studies 
      found potential additional benefits of dexamethasone, including improved 
      compliance and less vomiting. CONCLUSIONS: The current literature suggests that 
      dexamethasone can be used as an effective alternative to prednisone in the 
      treatment of mild to moderate acute asthma exacerbations in children, with the 
      added benefits of improved compliance, palatability, and cost. However, more 
      research is needed to examine the role of dexamethasone in hospitalized children.
