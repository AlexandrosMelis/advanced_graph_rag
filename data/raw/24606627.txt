TI  - The objective structured clinical examination: can physician-examiners 
      participate from a distance?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Currently, a 'pedagogical gap' exists in distributed medical 
      education in that distance educators teach medical students but typically do not 
      have the opportunity to assess them in large-scale examinations such as the 
      objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). We developed a remote examiner 
      OSCE (reOSCE) that was integrated into a traditional OSCE to establish whether 
      remote examination technology may be used to bridge this gap. The purpose of this 
      study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site 
      physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new 
      examination method. METHODS: Forty Year 3 medical students were randomised into 
      six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station 
      traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by 
      both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the 
      OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of 
      scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was 
      a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students. RESULTS: Statistically significant 
      correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r 
      = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management 
      stations (r = 0.78). Correlations between LE and RE global ratings were more 
      varied (r = 0.21-r = 0.77). Correlations on three of the six stations reached 
      significance. Qualitative analysis of feedback from REs and students showed high 
      acceptance of the reOSCE despite technological issues. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      preliminary study demonstrated that OSCE ratings by LEs and REs were reasonably 
      comparable when using checklists. Remote examination may be a feasible and 
      acceptable way of assessing students' clinical skills, but further validity 
      evidence will be required before it can be recommended for use in high-stakes 
      examinations.
