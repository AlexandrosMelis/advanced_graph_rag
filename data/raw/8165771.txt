TI  - Ultrasound in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis; a useful addition to clinical 
      staging? A comparison of ultrasound with histopathology.
PG  - 702-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As part of the staging procedure in squamous cell carcinoma of the 
      penis, we assessed the role of ultrasound examination, in particular its role in 
      assessing the extent and the invasion into the corpora. METHODS: From 1988 until 
      1992, all patients referred for primary treatment underwent ultrasound assessment 
      with a 7.5 MHz linear array small parts transducer as part of the clinical 
      workup. All ultrasound images were reviewed by one radiologist, without knowledge 
      of the clinical outcome and were compared with the results obtained at 
      histopathologic examination. RESULTS: In 16 patients the primary tumor and in 1 
      patient a recurrent cancer after primary therapy were examined. All tumors were 
      identified as hypoechoic lesions. Ultrasound examination in the region of the 
      glans was not able to differentiate between invasion of the subepithelial tissue 
      and invasion into the corpus spongiosum, but absence or presence of invasion into 
      the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum was clearly demonstrated. Accurate 
      measurement by ultrasound of maximum tumor thickness was seen in seven of sixteen 
      examinations. CONCLUSIONS: While ultrasound examination is inexpensive and easily 
      done, it is not accurate enough for staging small penile cancers located at the 
      glans penis. However, for larger tumors ultrasound can be a useful addition to 
      physical examination by delineating reliably the anatomic relations of the tumor 
      to structures such as the tunica albuginea, corpus cavernosum, and urethra.
