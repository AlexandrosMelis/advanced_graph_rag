AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is commonly accepted that pathological gambling results from the 
      interaction of multiple risk factors. Among these, dopamine replacement therapy 
      (DRT) prescribed for Parkinson disease can be cited. Another dopamine agonist, 
      aripiprazole, could be a new risk factor. We decided to explore this potential 
      adverse drug reaction (ADR). METHOD: Based on a cohort of 166 pathological 
      gamblers starting treatment in our department, data of each of the 8 patients 
      treated by aripiprazole at inclusion were analyzed. RESULTS: The patients 
      involved were schizophrenic or bipolar, mostly young men with a history of 
      addictive disorders and regular gambling prior to the prescription of 
      aripiprazole. For each one of them, the causality of aripiprazole was considered, 
      using an algorithm. The probability that pathological gambling is actually due to 
      aripiprazole is "possible" in 7 cases out of 8, and "doubtful" in one. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Adverse drug reactions were confronted with other already published 
      case reports. Dopamine partial agonist mechanism of aripiprazole could explain 
      the occurrence of pathological gambling.
