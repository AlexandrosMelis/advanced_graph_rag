AB  - INTRODUCTION: Polio eradication is now feasible after removal of Nigeria from the 
      list of endemic countries and global reduction of cases of wild polio virus in 
      2015 by more than 80%. However, all countries must remain focused to achieve 
      eradication. In August 2015, the Catholic bishops in Kenya called for boycott of 
      a polio vaccination campaign citing safety concerns with the polio vaccine. We 
      conducted a survey to establish if the coverage was affected by the boycott. 
      METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted in all the 32 counties that 
      participated in the campaign. A total of 90,157 children and 37,732 
      parents/guardians were sampled to determine the vaccination coverage and reasons 
      for missed vaccination. RESULTS: The national vaccination coverage was 93% 
      compared to 94% in the November 2014 campaign. The proportion of 
      parents/guardians that belonged to Catholic Church was 31% compared to 7% of the 
      children who were missed. Reasons for missed vaccination included house not being 
      visited (44%), children not being at home at time of visit (38%), refusal by 
      parents (12%), children being as leep (1%), and various other reasons (5%). 
      Compared to the November 2014 campaign, the proportion of children who were not 
      vaccinated due to parent's refusal significantly increased from 6% to 12% in 
      August 2015. CONCLUSION: The call for boycott did not affect the campaign 
      significantly. However, if the call for boycott is repeated in future it could 
      have some significant negative implication to polio eradication. It is therefore 
      important to ensure that any vaccine safety issues are addressed accordingly.
