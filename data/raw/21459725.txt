TI  - Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis: a premalignant condition?
PG  - 179-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is an uncommon variant of 
      chronic cholecystitis, characterized by marked thickening of the gallbladder wall 
      and dense local adhesions. It often mimics a gallbladder carcinoma (GBC), and may 
      coexist with GBC, leading to a diagnostic dilemma. Furthermore, the premalignant 
      nature of this entity is not known. This study was undertaken to assess the p53, 
      PCNA and beta-catenin expression in XGC in comparison to GBC and chronic 
      inflammation. METHODS: Sections from paraffin-embedded blocks of surgically 
      resected specimens of GBC (69 cases), XGC (65), chronic cholecystitis (18) and 
      control gallbladder (10) were stained with the monoclonal antibodies to p53 and 
      PCNA, and a polyclonal antibody to beta-catenin. p53 expression was scored as the 
      percentage of nuclei stained. PCNA expression was scored as the product of the 
      percentage of nuclei stained and the intensity of the staining (1-3). A cut-off 
      value of 80 for this score was taken as a positive result. Beta-catenin 
      expression was scored as type of expression-membranous, cytoplasmic or nuclear 
      staining. RESULTS: p53 mutation was positive in 52% of GBC cases and 3% of XGC, 
      but was not expressed in chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders. p53 
      expression was lower in XGC than in GBC (P<0.0001). PCNA expression was seen in 
      65% of GBC cases and 11% of XGC, but not in chronic cholecystitis and control 
      gallbladders. PCNA expression was higher in GBC than XGC (P=0.0001), but there 
      was no significant difference between the XGC, chronic cholecystitis and control 
      gallbladder groups. Beta-catenin expression was positive in the GBC, XGC, chronic 
      cholecystitis and control gallbladder groups. But the expression pattern in XGC, 
      chronic cholecystitis and control gallbladders was homogenously membranous, 
      whereas in GBC the membranous expression pattern was altered to cytoplasmic and 
      nuclear. CONCLUSION: The expression of p53, PCNA and beta-catenin in XGC was 
      significantly different from GBC and similar to chronic cholecystitis, thus 
      indicating the inflammatory nature of XGC and may not support a premalignant 
      nature of the lesion.
