TI  - Does the central venous pressure predict fluid responsiveness? An updated 
      meta-analysis and a plea for some common sense.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a previous meta-analysis that concluded that central venous 
      pressure should not be used to make clinical decisions regarding fluid 
      management, central venous pressure continues to be recommended for this purpose. 
      AIM: To perform an updated meta-analysis incorporating recent studies that 
      investigated indices predictive of fluid responsiveness. A priori subgroup 
      analysis was planned according to the location where the study was performed (ICU 
      or operating room). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register of 
      Controlled Trials, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles. 
      STUDY SELECTION: Clinical trials that reported the correlation coefficient or 
      area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) between the central 
      venous pressure and change in cardiac performance following an intervention that 
      altered cardiac preload. From 191 articles screened, 43 studies met our inclusion 
      criteria and were included for data extraction. The studies included human adult 
      subjects, and included healthy controls (n = 1) and ICU (n = 22) and operating 
      room (n = 20) patients. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were abstracted on study 
      characteristics, patient population, baseline central venous pressure, the 
      correlation coefficient, and/or the AUC between central venous pressure and 
      change in stroke volume index/cardiac index and the percentage of fluid 
      responders. Meta-analytic techniques were used to summarize the data. DATA 
      SYNTHESIS: Overall 57% +/- 13% of patients were fluid responders. The summary AUC 
      was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58) with no heterogenicity between studies. The summary 
      AUC was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.52-0.60) for those studies done in the ICU and 0.56 (95% 
      CI, 0.54-0.58) for those done in the operating room. The summary correlation 
      coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke 
      volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), being 0.28 (95% CI, 
      0.16-0.40) in the ICU patients, and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.02-0.21) in the operating 
      room patients. CONCLUSIONS: There are no data to support the widespread practice 
      of using central venous pressure to guide fluid therapy. This approach to fluid 
      resuscitation should be abandoned.
