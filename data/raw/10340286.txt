TI  - Is there a role for leukocyte and CRP measurements in the diagnosis of acute 
      appendicitis in the elderly?
PG  - 255-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is still difficult and the 
      results are unsatisfactory in three particular patient groups: in children, in 
      fertile-age women and in elderly patients. As our population ages, the challenge 
      for expedient diagnosis and intervention in older age groups will become more and 
      more significant. The present study aimed at clarifying the role of leukocyte 
      count and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements in the diagnosis of acute 
      appendicitis in the elderly. In particular, are there patients with acute 
      appendicitis but unelevated leukocyte count and CRP? METHODS: Eighty-three 
      consecutive elderly patients underwent appendectomy for suspected acute 
      appendicitis. The mean leukocyte count and CRP value were calculated in patients 
      with an uninflamed appendix (group A) and in those with acute appendicitis (group 
      B). The percentages of patients with: (1) both values unelevated; (2) only 
      leukocyte count elevated; (3) only CRP value elevated; (4) both values elevated 
      were calculated within the groups A and B. RESULTS: There was no statistically 
      significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an 
      uninflamed appendix (group A) and those with acute appendicitis (group B). When 
      the patients were divided into the four subgroups, the most conspicuous finding 
      was that group B (acute appendicitis, n = 73) contained no patients with both 
      values unelevated. CONCLUSIONS: Although elevated leukocyte count and CRP value 
      cannot effectively establish the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, 
      unelevated values exclude it. Accordingly, appendectomy is not recommended to be 
      performed in an elderly patient with unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, 
      although clinical symptoms and signs indicate acute appendicitis.
