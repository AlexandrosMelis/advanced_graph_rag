TI  - Is withdrawal-induced anxiety in alcoholism based on beta-endorphin deficiency?
PG  - 433-7
AB  - RATIONALE: Associations between several psychopathological alterations and 
      lowered beta-endorphin(beta E) plasma levels have already been stated in former 
      studies. However, whereas single measures during static conditions generally 
      failed in linking beta E levels with psychopathology, dynamic changes of beta E 
      in particular have been shown to be associated with spells of anxiety and 
      depression. During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a 
      delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became 
      available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological 
      parameters. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether 
      beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, 
      and craving. METHODS: We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving 
      during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive 
      sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 
      healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the 
      pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and 
      cortisol were also determined. RESULTS: In accordance with prior studies, beta E 
      was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to 
      controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in 
      alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly 
      between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased 
      significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely 
      correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation 
      coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation 
      was largely independent from ACTH. In addition, a significant inverse 
      relationship was found between beta E and craving on day 14 (r=-0.28). No 
      association appeared between beta E and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give 
      first evidence that lowered beta E during alcohol withdrawal may contribute to 
      anxiety as a common disturbance during this state.
