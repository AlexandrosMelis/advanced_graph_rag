      prostatectomy oncologically adequate? Results of a multicentre retrospective 
      study.

AB  - AIM: The management of rectal cancer threatening or affecting the prostatic plane 
      is still under debate. The role of preoperative chemo radiotherapy and the extent 
      of prostatectomy seem to be key points in the treatment of these tumours. The aim 
      of the present study was to evaluate the pathological circumferential margin 
      status and the local recurrence rate following different therapeutic options. 
      METHOD: A multicentre, retrospective study was conducted of patients with rectal 
      cancer threatening or affecting the prostatic plane, but not the bladder, judged 
      by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of preoperative chemoradiotherapy 
      and the type of urologic resection were correlated with the status of the 
      pathological circumferential resection margin (CRM) and local recurrence. 
      RESULTS: A consecutive series of 126 men with rectal cancer threatening (44) or 
      affecting (82) the prostatic plane on preoperative staging and operated with 
      local curative intent between 1998 and 2010 was analysed. In patients who did not 
      have chemoradiotherapy but had a preoperative threatened anterior margin the 
      CRM-positive rate was 25.0%. In patients who did not have preoperative 
      chemoradiotherapy but did have an affected margin, the CRM-positive rate was 
      41.7%. When preoperative radiotherapy was given, the respective CRM infiltration 
      rates were 7.1 and 20.7%. In patients having preoperative chemoradiotherapy 
      followed by prostatic resection the rate of CRM positivity was 2.4%. Partial 
      prostatectomy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy resulted in a free anterior 
      CRM in all cases, but intra-operative urethral damage occurred in 36.4% of 
      patients who underwent partial prostatectomy, resulting in a postoperative 
      urinary fistula in 18.2% of patients. CONCLUSION: Preoperative chemoradiation is 
      mandatory in male patients with a threatened or affected anterior circumferential 
      margin on preoperative MRI. In patients with preoperative prostatic infiltration, 
      prostatic resection is necessary. In this group of patients partial prostatectomy 
      seems to be oncologically safe.
