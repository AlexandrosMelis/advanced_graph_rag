AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare two treatment strategies in preterm infants with or at risk 
      of respiratory distress syndrome: early surfactant administration (within one 
      hour of birth) versus late surfactant administration, in a geographically defined 
      population. OUTCOME: The primary outcome was chronic lung disease (CLD) and 
      mortality before/at 36 weeks. Secondary outcomes included: duration of mechanical 
      ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), post-natal steroids 
      for CLD and major neonatal morbidities. SUBJECTS: Premature infants born at 22-32 
      weeks' gestation between January 2006 and December 2009. SETTING: Ten neonatal 
      intensive care units (NICUs) in New South Wales (NSW) and Australian Capital 
      Territory (ACT), Australia. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively 
      collected data from the regional NICU database in NSW and ACT. RESULTS: Of the 
      2170 infants who received surfactant, 1182 (54.5%) and 988 (45.5%) received early 
      and late surfactant, respectively. The early surfactant group was less mature 
      (27.1 +/- 2.1 versus 29.4 +/- 2.1 weeks) and had more CLD and mortality (40.2% versus 
      20.0%). The multivariable analysis showed early surfactant to be associated with 
      less duration of ventilation, longer duration of CPAP and longer hospital stay 
      but had little or no impact on CLD/mortality. CONCLUSION: Early surfactant 
      administration is associated with shorter duration of ventilation but does not 
      appear to be significantly protective against CLD/mortality among premature 
      infants. This may support the growing evidence for consideration of CPAP as an 
      alternative to routine intubation and early surfactant administration. Further 
      investigation from large randomized clinical trials is warranted to confirm these 
      results.
