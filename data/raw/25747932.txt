AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper uses a life-course approach to explore whether the timing 
      and/or duration of urban (vs rural) exposure was associated with risk factors for 
      NCDs. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among health care workers 
      in two hospitals in Thailand. Two measures of urbanicity were considered: 
      early-life urban exposure and the proportion of urban life years. We explored 
      four behavioral NCD risk factors, two physiological risk factors and four 
      biological risk factors. RESULTS: Both measures of urbanicity were each 
      independently associated with increases in all behavioral and physiological risk 
      factors. For some biological risk factors, people spending their early life in an 
      urban area may be more susceptible to the effect of increasing proportion of 
      urban life years than those growing up in rural areas. CONCLUSION: Urbanicity was 
      associated with increases in behavioral and physiological risk factors. However, 
      these associations may not translate directly into increases in biological risk 
      factors. It is likely that these biological risk factors were results of a 
      complex interaction between both long term accumulation of exposure and early 
      life exposures.
