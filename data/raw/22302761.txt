TI  - Can fractional lasers enhance transdermal absorption of topical lidocaine in an 
      in vivo animal model?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It has been shown in vitro that pretreatment of skin 
      with fractional lasers enhances transdermal delivery of drugs. The aim of this 
      study is to demonstrate in vivo firstly that laser enhances transdermal drug 
      absorption and secondly that this can be manipulated by altering laser settings. 
      STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four pigs were used in the IACUC approved 
      animal study. On day 0, 5 g of 4% topical lidocaine was applied under occlusion 
      for 60 minutes to a 400 cm(2) area on the abdomen. Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 90, 
      120, 180, and 240 minutes. On day 7, the Er:YAG laser was used at 500, 250, 50, 
      and 25 microm ablative depth, respectively, over a 400 cm(2) area on the abdomen. 
      Five grams of 4% topical lidocaine was applied immediately with occlusion for 60 
      minutes, and then removed. Blood was drawn at 0, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 
      minutes. The serum was extracted and analyzed for lidocaine and its metabolite 
      monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX). RESULTS: Serum levels of lidocaine and MEGX were 
      undetectable in untreated skin. Following laser treatment both lidocaine and MEGX 
      were detectable. Peak levels of lidocaine were significantly higher (P = 0.0002) 
      at 250 microm (0.62 mg/L), compared to 500 microm (0.45 mg/L), 50 microm (0.48 mg/L), and 25 
      microm (0.3 mg/L). Peak levels of MEGX were significantly higher (P </= 0.0001) at 250 
      microm (0.048 mg/L), compared to 500 microm (0.018 mg/L), 50 microm (0.036 mg/L), and 25 microm 
      (0.0144 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that laser pretreatment 
      significantly increases absorption of topical lidocaine so that it is detectable 
      in the blood and that manipulating laser settings can affect drug absorption. 
      Future work will look at translating this effect into clinical benefit.
