TI  - Can nonproliferative breast disease and proliferative breast disease without 
      atypia be distinguished by fine-needle aspiration cytology?
PG  - 22-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cytologic criteria reported to be helpful in the distinction of 
      proliferative breast disease without atypia (PBD) from nonproliferative breast 
      disease (NPBD) have not been rigorously tested. METHODS: Fifty-one air-dried, 
      Diff-Quik-stained fine-needle aspirates (FNA) of palpable breast lesions with 
      biopsy-proven diagnoses of NPBD (34 cases) or PBD (17 cases) were reviewed. The 
      smears were evaluated for the cellularity, size, and architectural arrangement of 
      the epithelial groups; the presence of single epithelial cells and myoepithelial 
      cells; and nuclear characteristics. RESULTS: The only cytologic feature found to 
      be significantly different between PBD and NPBD was a swirling pattern of 
      epithelial cells. A swirling pattern was noted in 13 of 17 PBD cases (76%) and 12 
      of 34 NPBD cases (35%) (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Because there is significant 
      overlap in cytologic features between NPBD and PBD, the distinction between the 
      two entities is difficult in cytologic sampling.
