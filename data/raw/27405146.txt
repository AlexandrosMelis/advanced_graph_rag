TI  - [PREVALENCE OF THE STREPTOCOCUS AGALACTIAE IN THE PREGNANT WOMAN FROM THE 
      AUTONOMIC CITY OF MELILLA: IS CULTURE A DETERMINANT FACTOR?].
PG  - 40-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The neonatal infection by Streptococcus group B is one of the main 
      causes of neonatal morbi-mortality rate. For this reason a screening is made to 
      each pregnant woman in order to detect its presence, and if it was the case, to 
      apply an antibiotic treatment during labour. The aim of this study was to know 
      the prevalence of this Streptococcus in the pregnant women from Melilla, as well 
      as the differences according to culture and age. METHOD: A descriptive 
      cross-sectional study located in the Hospital Comarcal from Melilla. RESULTS: The 
      sample is taken from 280 women: 194 are from Muslim culture (69.3%), 68 are from 
      Christian culture (24.3%) and 18 women from unknown cultures (6.4%). Also it is 
      known that 78 of them are 25 years old or less (27.85%), 158 are between 26 and 
      34 years old (56.42%) and 44 are 35 years old or more (15.71%). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      prevalence of vagino-rectal colonization by Streptococcus group B in the pregnant 
      women from Melilla is within the national estimated figures, however it is 
      different if they are from Muslim or Christian culture, being higher in the 
      Muslim population. On one hand both prevalences are within the national 
      statistics, and on the other hand it is observed that there is not any difference 
      according to age.
