TI  - Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?
PG  - 395-8

AB  - PURPOSE: The precise correction of refractive error is especially important in 
      young adults. It is unclear whether cycloplegic refraction is necessary in this 
      age group. The purpose of this study was to compare the non-cycloplegic and 
      cycloplegic spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error measured in young adults. 
      METHODS: This was a prospective study of 1400 eyes (n = 700) of enlisted soldiers 
      aged 18 to 21 years who were consecutively evaluated in an outpatient army 
      ophthalmology clinic. One drop of cyclopentolate 1 % was installed twice 10 min 
      apart, and cycloplegic refraction was performed in both eyes 40 min later using 
      an auto-refractor. The difference between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic 
      refractive measurements was analyzed. RESULTS: The mean difference in SE between 
      non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements was 0.68 +/- 0.83 D (95 % CI, 
      0.64-0.72). Significantly greater differences were observed in hypermetropes than 
      myopes (1.30 +/- 0.90 D versus 0.46 +/- 0.68 D, p < 0.001). Moderate hypermetropes (2 
      to 5 D) demonstrated significantly greater refractive error than mild (0.5 to 
      2 D) or severe (>5 D) hypermetropes (1.71 +/- 1.18 D versus 1.19 +/- 0.74 D and 
      1.16 +/- 1.08 D respectively, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Young hypermetropic adults 
      possessed +1 to +2 D of latent hypermetropia. In contrast, young myopic adults 
      revealed pseudomyopia of -0.5 D. Cycloplegic refraction should be performed in 
      young hypermetropic adults complaining of various signs of asthenopia.
