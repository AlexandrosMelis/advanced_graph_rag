TI  - [Is there awareness of pharmaceutical expenditure in the reformed primary care 
      system?].
PG  - 408-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of feeding information on pharmacy back 
      to primary care doctors in order to create awareness (knowledge) of 
      pharmaceutical expenditure (PE). DESIGN: Retrospective cross-sectional study, 
      through personal interview. SETTING: Reformed PC, Sabadell, Barcelona. 
      PARTICIPANTS: The 80 PC doctors working with primary care teams. INTERVENTIONS: 
      As the personal feed-back on PE, each doctor was asked for the PE generated 
      during 1997 and the mean cost of prescriptions to active and pensioner patients. 
      The statistical test used was the t test to compare means for paired data, with p 
      < 0.05 the required level of significance. RESULTS: Out of the total doctors 
      interviewed (80), 71 replies were obtained for the annual PE and 76 for the mean 
      cost of prescriptions, for both active and pensioner patients. Significant 
      differences were found between the annual PE in reality and doctors' estimates: 
      around twelve million pesetas. The differences between the real mean costs of 
      prescription and the estimates were also significant. CONCLUSIONS: In view of the 
      results, it is concluded that there is no awareness of PE among the doctors in 
      the reformed PC in our area. This poses a question over the efficacy of feed-back 
      of pharmacy information in order to create this awareness. This information needs 
      to be more frequent and richer in content, and to be complemented by other 
      measures.
