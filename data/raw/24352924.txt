AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of 
      ultrasonography to confirm Schanz pin placement in a cadaveric model, and the 
      interobserver repeatability of the ultrasound methodology. DESIGN: This 
      investigation is a repeated measures cadaveric study with multiple examiners. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Cadaveric preparation and observations were done by an orthopaedic 
      traumatologist and resident, and two general surgery traumatologists. 
      INTERVENTIONS: A total of 16 Schanz pins were equally placed in bilateral femora 
      and tibiae. Four examiners took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal 
      cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement after gross 
      dissection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Distal Schanz pin protrusion length 
      measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection. 
      RESULTS: Schanz pin protrusion measurements are underestimated by ultrasonography 
      (p < 0.01) by an average of 10 percent over the range of 5 to 18 mm, and they 
      display a proportional bias that increases the under reporting as the magnitude 
      of pin protrusion increases. Ultrasound data demonstrate good linear correlation 
      and closely represent actual protrusion values in the 5 to 12 mm range. 
      Interobserver repeatability analysis demonstrated that all examiners were not 
      statistically different in their measurements despite minimal familiarity with 
      the ultrasound methodology (p > 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the statistical 
      imparity of pin protrusion measurement via ultrasound compared to that of gross 
      dissection, a consideration of the clinical relevance of ultrasound measurement 
      bias during an austere operating theatre leads to the conclusion that 
      ultrasonography is an adequate methodology for Schanz pin protrusion measurement.
