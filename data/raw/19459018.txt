AB  - AIM: To assess the outcome of patients with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
      (PA) associated with high serum CA 19-9 levels. METHODS: From 2000 to 2007, 344 
      patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy for PA. Fifty-three patients (elevated 
      group) had preoperatively elevated serum CA 19-9 levels (>400 IU/ml) after 
      resolution of obstructive jaundice. Of these, 27 patients had high levels 
      (400-899 IU/ml (HL)) and 26 patients had very high levels >or=900 IU/ml (VHL). 
      Fifty patients with normal preoperative serum CA 19-9 levels (<37 IU/ml) 
      comprised the control group. RESULTS: Median survival of the control group (n = 
      50) versus elevated group (n = 53) was 22 versus 15 months (p = 0.02) and overall 
      3-year survival was 32% versus 14% (p = 0.03). There was no statistical 
      difference in the median and 3-year overall survival between patients with HL and 
      VHL. Patients in the elevated group who normalized their CA 19-9 levels after 
      surgery (n = 11) had a survival equivalent to patients in the control group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients who normalized their CA19-9 levels postoperatively had 
      equivalent survival to patients with normal preoperative CA 19-9 levels. 
      Preoperative serum CA 19-9 level by itself should not preclude surgery in 
      patients who have undergone careful preoperative staging.
