TI  - Hepatic arterial embolization for unresectable hepatocellular carcinomas: do 
      technical factors affect prognosis?

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate retrospectively whether technical factors of hepatic 
      arterial embolization affect the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inclusion criteria of this study were the 
      following: (1) patients received embolization as the initial treatment during 
      2003-2004, (2) Child A or B liver profile, (3) five or fewer HCCs with maximum 
      diameter of 7 cm or smaller, and (4) no extrahepatic metastasis. Patient data 
      were gathered from 43 centers. Prognostic factors were evaluated using univariate 
      and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Eight hundred fifteen patients were enrolled. 
      The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year overall survival rates were 92.0 % (95 % CI 
      90.1-93.9), 62.9 % (95 % CI 59.3-66.6), 39.0 % (95 % CI 35.1-43.0), and 26.7 % 
      (95 % CI 22.6-30.8) in all patients. Univariate analysis showed a Child-Pugh 
      class-A, alpha-fetoprotein level lower than 100 ng/ml, tumor size of 3 cm or 
      smaller, tumor number of 3 or fewer, one-lobe tumor distribution, nodular tumor 
      type, within the Milan criteria, stage I or II, no portal venous invasion, use of 
      iodized oil, and selective embolization were significantly better prognostic 
      factors. In the multivariate Cox model, the benefit to survival of selective 
      embolization remained significant (hazard ratio 0.68; 95 % CI 0.48-0.97; p = 
      0.033). CONCLUSION: Selective embolization contributes to survival in patients 
      with HCCs.
