AB  - BACKGROUND: Establishing a core curriculum for undergraduate Emergency Medicine 
      (EM) education is crucial to development of the specialty. The Clerkship 
      Directors in Emergency Medicine (CDEM) National Curriculum Task Force recommended 
      that all students in a 4(th)-year EM clerkship be exposed to 10 emergent clinical 
      conditions. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility of encountering recommended 
      core conditions in a clinical setting during a 4(th)-year EM clerkship. METHODS: 
      Students from three institutions participated in this ongoing, prospective 
      observation study. Students' patient logs were collected during 4-week EM 
      clerkships between July 2011 and June 2012. De-identified logs were reviewed and 
      the number of patient encounters for each of the CDEM-identified emergent 
      conditions was recorded. The percentage of students who saw each of the core 
      complaints was calculated, as was the average number of core complaints seen by 
      each. RESULTS: Data from 130 students at three institutions were captured; 15.4% 
      of students saw all 10 conditions during their rotation, and 76.9% saw at least 
      eight. The average number of conditions seen per student was 8.4 (range of 
      7.0-8.6). The percentage of students who saw each condition varied, ranging from 
      100% (chest pain and abdominal pain) to 31% (cardiac arrest). CONCLUSIONS: Most 
      students do not encounter all 10 conditions during patient encounters throughout 
      a 4-week EM rotation, although most have exposure to at least eight. Certain 
      conditions are far less likely than others to be encountered, and may need to be 
      taught in a nonclinical setting.
