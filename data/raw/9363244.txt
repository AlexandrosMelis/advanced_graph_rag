TI  - Does occupational nuclear power plant radiation affect conception and pregnancy?
PG  - 130-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of occupational exposure in a nuclear power 
      plant in Griefswald, Germany on male and female fecundity. METHODS: The frequency 
      of men and women exposed to ionizing radiation through work in a nuclear power 
      plant among 270 infertile couples was retrospectively compared to a control 
      fertile population using a pair-matched analysis. The total cumulative equivalent 
      radiation dose was determined. In addition, the spermiograms of the male partners 
      in both groups were compared and correlated to the degree of exposure. RESULTS: 
      No differences were noted in the frequency of nuclear power plant exposure 
      between sterile and fertile groups. There was a higher rate of anomalous 
      spermiograms in nuclear power plant workers. However, abnormalities were 
      temporary. No correlation was found between the cumulative equivalent radiation 
      dose and abnormal spermiograms. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that occupational 
      exposure due to ionizing radiation should be investigated as a possible cause for 
      involuntary temporary sterility and as a risk factor for early pregnancy 
      disorders.
