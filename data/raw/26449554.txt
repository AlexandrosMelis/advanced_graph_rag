TI  - Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP 
      machines in very obese subjects?

AB  - PURPOSE: The pressures delivered by autotitrating continuous positive airways 
      pressure (CPAP) devices not only treat obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) effectively 
      but also give potentially interesting physiological information about the forces 
      impinging on the pharynx. In earlier work from this unit, we used correlations 
      between autoCPAP pressure and both OSA severity and obesity, to construct an 
      algorithm to estimate the fixed CPAP pressure a patient required for subsequent 
      clinical use. We wished to discover if these relationships could be reliably 
      extended to a much more obese group. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort 
      study in an obese population. Measurements of obesity were made, OSA severity was 
      recorded, and the 95th centile autoCPAP pressure was recorded during 1 week of 
      autoCPAP. Spearman's rank correlation was performed between measurements of 
      obesity and autoCPAP pressure, and between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-four obese individuals (median body mass index (BMI) 
      43.0 kg/m(2)), 52 % of whom had OSA (apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) >/= 15), had a 
      median 95th centile autoCPAP pressure of 11.8 cmH2O. We found no significant 
      correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference 
      or BMI. There was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA 
      severity (AHI r = 0.34, p = 0.02; oxygen desaturation index (ODI) r = 0.48, 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference 
      nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the 
      previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure 
      for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some 
      subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation 
      between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.
