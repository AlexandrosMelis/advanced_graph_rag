AB  - PURPOSE: Recent studies have implicated the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as a 
      possible pathogen for causing hypertension. We aimed to study the association 
      between HCMV infection and hypertension in the United States National Health and 
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: We analyzed data on 2979 men and 
      3324 women in the NHANES 1999-2002. We included participants aged 16-49 years who 
      had valid data on HCMV infection and hypertension. RESULTS: Of the participants, 
      54.7% had serologic evidence of HCMV infection and 17.5% had hypertension. There 
      were ethnic differences in the prevalence of HCMV infection (P<0.001) and 
      hypertension (P<0.001). The prevalence of both increased with age (P<0.001). 
      Before adjustment, HCMV seropositivity was significantly associated with 
      hypertension in women (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.25-2.13, P=0.001) but not in men. After 
      adjustment for race/ethnicity, the association between HCMV seropositivity and 
      hypertension in women remained significant (OR=1.55, 95% CI=1.20-2.02, P=0.002). 
      Further adjustment for body mass index, diabetes status and hypercholesterolemia 
      attenuated the association (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.10-1.90, P=0.010). However, after 
      adjusting for age, the association was no longer significant (OR=1.24, 95% 
      CI=0.91-1.67, P=0.162). CONCLUSIONS: In this nationally representative 
      population-based survey, HCMV seropositivity is associated with hypertension in 
      women in the NHANES population. This association is largely explained by the 
      association of hypertension with age and the increase in past exposure to HCMV 
      with age.
