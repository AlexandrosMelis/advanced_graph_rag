TI  - Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of 
      cervical cancer?
PG  - 647-52
AB  - PURPOSE: Compared with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) may have additional value in the 
      assessment of primary and recurrent cervical cancer. However, the degree of 
      tumour uptake of (18)F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D: -glucose (FDG) uptake is sometimes 
      influenced by diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we conducted this prospective 
      study to compare the diagnostic ability of FDG-PET in patients with cervical 
      cancer complicated by DM and those without DM. METHODS: Patients with untreated 
      locally advanced primary or clinically curable recurrent cervical carcinoma were 
      enrolled. Both FDG-PET and MRI/CT scans were performed within 2 weeks. Patients 
      were categorised into the following groups: hyperglycaemic DM (fasting blood 
      sugar >126 mg/dl), euglycaemic DM and non-DM. The lesions were confirmed 
      histologically or by clinical follow-up. The receiver operating characteristic 
      curve method, with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC), was used to 
      evaluate the discriminative power. RESULTS: From February 2001 to January 2003, 
      219 patients (75 with primary and 144 with recurrent cervical cancer) were 
      eligible for analysis. Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 
      191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic 
      DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to 
      the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) 
      or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). Considering 
      all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT 
      scans in respect of metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012). CONCLUSION: 
      In comparison with its accuracy in non-DM patients, the accuracy of PET in 
      cervical cancer patients with mild to moderate DM was not significantly reduced.
