TI  - Do teleoncology models of care enable safe delivery of chemotherapy in rural 
      towns?
PG  - 406-6.e6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the dose intensity and toxicity profiles for patients 
      undergoing chemotherapy at the Townsville Cancer Centre (TCC), a tertiary cancer 
      centre in northern Queensland, with those for patients treated in Mount Isa, 
      supervised by the same medical oncologists via teleoncology. DESIGN: A 
      quasi-experimental design comparing two patient groups. SETTING: TCC and Mount 
      Isa Hospital, which both operate under the auspices of the Townsville 
      Teleoncology Network (TTN). PARTICIPANTS: Eligible patients who received 
      chemotherapy at TCC or Mt Isa Hospital between 1 May 2007 and 30 April 2012. 
      INTERVENTION: Teleoncology model for managing cancer patients in rural towns. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dose intensity (doses, number of cycles and lines of 
      treatment) and toxicity rates (rate of serious side effects, hospital admissions 
      and mortality). RESULTS: Over 5 years, 89 patients received a total of 626 cycles 
      of various chemotherapy regimens in Mount Isa. During the same period, 117 
      patients who received a total of 799 cycles of chemotherapy at TCC were eligible 
      for inclusion in the comparison group. There were no significant differences 
      between the Mount Isa and TCC patients in most demographic characteristics, mean 
      numbers of treatment cycles, dose intensities, proportions of side effects, and 
      hospital admissions. There were no toxicity-related deaths in either group. 
      CONCLUSION: It appears safe to administer chemotherapy in rural towns under the 
      supervision of medical oncologists from larger centres via teleoncology, provided 
      that rural health care resources and governance arrangements are adequate.
