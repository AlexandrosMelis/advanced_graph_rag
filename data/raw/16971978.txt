TI  - Are complex coronary lesions more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus?
PG  - 935-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary atherosclerotic burden is excessive in diabetic patients. 
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent predictor for both death and myocardial 
      infarction. It is not known whether the prevalence of complex coronary lesions, 
      such as bifurcation and ostial lesions, is different in diabetics from 
      nondiabetics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of present study was to investigate the 
      prevalence of these lesions in patients with DM. METHODS: One thousand fourteen 
      consecutive patients (mean age 61.3+/-10.7 years) were investigated. Coronary 
      angiograms were examined for bifurcation and ostial lesions using a digital 
      quantitative system. Patients were classified as diabetic (n=281) or nondiabetic 
      (n=733). RESULTS: Patient mean age, and rates of hypertension and hyperlipidemia 
      were significantly higher in the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group 
      (P<0.0001), although smoking was significantly lower (P=0.001). Reasons for 
      coronary angiography and treatment were comparable between the two groups. The 
      prevalence of bifurcation lesions and ostial lesions was significantly greater in 
      the diabetic group than in the nondiabetic group (9.8% versus 4.3% [P=0.001] and 
      38.4% versus 29.2% [P=0.003] in the diabetic group versus the nondiabetic group). 
      The presence of DM and greater age were found to be independent predictors for 
      bifurcation lesions (OR=2.27 [P=0.004] and OR=1.03 [P=0.01], for DM and age, 
      respectively) and ostial lesions (OR=1.40 [P=0.027] and OR=1.02 [P=0.001], for DM 
      and age, respectively) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Complex coronary 
      lesions such as bifurcation and ostial lesions were significantly more common in 
      diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. Greater age and the presence of 
      DM were independent predictors for these complex lesions. These results may help 
      to explain the poor prognosis of coronary artery disease among diabetic patients.
