      vascular abnormalities in young obese males?

AB  - PURPOSE: To provide insight into the factors by which obesity in itself may 
      directly lead to early arterial damage, we aimed to determine early sonographic 
      markers of obesity-related vascular dysfunction in young obese males. METHODS: 
      Thirty-five young obese males and 23 age-matched healthy male volunteers were 
      recruited into the study. Common carotid artery pulsatility index and resistance 
      index were calculated from blood flow velocities curves obtained by pulsed 
      Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: The mean pulsatility index, resistance index, 
      body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
      homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, plasma fasting glucose, 
      insulin, C-peptide, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 
      high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were statistically higher in obese subjects 
      than in healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that depressed vessel 
      compliance and increased vascular resistance are features of young, obese, 
      normotensive subjects independently of and in addition to cardiovascular risk 
      factors. As changes in arterial wall properties may be incipient in young obese 
      subjects, future studies will be required to demonstrate whether early 
      intervention such as diet and exercise in this population can improve vascular 
      functions.
