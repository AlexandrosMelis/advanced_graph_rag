TI  - Can students' scores on preclerkship clinical performance examinations predict 
      that they will fail a senior clinical performance examination?

AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to determine whether preclerkship performance 
      examinations could accurately identify medical students at risk for failing a 
      senior clinical performance examination (CPE). METHOD: This study used a 
      retrospective case-control, multiyear design, with contingency table analyses, to 
      examine the performance of 412 students in the classes of 2005 to 2010 at a 
      midwestern medical school. During their second year, these students took four 
      CPEs that each used three standardized patient (SP) cases, for a total of 12 
      cases. The authors correlated each student's average year 2 case score with the 
      student's average case score on a senior (year 4) CPE. Contingency table analysis 
      was carried out using performance on the year 2 CPEs and passing/failing the 
      senior CPE. Similar analyses using each student's United States Medical Licensing 
      Examination (USMLE) Step 1 scores were also performed. Sensitivity, specificity, 
      odds ratio, and relative risk were calculated for two year 2 performance 
      standards. RESULTS: Students' low performances relative to their class on the 
      year 2 CPEs were a strong predictor that they would fail the senior CPE. Their 
      USMLE Step 1 scores also correlated with their performance on the senior CPE, 
      although the predictive values for these scores were considerably weaker. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, preclerkship (year 2) CPEs 
      strongly predicted medical students at risk for failing a senior CPE. This 
      finding opens the opportunity for remediation of deficits prior to or during 
      clerkships.
