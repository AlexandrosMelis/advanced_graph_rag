      Residency?

AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 1000 candidates applied for orthopaedic residency positions 
      in 2014, and the competition is intense; approximately one-third of the 
      candidates failed to secure a position in the match. However, the criteria used 
      in the selection process often are subjective and studies have differed in terms 
      of which criteria predict either objective measures or subjective ratings of 
      resident performance by faculty. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Do preresidency selection 
      factors serve as predictors of success in residency? Specifically, we asked which 
      preresidency selection factors are associated or correlated with (1) objective 
      measures of resident knowledge and performance; and (2) subjective ratings by 
      faculty. METHODS: Charts of 60 orthopaedic residents from our institution were 
      reviewed. Preresidency selection criteria examined included United States Medical 
      Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission 
      Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of 
      recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical 
      society membership, fourth-year subinternship at our institution, and number of 
      publications. Resident performance was assessed using objective measures 
      including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and 
      Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores and subjective ratings by faculty 
      including global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents. We tested 
      associations between preresidency criteria and the subsequent objective and 
      subjective metrics using linear correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney tests when 
      appropriate. RESULTS: Objective measures of resident performance namely, ABOS 
      Part I scores, had a moderate linear correlation with the USMLE Step 2 scores (r 
      = 0.55, p < 0.001) and number of clinical honors received in medical school (r = 
      0.45, p < 0.001). OITE scores had a weak linear correlation with the number of 
      clinical honors (r = 0.35, p = 0.009) and USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.29, p = 
      0.02). With regards to subjective outcomes, AOA membership was associated with 
      higher scores on the global evaluation (p = 0.005). AOA membership also 
      correlated with higher global evaluation scores (r = 0.60, p = 0.005) with the 
      strongest correlation existing between AOA membership and the "interpersonal and 
      communication skills" subsection of the global evaluations. CONCLUSIONS: We found 
      that USMLE Step 2, number of honors in medical school clerkships, and AOA 
      membership demonstrated the strongest correlations with resident performance. Our 
      goal in analyzing these data was to provide residency programs at large a sense 
      of which criteria may be "high yield" in ranking applicants by analyzing data 
      from within our own pool of residents. Similar studies across a broader scope of 
      programs are warranted to confirm applicability of our findings. The continually 
      emerging complexities of the field of orthopaedic surgery lend increasing 
      importance to future work on the appropriate selection and training of 
      orthopaedic residents.
