TI  - Women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary: do they have 
      Lynch syndrome?
PG  - 9344-50
AB  - PURPOSE: Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer; HNPCC) is an 
      autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition syndrome that increases risk for 
      multiple cancers, including colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancer. Revised 
      Bethesda Criteria recommend that patients with two HNPCC-associated cancers 
      undergo molecular evaluation to determine whether they have a mismatch repair 
      (MMR) defect associated with HNPCC. The purpose of our study was to determine the 
      likelihood of MMR defects (MSH2, MSH6, MLH1) in women with synchronous 
      endometrial and ovarian cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1989 and 2004, 102 
      women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers were identified; 59 
      patients had tumor blocks available for analysis. Patients were divided into risk 
      groups based on family history: high (met Amsterdam criteria), medium (personal 
      history or first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer), and low (all 
      others). Protein expression for MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1 was evaluated by 
      immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite instability and MLH1 promoter methylation 
      analyses were performed on a subset of cases. RESULTS: Median age was 50 years. 
      Two patients met Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC. Five additional patients, all 
      medium-risk, had molecular findings consistent with a germline mutation of either 
      MSH2 or MLH1. None of the low-risk patients had molecular results consistent with 
      a germline mutation. CONCLUSION: Overall, 7% of women in our cohort met either 
      clinical or molecular criteria for Lynch syndrome. All of these women had a prior 
      history or a first-degree relative with an HNPCC-associated cancer. Limiting 
      genetic evaluation to women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer who 
      have a family history suggestive of HNPCC may appropriately identify women with 
      Lynch syndrome.
