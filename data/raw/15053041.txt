TI  - Do acute changes in heart rate by isoproterenol affect aortic stiffness in 
      patients with hypertension?
PG  - 33-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased aortic stiffness is a independent risk factor of 
      cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension. Acute changes of the heart 
      rate (HR) have been reported not to affect the aortic stiffness in pacing. 
      However, it is unknown whether acute changes in HR caused by sympathomimetics can 
      affect the aortic stiffness in patients with hypertension. We investigated the 
      effect of acute changes in HR produced by isoproterenol on the aortic stiffness 
      in 17 hypertensive patientss (mean age: 59 +/- 9 years). METHODS: All vasoactive 
      drugs were discontinued at least 3 days before the study. The carotid-to-femoral 
      pulse wave velocity (PWV) was measured by the foot-to-foot method. The pulse 
      waves were recorded at the baseline and at every increase of HR by 5 to 10 bpm 
      with a gradual increase of the dose of isoproterenol. The blood pressures and HR 
      were measured simultaneously. For the analysis, HR, PWV, compliance (C), and 
      compliance index (Ci) were converted as percent changes (delta) from the baseline 
      values. Percent changes of the parameters of the aortic stiffness, i.e., 
      deltaPWV, deltaC, and deltaCi, were grouped by every 10% increase in deltaHR. 
      RESULTS: There was no significant difference among groups in deltaPWV, deltaC and 
      deltaCi (p > 0.05 for each of the group). The regression analysis showed no 
      significant correlation of deltaHR with deltaPWV and deltaC (r = 0.18, 0.13 
      respectively, p > 0.05 for each). deltaCi had a poor correlation with deltaHR (r 
      = 0.22, p < 0.05). However, only 4.6% of deltaCi could be referred to deltaHR (r2 
      = 0.046). CONCLUSION: Aortic stiffness was not affected by acute changes in HR 
      produced by isoproterenol which suggests that it is not necessary to consider 
      acute changes in HR when measuring aortic PWV.
