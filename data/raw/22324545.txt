      response to hormone therapy?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and oestrogen 
      receptor 2 (ESR2) genes are associated with intermediate or endpoint markers of 
      cardiovascular disease and with the efficacy of postmenopausal hormone therapy 
      (HT). Contradictory findings have been described in the past and the role of 
      these genetics variants remains unclear. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      carried out with 266 postmenopausal women, of whom 115 received oral HT (HT+) and 
      151 did not receive any HT (HT-). We analysed three single-nucleotide 
      polymorphisms (SNPs) in ESR1 (rs1801132, rs7757956 and rs2813544) and two in ESR2 
      (rs3020450 and rs7154455) and derived haplotypes with three additional 
      polymorphisms that had been previously investigated by our group (ESR1 rs2234693 
      and ESR2 rs1256049 and rs4986938). RESULTS: The ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism was 
      associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in HT+ postmenopausal 
      women (p = 0.044; pC = 0.388), while one ESR2 gene haplotype was associated with 
      total cholesterol (T-chol) (p = 0.015; pC = 0.090) and LDL-C in HT+ 
      postmenopausal women (p = 0.021; pC = 0.126). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest 
      that, in HT+ postmenopausal women, the rs2813544 polymorphism may influence LDL-C 
      levels and, as previously described, ESR2 rs1256049 is associated with T-chol and 
      LDL-C. No previous study has investigated the association of this SNP set with 
      lipoprotein levels in women while taking into account the hormonal status of the 
      patients.
