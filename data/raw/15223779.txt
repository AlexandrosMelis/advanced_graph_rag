TI  - c-Kit-dependent growth of uveal melanoma cells: a potential therapeutic target?
PG  - 2075-82
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was conducted to investigate the expression and functional 
      impact of the proto-oncogene c-kit in uveal melanoma. METHODS: Based on 
      immunohistochemical (IHC) study of paraffin-embedded specimens from 134 uveal 
      melanomas and Western blot analysis on eight fresh-frozen samples the expression 
      of c-kit in uveal melanoma was studied. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of c-kit 
      and the impact of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 was examined in the three 
      uveal melanoma cell lines OCM-1, OCM-3, and 92-1. RESULTS: Eighty-four of 134 
      paraffin-embedded samples and six of eight fresh-frozen samples expressed c-kit. 
      c-Kit was strongly expressed and tyrosine phosphorylated in cultured uveal 
      melanoma cells compared with cutaneous melanoma cells. Moreover, in contrast to 
      cutaneous melanoma cell lines c-kit maintained a high phosphorylation level in 
      serum-depleted uveal melanoma cells. No activation-related mutations in exon 11 
      of the KIT gene were found. On the contrary, expression of the stem cell growth 
      factor (c-kit ligand) was detected in all three uveal melanoma cell lines, 
      suggesting the presence of autocrine (paracrine) stimulation pathways. Treatment 
      of uveal melanoma cell lines with STI571, which blocks c-kit autophosphorylation, 
      resulted in cell death. The IC(50) of the inhibitory effects on c-kit 
      phosphorylation and cell proliferation was of equal size and less than 2.5 
      microM. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that c-kit is vastly expressed in uveal 
      melanoma, suggest that the c-kit molecular pathway may be important in uveal 
      melanoma growth, and point to its use as a target for therapy with STI571.
