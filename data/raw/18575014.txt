TI  - Nasal polyposis: is there an inheritance pattern? A single family study.
PG  - 125-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasal Polyposis (NP) is defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of 
      sinonasal mucosa leading to diffuse formation of benign polyps. Although family 
      histories are frequently suggested in medical literature, no specific study 
      focused on this point has been reported. The purpose of this study is to 
      determine whether a hereditary factor could be implied for NP in a family where 
      several members were affected. We included 99 members of this family. METHODS: 
      All patients were assessed for conditions known to be associated with the 
      development or presence of NP. Concerning NP, patients were screened with a 
      validated questionnaire and selected patients had a medical examination by an 
      Ear, Nose and Throat practitioner. RESULTS: Thirteen patients had a personal 
      history of NP without asthma, aspirin intolerance, Churg Strauss syndrome, cystic 
      fibrosis, Young's syndrome, bare lymphocyte syndrome, or primary ciliary 
      dyskinesia. Within this family, 19.7% of those older than 17 years were affected 
      by NP, as compared with the national French prevalence of 2.1%. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Regarding the pedigree, we discuss different modes of inheritance. The presence 
      of consanguineous unions in this family suggests the possibility of a common 
      ancestor and thus a recessive autosomal mode of inheritance.
