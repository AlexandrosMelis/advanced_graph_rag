AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury remains a major cause of early 
      morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation with poorly documented 
      extrapulmonary repercussions. To determine the hemodynamic effect due to lung IR 
      injury, we performed a quantitative coronary blood-flow analysis in a swine model 
      of in situ lung ischemia and reperfusion. METHODS: In 14 healthy pigs, blood flow 
      was measured in the ascending aorta, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex 
      (Cx), right coronary artery (RCA), right common carotid artery (RCCA), and left 
      internal mammary artery (LIMA), along with left-and right-ventricular pressures 
      (LVP and RVP), aortic pressure (AoP), and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). 
      Cardiac Troponin (cTn), interleukin 6 and 10 (IL-6 and IL-10), and tumor necrosis 
      factor A (TNF-A) were measured in coronary sinus blood samples. The experimental 
      (IR) group (n=10) underwent 60 min of lung ischemia followed by 60 min of 
      reperfusion by clamping and releasing the left pulmonary hilum. Simultaneous 
      measurements of all parameters were made at baseline and during IR. The control 
      group (n=4) had similar measurements without lung IR. RESULTS: In the IR group, 
      total coronary flow (TCF=LAD+Cx+RCA blood-flow) decreased precipitously and 
      significantly from baseline (113+/-41 ml min"1) during IR (p<0.05), with the lowest 
      value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). Baseline cTn 
      (0.08+/-0.02 ng ml(-1)) increased during IR and peaked at 45 min of reperfusion 
      (+138%, p<0.001). Baseline IL-6 (9.2+/-2.17 pg ml(-1)) increased during IR and 
      peaked at 60 min of reperfusion (+228%, p<0.0001). Significant LVP drop at 5 min 
      of ischemia (p<0.05) was followed by a slow return to baseline at 45 min of 
      ischemia. A second LVP drop occurred at reperfusion (p<0.05) and persisted. 
      Conversely, RVP increased throughout ischemia (p<0.05) and returned toward 
      baseline during reperfusion. Coronary blood flow and hemodynamic profile remained 
      unchanged in the control group. IL-10 and TNF-A remained below the measurable 
      range for both the groups. CONCLUSIONS: In situ lung IR has a marked negative 
      impact on coronary blood flow, hemodynamics, and inflammatory profile. In 
      addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where coronary 
      blood flow is directly measured during lung IR, revealing the associated 
      increased cardiac risk.
