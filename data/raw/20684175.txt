TI  - Vitamin D supplementation and regulatory T cells in apparently healthy subjects: 
      vitamin D treatment for autoimmune diseases?
PG  - 136-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data show significant associations of vitamin D 
      deficiency and autoimmune diseases. Vitamin D may prevent autoimmunity by 
      stimulating naturally occurring regulatory T cells. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate 
      whether vitamin D supplementation increases Tregs frequency (%Tregs) within 
      circulating CD4+ T cells. METHODS: We performed an uncontrolled vitamin D 
      supplementation trial among 50 apparently healthy subjects including 
      supplementation of 140,000 IU at baseline and after 4 weeks (visit 1). The final 
      follow-up visit was performed 8 weeks after the baseline examination (visit 2). 
      Blood was drawn at each study visit to determine 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and 
      %Tregs. Tregs were characterized as CD4+CD25++ T cells with expression of the 
      transcription factor forkhead box P3 and low or absent expression of CD127. 
      RESULTS: Forty-six study participants (65% females, mean age +/- SD 31 +/- 8 
      years) completed the trial. 25(OH)D levels increased from 23.9 +/- 12.9 ng/ml at 
      baseline to 45.9 +/- 14.0 ng/ml at visit 1 and 58.0 +/- 15.1 ng/ml at visit 2. 
      %Tregs at baseline were 4.8 +/- 1.4. Compared to baseline levels we noticed a 
      significant increase of %Tregs at study visit 1 (5.9 +/- 1.7, P < 0.001) and 2 
      (5.6 +/- 1.6, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation was associated 
      with significantly increased %Tregs in apparently healthy individuals. This 
      immunomodulatory effect of vitamin D might underlie the associations of vitamin D 
      deficiency and autoimmune diseases. Hence, our finding provides a rationale for 
      further studies to investigate vitamin D effects on autoimmunological processes.
