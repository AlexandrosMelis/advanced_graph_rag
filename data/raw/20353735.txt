TI  - Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients with ergocalciferol: are 
      current K/DOQI treatment guidelines adequate?
PG  - 276-85
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency (VDDI) is common in CKD patients 
      and may be associated with abnormal mineral metabolism. It is not clear whether 
      the K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol are adequate for correction of 
      VDDI and hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: Retrospective study of 88 patients with 
      CKD Stages 1 - 5 and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level < 30 ng/ml (< 75 nmol/l). 
      Patients treated with ergocalciferol as recommended by K/DOQI guidelines. Only 53 
      patients had elevated baseline PTH level for the CKD stage. Patients were 
      excluded if they received vitamin D preparations other than ergocalciferol or 
      phosphate binders. 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, intact PTH level (iPTH), and other 
      parameters of mineral metabolism were measured at baseline and after completion 
      of ergocalciferol course. RESULTS: 88 patients with CKD were treated with 
      ergocalciferol. Mean age 56.8 +/- 9.5 years and 41% were males. The mean (+/- SD) 
      GFR was 28.3 +/- 16.6 ml/min. At the end of the 6-month period of ergocalciferol 
      treatment, the mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D level increased from 15.1 +/- 5.8 to 23.3 
      +/- 11.8 ng/ml (37.75 +/- 14.5 to 58.25 +/- 29.5 nmol/l) (p < 0.001). Treatment 
      led to > or = 5 ng/ml (12.5 nmol/l) increases in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level in 54% 
      of treated patients, and only 25% achieved levels > or = 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l). 
      Mean iPTH level decreased from 157.9 +/- 125.9 to 150.7 +/- 127.5 pg/ml (p = 
      0.5). Only 26% of patients had > or = 30% decrease in their iPTH level after 
      treatment with ergocalciferol. CONCLUSIONS: Current K/DOQI guidelines are 
      inadequate for correcting VDDI or secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. 
      Future studies should examine the effects of higher or more frequent dosing of 
      ergocalciferol on these clinical endpoints.
