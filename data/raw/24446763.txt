AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test if secular growth acceleration occurs during fetal life. 
      METHODS: ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-test have been used for the 
      biometric characteristics comparison of nowadays fetal population with those 
      three decades ago and to test the hypothesis about the existence of secular 
      growth acceleration during fetal life. For this purpose, we first calculated mean 
      values of particular biometric parameters for the whole pregnancy. During the 
      period 2002-2009 biparietal diameter, fetal length and abdominal circumference 
      measurements in singleton uncomplicated pregnancies between 22 and 41 gestational 
      weeks were obtained. Gestational age was estimated according to Naegele's rule 
      and confirmed with an early ultrasound examination. Pregnancies with fetal 
      cromosomopathies and malformations were excluded as well as those resulting in 
      perinatal death. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences of 
      the examined fetal biometric parameters measured by ultrasound between 
      contemporary fetal population and those from 35 years ago. CONCLUSION: Our 
      investigation did not undoubtedly prove that significant changes of fetal 
      biometric parameters occurred in the last three decades. It is possible that 
      secular growth acceleration does not exist in prenatal period but also the 
      observed time period could have been short for this phenomenon to manifest.
