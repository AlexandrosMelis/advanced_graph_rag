TI  - Is hypoalbuminemia an independent prognostic factor in patients with gastric 
      cancer?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have indicated that hypoalbuminemia is associated with 
      decreased survival of patients with gastric cancer. However, the prognostic value 
      of albumin may be secondary to an ongoing systemic inflammatory response. The aim 
      of the study was to assess the relation between hypoalbuminemia, the systemic 
      inflammatory response, and survival in patients with gastric cancer. METHODS: 
      Patients diagnosed with gastric carcinoma attending the upper gastrointestinal 
      surgical unit in the Royal Infirmary, Glasgow between April 1997 and December 
      2005 and who had a pretreatment measurement of albumin and C-reactive protein 
      (CRP) were studied. RESULTS: Most of the patients had stage III/IV disease and 
      received palliative treatment. The minimum follow-up was 15 months. During 
      follow-up, 157 (72%) patients died of their cancer. On univariate analysis, stage 
      (p < 0.001), treatment (p < 0.001), albumin level (p < 0.001), and CRP level (p < 
      0.001) were significant predictors of survival. On multivariate analysis, stage 
      (p < 0.001), treatment (p < 0.001), and CRP level (p < 0.001) remained 
      significant predictors of survival. Albumin was no longer an independent 
      predictor of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Low albumin concentrations are associated 
      with poorer survival in patients with gastric cancer. However, the strength of 
      this relation with survival is dependent on the presence of a systemic 
      inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated CRP level. Therefore, it 
      appears that the relation between hypoalbuminemia and poor survival is secondary 
      to that of the systemic inflammatory response.
