AB  - BACKGROUND: Broad-based electronic health information exchange (HIE), in which 
      patients' clinical data follow them between care delivery settings, is expected 
      to produce large quality gains and cost savings. Although these benefits are 
      assumed to result from reducing redundant care, there is limited supporting 
      empirical evidence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether HIE adoption is associated 
      with decreases in repeat imaging in emergency departments (EDs). DATA 
      SOURCE/STUDY SETTING: ED discharge data from the State Emergency Department 
      Databases for California and Florida for 2007-2010 were merged with Health 
      Information Management Systems Society data that report hospital HIE 
      participation. METHODS: Using regression with ED fixed effects and trends, we 
      performed a retrospective analysis of the impact of HIE participation on repeat 
      imaging, comparing 37 EDs that initiated HIE participation during the study 
      period to 410 EDs that did not participate in HIE during the same period. Within 
      3 common types of imaging tests [computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and chest 
      x-ray), we defined a repeat image for a given patient as the same study in the 
      same body region performed within 30 days at unaffiliated EDs. RESULTS: In our 
      sample there were 20,139 repeat CTs (representing 14.7% of those cases with CT in 
      the index visit), 13,060 repeat ultrasounds (20.7% of ultrasound cases), and 
      29,703 repeat chest x-rays (19.5% of x-ray cases). HIE was associated with 
      reduced probability of repeat ED imaging in all 3 modalities: -8.7 percentage 
      points for CT [95% confidence interval (CI): -14.7, -2.7], -9.1 percentage points 
      for ultrasound (95% CI: -17.2, -1.1), and -13.0 percentage points for chest x-ray 
      (95% CI: -18.3, -7.7), reflecting reductions of 44%-67% relative to sample means. 
      CONCLUSIONS: HIE was associated with reduced repeat imaging in EDs. This study is 
      among the first to find empirical support for this anticipated benefit of HIE.
