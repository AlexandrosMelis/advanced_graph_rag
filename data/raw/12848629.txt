TI  - Is a 9-month treatment sufficient in tuberculous enterocolitis? A prospective, 
      randomized, single-centre study.
PG  - 85-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis has increased in parallel with the acquired 
      immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic and the use of immunosuppressive therapy, and 
      the growing incidence of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, especially with intestinal 
      involvement, reflects this trend. However, the duration of anti-tuberculous 
      therapy has not been clarified in intestinal tuberculosis. AIM: To compare the 
      efficacy of different treatment durations in tuberculous enterocolitis in terms 
      of response and recurrence rates. METHODS: Forty patients with tuberculous 
      enterocolitis were randomized prospectively: 22 patients into a 9-month and 18 
      into a 15-month group. Diagnosis was made either by colonoscopic findings of 
      discrete ulcers and histopathological findings of caseating granuloma and/or 
      acid-fast bacilli, or by clinical improvement after therapeutic trial. Patients 
      were followed up with colonoscopy every other month until complete response or 
      treatment completion, and then every 6 months for 1 year and annually. Complete 
      response was defined as a resolution of symptoms and active tuberculosis by 
      colonoscopy. RESULTS: Complete response was obtained in all patients in both 
      groups. Two patients in the 9-month group and one in the 15-month group underwent 
      operation due to intestinal obstruction and perianal fistula, respectively. No 
      recurrence of active intestinal tuberculosis occurred during the follow-up period 
      in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculous enterocolitis can be managed by 9-month 
      chemotherapy without disease recurrence. Further investigations are needed in 
      immunocompromised patients.
