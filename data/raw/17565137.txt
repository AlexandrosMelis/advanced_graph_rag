TI  - Out of the smokescreen II: will an advertisement targeting the tobacco industry 
      affect young people's perception of smoking in movies and their intention to 
      smoke?
PG  - 177-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of an antismoking advertisement on young 
      people's perceptions of smoking in movies and their intention to smoke. 
      SUBJECTS/SETTING: 3091 cinema patrons aged 12-24 years in three Australian 
      states; 18.6% of the sample (n = 575) were current smokers. DESIGN/INTERVENTION: 
      Quasi-experimental study of patrons, surveyed after having viewed a movie. The 
      control group was surveyed in week 1, and the intervention group in weeks 2 and 
      3. Before seeing the movie in weeks 2 and 3, a 30 s antismoking advertisement was 
      shown, shot in the style of a movie trailer that warned patrons not to be sucked 
      in by the smoking in the movie they were about to see. OUTCOMES: Attitude of 
      current smokers and non-smokers to smoking in the movies; intention of current 
      smokers and non-smokers to smoke in 12 months. RESULTS: Among non-smokers, 47.8% 
      of the intervention subjects thought that the smoking in the viewed movie was not 
      OK compared with 43.8% of the control subjects (p = 0.04). However, there was no 
      significant difference among smokers in the intervention (16.5%) and control 
      (14.5%) groups (p = 0.4). A higher percentage of smokers in the intervention 
      group indicated that they were likely to be smoking in 12 months time (38.6%) 
      than smokers in the control group (25.6%; p<0.001). For non-smokers, there was no 
      significant difference in smoking intentions between groups, with 1.2% of 
      intervention subjects and 1.6% of controls saying that they would probably be 
      smoking in 12 months time (p = 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study suggests 
      that placing an antismoking advertisement before movies containing smoking scenes 
      can help to immunise non-smokers against the influences of film stars' smoking. 
      Caution must be exercised in the type of advertisement screened as some types of 
      advertising may reinforce smokers' intentions to smoke.
