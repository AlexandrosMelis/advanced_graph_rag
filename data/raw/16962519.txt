TI  - Volume change of uterine myomas during pregnancy: do myomas really grow?
PG  - 386-90
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in uterine myoma volume during pregnancy. 
      DESIGN: Review of departmental electronic perinatal database and medical records. 
      Canadian Task Force Classification II-3. SETTING: Obstetrical ultrasound unit in 
      an academic tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred-seven patients diagnosed 
      with uterine myomas during pregnancy and who had two or more obstetrical 
      ultrasounds in different periods of pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS: We analyzed the 
      change in volume of uterine myomas between the first half of pregnancy (up until 
      19 weeks), third quarter (20-30 weeks), and last quarter (31 weeks to term). The 
      volume of largest uterine myoma was calculated using the formula Volume 
      (mm3)=Pi/6x(length mm)x(width mm)x(height mm). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The 
      mean age of the population was 31+/-6 years. Between the first and the second 
      study periods, the percentage of uterine myomas that decreased in size was 55.1% 
      (95% CI: 43-66), with a mean decrease in volume of 35%+/-4%; while the percentage 
      of uterine myomas that enlarged was 44.9% (95% CI: 34-56), with a mean increase 
      in volume of 69%+/-11%. Between the second and the third study periods, 75% (95% 
      CI: 56-87) became smaller, with a mean decrease in volume of 30%+/-3%; while 25% 
      (95% CI: 13-43) enlarged, with a mean increase in volume of 102%+/-62%. 
      CONCLUSION: Contrary to common belief, we found that uterine myomas commonly 
      decrease in volume over the course of pregnancy.
