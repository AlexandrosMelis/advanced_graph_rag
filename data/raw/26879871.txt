TI  - Does depression diagnosis and antidepressant prescribing vary by location? 
      Analysis of ethnic density associations using a large primary-care dataset.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have linked ethnic differences in depression rates with 
      neighbourhood ethnic density although results have not been conclusive. We looked 
      at this using a novel approach analysing whole population data covering just over 
      one million GP patients in four London boroughs. METHOD: Using a dataset of GP 
      records for all patients registered in Lambeth, Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Newham 
      in 2013 we investigated new diagnoses of depression and antidepressant use for: 
      Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, black Caribbean and black African patients. 
      Neighbourhood effects were assessed independently of GP practice using a 
      cross-classified multilevel model. RESULTS: Black and minority ethnic groups are 
      up to four times less likely to be newly diagnosed with depression or prescribed 
      antidepressants compared to white British patients. We found an inverse 
      relationship between neighbourhood ethnic density and new depression diagnosis 
      for some groups, where an increase of 10% own-ethnic density was associated with 
      a statistically significant (p < 0.05) reduced odds of depression for Pakistani 
      [odds ratio (OR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-0.93], Indian (OR 0.88, 
      CI 0.81-0.95), African (OR 0.88, CI 0.78-0.99) and Bangladeshi (OR 0.94, CI 
      0.90-0.99) patients. Black Caribbean patients, however, showed the opposite 
      effect (OR 1.26, CI 1.09-1.46). The results for antidepressant use were very 
      similar although the corresponding effect for black Caribbeans was no longer 
      statistically significant (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: New depression diagnosis and 
      antidepressant use was shown to be less likely in areas of higher own-ethnic 
      density for some, but not all, ethnic groups.
