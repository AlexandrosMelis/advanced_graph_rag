AB  - OBJECTIVES: Acupuncture has been successfully used in myofascial pain syndromes. 
      However, the number of needles used, that is, the dose of acupuncture 
      stimulation, to obtain the best antinociceptive efficacy is still a matter of 
      debate. The question was addressed comparing the clinical efficacy of two 
      different therapeutic schemes, characterized by a different number of needles 
      used on 36 patients between 29-60 years of age with by a painful cervical 
      myofascial syndrome. METHODS: Patients were divided into two groups; the first 
      group of 18 patients were treated with 5 needles and the second group of 18 
      patients were treated with 11 needles, the time of needle stimulation was the 
      same in both groups: 100 seconds. Each group underwent six cycles of somatic 
      acupuncture. Pain intensity was evaluated before, immediately after and 1 and 3 
      months after the treatment by means of both the Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire and 
      the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In both groups, the needles were fixed 
      superficially excluding the two most painful trigger points where they were 
      deeply inserted. RESULTS: Both groups, independently from the number of needles 
      used, obtained a good therapeutic effect without clinically relevant differences. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For this pathology, the number of needles, 5 or 11, seems not to be 
      an important variable in determining the therapeutic effect when the time of 
      stimulation is the same in the two groups.
