AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine age-related differences in the relationship between 
      personality and coping strategies in an Australian population of psychiatric 
      inpatients. METHOD: Consenting eligible adults (N=238) from 18-100 years of age 
      consecutively admitted to inpatient psychiatry units were assessed using the SCID 
      I and II, the Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced Scale (COPE), the Brief 
      Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale 
      (GAF), the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS), the 12 
      Item Short-Form Heath Survey (SF12), the Sarason Social Support Questionnaire, 
      and the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (cognitively impaired, and 
      non-English speaking patients were excluded). RESULTS: Older adults reported less 
      symptomatology than younger patients and younger patients described more 
      personality dysfunction than older patients. As assessed by the COPE, older 
      adults reported lower levels of dysfunctional coping strategies than younger 
      adults. Personality traits, social supports, gender, and age predicted coping 
      strategies, while Axis I diagnosis, education, personality disorder, and symptom 
      severity were not significant predictors of coping strategies. CONCLUSION: This 
      study found that influences on coping were multifactorial and moderated by age. 
      These factors have implications for interventions designed to enhance coping 
      strategies.
