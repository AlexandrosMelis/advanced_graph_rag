TI  - Does tranexamic acid reduce desmopressin-induced hyperfibrinolysis?
PG  - 539-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Desmopressin releases tissue-type plasminogen activator, which 
      augments cardiopulmonary bypass--associated hyperfibrinolysis, causing excessive 
      bleeding. Combined use of desmopressin with prior administration of the 
      antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid may decrease fibrinolytic activity and 
      might improve postoperative hemostasis. METHODS: This prospective randomized 
      study was carried out with 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass 
      operations between April 1999 and November 2000 in Gulhane Military Medical 
      Academy. Patients were divided into 2 groups. Desmopressin (0.3 microg/kg) was 
      administrated just after cardiopulmonary bypass and after protamine infusion in 
      group 1 (n = 50). Both desmopressin and tranexamic acid (before the skin incision 
      at a loading dose of 10 mg/kg over 30 minutes and followed by 12 hours of 1 
      mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) were administrated in group 2 (n = 50). RESULTS: Significantly 
      less drainage was noted in group 2 (1010 +/- 49.9 mL vs 623 +/- 41.3 mL, P 
      =.0001). Packed red blood cells were transfused at 2.1 +/- 0.5 units per patient 
      in group 1 versus 0.9 +/- 0.3 units in group 2 (P =.0001). Fresh frozen plasma 
      was transfused at 1.84 +/- 0.17 units per patient in group 1 versus 0.76 +/- 0.14 
      units in group 2 (P =.0001). Only 24% of patients in group 2 required donor blood 
      or blood products compared with 74% of those in the isolated desmopressin group 
      (group 1, P =.00001). Group 1 and group 2 findings were as follows: postoperative 
      fibrinogen, 113 +/- 56.3 mg/dL versus 167 +/- 45.8 mg/dL (P =.0001); fibrin split 
      product, 21.2 +/- 2.3 ng/mL versus 13.5 +/- 3.4 ng/mL (P =.0001); and 
      postoperative hemoglobin level, 7.6 plus minus 1.2 g/dL versus 9.1 plus minus 1.2 
      g/dL (P =.0001). CONCLUSION: Tranexamic acid administration significantly reduces 
      desmopressin and bypass-induced hyperfibrinolysis. Combined use of tranexamic 
      acid and desmopressin decreases both postoperative blood loss and transfusion 
      requirement.
