TI  - Is there a favorable subset of patients with prostate cancer who develop 
      oligometastases?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze, retrospectively, the patterns and behavior of metastatic 
      lesions in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy and 
      to investigate whether patients with < or =5 lesions had an improved outcome 
      relative to patients with >5 lesions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The treatment and 
      outcome of 369 eligible patients with Stage T1-T3aN0-NXM0 prostate cancer were 
      analyzed during a minimal 10-year follow-up period. All patients were treated 
      with curative intent to a mean dose of 65 Gy. The full history of any metastatic 
      disease was documented for each subject, including the initial site of 
      involvement, any progression over time, and patient survival. RESULTS: The 
      overall survival rate for the 369 patients was 75% at 5 years and 45% at 10 
      years. The overall survival rate of patients who never developed metastases was 
      90% and 81% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. However, among the 74 patients (20%) 
      who developed metastases, the survival rate at both 5 and 10 years was 
      significantly reduced (p <0.0001). The overall survival rate for patients who 
      developed bone metastases was 58% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and 
      patients with bone metastases to the pelvis fared worse compared with those with 
      vertebral metastases. With regard to the metastatic number, patients with < or =5 
      metastatic lesions had superior survival rates relative to those with >5 lesions 
      (73% and 36% at 5 and 10 years vs. 45% and 18% at 5 and 10 years, respectively; p 
      = 0.02). In addition, both the metastasis-free survival rate and the interval 
      measured from the date of the initial diagnosis of prostate cancer to the 
      development of bone metastasis were statistically superior for patients with < or 
      =5 lesions compared with patients with >5 lesions (p = 0.01 and 0.02, 
      respectively). However, the survival rate and the interval from the date of 
      diagnosis of bone metastasis to the time of death for patients in both groups 
      were not significantly different, statistically (p = 0.17 and 0.27, 
      respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with < or =5 metastatic sites had 
      significantly better survival rates than patients with >5 lesions. Because 
      existing sites of metastatic disease may be the primary sites of origin for 
      additional metastases, our findings suggest that early detection and aggressive 
      treatment of patients with a small number of metastatic lesions is worth testing 
      as an approach to improving long-term survival.
