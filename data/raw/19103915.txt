AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is an urgent need to increase opportunistic screening for 
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in community settings, particularly for 
      those who are at increased risk including men who have sex with men (MSM). The 
      aim of this qualitative study was to explore whether home sampling kits (HSK) for 
      multiple bacterial STIs are potentially acceptable among MSM and to identify any 
      concerns regarding their use. This study was developed as part of a formative 
      evaluation of HSKs. METHODS: Focus groups and one-to-one semi-structured 
      interviews with MSM were conducted. Focus group participants (n = 20) were shown 
      a variety of self-sampling materials and asked to discuss them. Individual 
      interviewees (n = 24) had experience of the self-sampling techniques as part of a 
      pilot clinical study. All data were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. 
      Data were analysed using a framework analysis approach. RESULTS: The concept of a 
      HSK was generally viewed as positive, with many benefits identified relating to 
      increased access to testing, enhanced personal comfort and empowerment. Concerns 
      about the accuracy of the test, delays in receiving the results, the possible 
      lack of support and potential negative impact on 'others' were raised. 
      CONCLUSION: The widespread acceptability of using HSKs for the diagnosis of STIs 
      could have important public health impacts in terms of earlier diagnosis of 
      asymptomatic infections and thus a decrease in the rate of onward transmission. 
      In addition, HSKs could potentially optimize the use of genitourinary medicine 
      services and facilitate patient choice.
