AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to explore whether availability of sports 
      facilities, parks, and neighbourhood social capital (NSC) and their interaction 
      are associated with leisure time sports participation among Dutch adolescents. 
      METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses were conducted on complete data from the last 
      wave of the YouRAction evaluation trial. Adolescents (n = 852) completed a 
      questionnaire asking for sports participation, perceived NSC and demographics. 
      Ecometric methods were used to aggregate perceived NSC to zip code level. 
      Availability of sports facilities and parks was assessed by means of geographic 
      information systems within the zip-code area and within a 1600 meter buffer. 
      Multilevel logistic regression analyses, with neighborhood and individual as 
      levels, were conducted to examine associations between physical and social 
      environmental factors and leisure time sports participation. Simple slopes 
      analysis was conducted to decompose interaction effects. RESULTS: NSC was 
      significantly associated with sports participation (OR: 3.51 (95%CI: 1.18;10.41)) 
      after adjustment for potential confounders. Availability of sports facilities and 
      availability of parks were not associated with sports participation. A 
      significant interaction between NSC and density of parks within the neighbourhood 
      area (OR: 1.22 (90%CI: 1.01;1.34)) was found. Decomposition of the interaction 
      term showed that adolescents were most likely to engage in leisure time sports 
      when both availability of parks and NSC were highest. CONCLUSIONS: The results of 
      this study indicate that leisure time sports participation is associated with 
      levels of NSC, but not with availability of parks or sports facilities. In 
      addition, NSC and availability of parks in the zip code area interacted in such a 
      way that leisure time sports participation is most likely among adolescents 
      living in zip code areas with higher levels of NSC, and higher availability of 
      parks. Hence, availability of parks appears only to be important for leisure time 
      sports participation when NSC is high.
