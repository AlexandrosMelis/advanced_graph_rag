TI  - Do clinical variables predict pathologic radiographs in the first episode of 
      wheezing?
PG  - 8-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinical variables assessed in relation to Albuterol 
      aerosol treatments accurately identify children with pathologic radiographs 
      during their initial episode of bronchospasm. METHODS: A prospective convenience 
      sample of children with a first episode of wheezing. Data collected included 
      demographics, baseline and post-treatment clinical score and physical 
      examination, number of aerosols, requirement for supplemental oxygen, and 
      disposition. Chest radiographs were obtained and interpreted, and patients were 
      divided into 2 groups based on a pathologic versus nonpathologic radiograph 
      interpretation. Chi2 testing was performed for categoric variables, and the 
      student t test was performed for continuous variables. A discriminant analysis 
      was used to develop a model. RESULTS: Pathologic radiographs were identified in 
      61 patients (9%). Between groups, a significant difference was noted for 
      pretreatment oxygen saturation only. Clinical score, respiratory rate, and 
      presence of rales both pretreatment and posttreatment were not significantly 
      different between groups. The discriminant analysis correctly predicted 90% of 
      nonpathologic radiographs but only 15% of pathologic radiographs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Clinical variables, either isolated or as components of a model, could not 
      identify all children with pathologic radiographs.
