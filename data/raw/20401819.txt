AB  - PURPOSE: Ultrasound is currently not established for the diagnosis of fractures. 
      The aim of this study was to compare ultrasound and X-ray beyond their use solely 
      for the identification of fractures, i. e., for the detection of fracture type 
      and dislocation for pediatric fracture diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Limb 
      bones of dead young pigs served as a model for pediatric bones. The fractured 
      bones were examined with ultrasound, X-ray, and CT, which served as the gold 
      standard. RESULTS: 162 of 248 bones were fractured. 130 fractures were identified 
      using ultrasound, and 148 using X-ray. There were some advantages of X-ray over 
      ultrasound in the detection of fracture type (80 correct results using X-ray, 66 
      correct results using ultrasound). Ultrasound, however, was superior to X-ray for 
      dislocation identification (41 correct results using X-ray, 51 correct results 
      using ultrasound). Both findings were not statistically significant after 
      adjustment for multiple testing. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound not only has comparable 
      sensitivity to that of X-ray for the identification of limb fractures but is also 
      equally effective for the diagnosis of fracture type and dislocation. Thus, 
      ultrasound can be used as an adequate alternative method to X-ray for pediatric 
      fracture diagnosis.
