AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was performed to evaluate the clinical and technical 
      efficacy of endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) of small saphenous varicosities, 
      particularly in relation to the site of endovenous access. METHODS: Totally 59 
      patients with unilateral saphenopopliteal junction incompetence and small 
      saphenous vein reflux underwent EVLA (810 nm, 14 W diode laser) with ambulatory 
      phlebectomies. Small saphenous vein access was gained at the lowest site of 
      truncal reflux. Patients were divided into 2 groups: access gained above mid-calf 
      (AMC, n = 33) and below mid-calf (BMC, n = 26) levels. Outcomes included Venous 
      Clinical Severity Scores (VCSS), Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), 
      patient satisfaction, complications, and recurrence rates. RESULTS: Both groups 
      demonstrated significant improvement in VCSS, AVVQ, generic quality of life Short 
      Form 36, and EuroQol scores (P < .05) up to 1 year. No differences were seen 
      between AMC and BMC groups for complications (phlebitis: 2 [6%] and 1 [3.8%], P > 
      .05; paresthesia: 2 [6%] and 5 [19%], P = .223) and recurrence (3 [9%] and 1 
      [3.8%], P = .623), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The site of access in our study 
      does not appear to influence complications specifically neural injury or 
      recurrence rates.
