AB  - PURPOSE: Cardiovascular disease is prevalent among workers with high levels of 
      occupational physical activity. The increased risk may be due to a high relative 
      aerobic workload, possibly leading to increased blood pressure. However, studies 
      investigating the relation between relative aerobic workload and ambulatory blood 
      pressure (ABP) are lacking. The aim was to explore the relationship between 
      objectively measured relative aerobic workload and ABP. METHODS: A total of 116 
      cleaners aged 18-65 years were included after informed consent was obtained. A 
      portable device (Spacelabs 90217) was mounted for 24-h measurements of ABP, and 
      an Actiheart was mounted for 24-h heart rate measurements to calculate relative 
      aerobic workload as percentage of relative heart rate reserve. A repeated-measure 
      multi-adjusted mixed model was applied for analysis. RESULTS: A fully adjusted 
      mixed model of measurements throughout the day showed significant positive 
      relations (p < 0.001): a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload was 
      associated with an increase of 0.42 +/- 0.05 mmHg (95% CI 0.32-0.52 mmHg) in 
      systolic ABP and 0.30 +/- 0.04 mmHg (95% CI 0.22-0.38 mmHg) in diastolic ABP. 
      Correlations between relative aerobic workload and ABP were significant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Because workers may have an elevated relative aerobic workload for 
      several hours each working day, this relationship may elucidate a mechanism 
      behind the increased risk for cardiovascular disease among workers exposed to 
      high levels of occupational physical activity.
