TI  - Is low serum chloride level a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality?
PG  - 177-84
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum chloride level is routinely assayed in clinical laboratories in 
      the management of patients with kidney disorders and with metabolic diseases. It 
      is a biological parameter that is easily, precisely and relatively cheaply 
      measured. The epidemiological features of serum chloride levels have not been 
      studied before. METHODS: For the random sample of men and women from the Belgian 
      Interuniversity Research on Nutrition and Health aged 25-74 years, free of 
      symptomatic coronary heart disease at baseline, serum chloride concentrations 
      were measured, among those of other electrolytes. The cohort was followed up for 
      10 years with respect to subsequent cause-specific mortality. RESULTS: The 
      results are based on observations of 4793 men and 4313 women. According to Cox 
      regression analysis serum chloride level was one of the strongest predictors of 
      total, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD mortalities independently of age, 
      body mass index, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, levels of total and 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, uric acid, serum creatinine and serum total 
      proteins and intake of diuretics. This relation was proved to be independent of 
      levels of other serum electrolytes and similar for men and women. The estimated 
      adjusted risk ratio for CVD death for subjects with a serum chloride level < or 
      =100 mmol/l compared with those with levels above that limit was 1.65 (95% 
      confidence interval 1.06-2.57) for men and 2.16 (95% confidence interval 
      1.11-4.22) for women. The study of adjusted risk ratios for four groups of 
      subjects defined on the basis of their baseline serum chloride levels revealed a 
      decreasing log-linear 'dose-response' relation to total and cardiovascular 
      mortalities. CONCLUSION: This s the first report from a population-based study to 
      indicate that there is an association between serum chloride level and the 
      incidence of total, CVD and non-CVD mortalities. The risk ratio for CVD mortality 
      associated with a low serum chloride level was comparable to or higher than those 
      observed for well-established CVD risk factors.
