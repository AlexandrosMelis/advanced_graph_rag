TI  - Does Paget's disease exist in India?: A series of 21 patients.
PG  - 530-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Paget's disease of bone has been described as a few case reports from 
      India. The aim of the present study is to document the existence of Paget's 
      disease (PD) in India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We describe demography, clinical 
      manifestations, biochemical and radiological profile and the treatment outcome of 
      21 patients of PD. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of these patients at presentation 
      was 49.2 +/- 17.6 years and the male to female ratio was 2.5:1. Common clinical 
      manifestations included backache, headache and bone pains. Others were fracture, 
      joint pain, deafness, gait ataxia, visual impairment and difficulty in biting. 
      Two patients presented with hydrocephalus and one had recurrent paraparesis. 
      Fifteen (71.4%) patients had polyostotic and six (28.6%) had monoostotic Paget's 
      disease. More commonly involved bones were skull and spine (61.9%) followed by 
      pelvis (38.1%), femur (33.3%), tibia (9%) and ulna (9%). Mean (+/-SD) serum 
      alkaline phosphatase at diagnosis was 1514 +/- 1168 IU/L and nine months after 
      treatment with bisphosphonates decreased to 454 +/- 406 IU/ L(P<0.03). 
      CONCLUSION: This illustrates that Paget's disease does exist in India and a high 
      index of suspicion is required to clinch the diagnosis.
