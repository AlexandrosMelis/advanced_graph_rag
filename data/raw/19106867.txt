TI  - [The Main Gate Syndrome: a new format in mass-casualty victim "surge" 
      management?].

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent suicide bombings pose the novel problem for Trauma Centers 
      of the massive simultaneous arrival of many gravely wounded patients. METHODS: We 
      report the experience of the French-German Military Trauma Group, a Level 2 
      Trauma Center, in Afghanistan during the wave of suicide bombings in February 
      2007. RESULTS: Fourteen casualties were received. A first triage was carried out 
      by the U S Army Level I group prior to evacuation. A second surgical triage was 
      carried out with systematic ultrasound exam. Four cases (ISS>25) were 
      re-categorized and underwent emergency surgical procedures. CONCLUSION: Suicide 
      bombing in crowded locations near an evacuation hospital may overwhelm the 
      medical resources of the receiving center. It has been referred to as "The Main 
      Gate Syndrome." We introduced the novel concept of a semi-evacuation hospital or 
      receiving center where a second surgical triage was carried out. These 
      exceptional circumstances require open-minded flexibility, a tailored approach, 
      and close cooperation between surgeons and anesthetists to share experience, 
      opinions, and ideas. In the setting of mass casualties, emergency ultrasound exam 
      was shown to be a valuable and effective tool by virtue of its mobility, 
      reproducibility, and immediate results.
