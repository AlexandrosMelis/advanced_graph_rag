AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between the use of an endoscope during 
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) procedures and infection remains poorly defined. 
      In this study, we sought to analyze whether the simultaneous use of an endoscope 
      could in fact increase the infection rate associated with VPS procedures. 
      METHODS: This study included 438 VPS procedures, 49 in which an endoscope was 
      used (11.2%) and 389 in which an endoscope was not used (88.8%). The infection 
      rates in these 2 main groups were calculated and compared. Subsequently, 4 new 
      groups were created, composed of patients with a shunt inserted for the first 
      time (groups 1A and 1B) and patients with a shunt reviewed or inserted for a 
      second time (groups 2A and 2B). Groups 1A and 2A comprised patients in whom an 
      endoscope was used simultaneously with VPS surgery, and groups 1B and 2B 
      comprised patients in whom an endoscope was not used. These groups were compared 
      to determine the infection rate. RESULTS: The overall infection rate was 18.5%, 
      including 22.4% in the groups in which an endoscope was used and 18% in those in 
      which an endoscope was not used (P = 0.449). Groups 1A and 1B and groups 2A and 
      2B were matched for possible intervening risk factors. The infection rate was 
      28.6% in group 1A and 16.2% in group 1B (P = 0.27), and 20% in group 2A and 19.8% 
      in group 2B (P = 0.977). CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the use of an 
      endoscope during VPS procedures did not increase the risk of surgical infection.
