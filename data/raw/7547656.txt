TI  - Does continuous intravenous infusion of low-concentration epinephrine impair 
      uterine blood flow in pregnant ewes?
PG  - 206-11
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bolus intravenous injection of epinephrine can 
      decrease uterine blood flow. This study examined the effects of intravenous 
      infusion of epinephrine on uterine blood flow in the gravid ewe. METHODS: 
      Maternal and fetal vascular catheters and a maternal electromagnetic uterine 
      artery flow probe were implanted in 10 near-term gravid ewes. After recovery, 
      saline, 0.125% bupivacaine, 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine, 0.125% 
      bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine, and 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:800,000 
      epinephrine were infused into the maternal superior vena cava. Drugs were infused 
      at 10 mL/h for 30 minutes and then at 20 mL/h for an additional 30 minutes. 
      Animals also received an intravenous bolus of epinephrine 15 micrograms. 
      Throughout all infusions, maternal heart rate, systemic and pulmonary blood 
      pressures, uterine blood flow, cardiac output, and acid-base balance were 
      measured, as well as fetal heart rate, blood pressure, and acid-base balance. 
      RESULTS: Epinephrine 15 micrograms decreased uterine blood flow to 68 +/- 14% of 
      baseline (mean +/- SD). Infusion of all solutions had no effect on any measured 
      hemodynamic variable. CONCLUSIONS: In gravid ewes, intravenous infusion of < or = 
      1.67 micrograms/min epinephrine altered neither maternal hemodynamics nor uterine 
      blood flow. To the extent that sheep data can be extrapolated to humans, these 
      results suggest that continuous intravenous infusion of epinephrine in local 
      anesthetic solutions is safe if the epidural catheter should enter a blood vessel 
      during the infusion.
