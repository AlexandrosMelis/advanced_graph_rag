      we seeing the real picture?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adhesive capsulitis is often difficult to diagnose in its early stage 
      and to differentiate from other common shoulder disorders. OBJECTIVE: The aim of 
      this study was to validate any or all of the 8 clinical identifiers of 
      early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis established in an earlier 
      Delphi study. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Sixty-four 
      patients diagnosed with early-stage adhesive capsulitis by a physical therapist 
      or medical practitioner were included in the study. Eight active and 8 passive 
      shoulder movements and visual analog scale pain scores for each movement were 
      recorded prior to and immediately following an intra-articular injection of 
      corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Using the local anesthetic as the reference 
      standard, pain relief of >/=70% for passive external rotation was deemed a positive 
      anesthetic response (PAR). RESULTS: Sixteen participants (25%) demonstrated a 
      PAR. Univariate logistic regression identified that of the proposed identifiers, 
      global loss of passive range of movement (odds ratio [OR]=0.26, P=.03), pain at 
      the end of range of all measured active movements (OR=0.06, P=.02), and global 
      loss of passive glenohumeral movements (OR=0.23, P=.02) were associated with a 
      PAR. Following stepwise removal of the variables, pain at the end of range of all 
      measured active movements remained the only identifier but was associated with 
      reduced odds of a PAR. LIMITATIONS: The lack of a recognized reference standard 
      for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related 
      research. CONCLUSIONS: None of the clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive 
      capsulitis previously proposed by expert consensus have been validated in this 
      study. Clinicians should be aware that commonly used clinical identifiers may not 
      be applicable to this stage.
