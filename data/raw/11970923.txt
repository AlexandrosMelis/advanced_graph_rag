TI  - Convulsions and retinal haemorrhage: should we look further?
PG  - 334-5
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The prevalence of retinal haemorrhages after convulsions is 
      not well established. As these haemorrhages are considered characteristic of 
      child abuse, we investigated their occurrence after convulsive episodes to see 
      whether the finding of haemorrhage should prompt further investigation. METHODS: 
      Prospective study of 153 children (aged 2 months to 2 years), seen in the 
      emergency department after a convulsive episode. After a thorough history and 
      physical examination, a retinal examination was performed by an ophthalmologist. 
      If findings were positive, further investigation was undertaken to rule out 
      systemic disorder or child abuse. RESULTS: One child was found with unilateral 
      retinal haemorrhages following an episode of a simple febrile convulsion. A 
      thorough investigation uncovered no other reason for this finding. CONCLUSION: 
      Retinal haemorrhages following a convulsive episode are rare. Such a finding 
      should trigger an extensive search for other reasons, including child abuse.
