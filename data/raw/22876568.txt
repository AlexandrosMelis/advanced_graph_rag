TI  - Is vitamin D deficiency a feature of pediatric celiac disease?
PG  - 607-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy characterized by 
      villus atrophy and malabsorption of essential nutrients. Vitamin D deficiency has 
      been described in autoimmune diseases, but its status in prepubertal children 
      with CD has not been adequately studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the vitamin D 
      status of prepubertal children with CD. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 
      prepubertal children aged 3-12 years with CD (n=24) who were compared to 
      prepubertal, non-CD children of the same age (n=50). Children were included in 
      the study if they had a diagnosis of CD by intestinal biopsy, and were not on a 
      gluten-free diet (GFD). Patients were excluded if they had diseases of calcium or 
      vitamin D metabolism, or were receiving calcium or vitamin D supplementation or 
      had other autoimmune diseases. All subjects had their serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
      [25(OH)D] level measured. RESULTS: There was no difference in 25(OH)D level 
      between the CD and non-CD children (27.58 +/- 9.91 versus 26.20 +/- 10.45, p = 
      0.59). However, when the patients were subdivided into obese and non-obese 
      groups, the non-obese CD patients had a significantly higher 25(OH)D level than 
      the obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 21.58 +/- 5.67, p = 0.009). In 
      contrast, there was no difference in 25(OH)D level between non-obese CD patients 
      and non-obese normal children (28.39 +/- 10.26 versus 30.64 +/-12.08, p = 0.52). 
      The season of 25(OH)D measurement was not a significant confounder (p =0.7). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed no difference in 25(OH) D levels between normal 
      children and those with CD when adjusted for body mass index.
