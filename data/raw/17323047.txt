TI  - Does invasive diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia during off-hours delay treatment?
PG  - 734-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined whether invasive lung-specimen collection-to-treatment 
      times for intensive care unit patients with suspected ventilator-associated 
      pneumonia (VAP) differ with to the work shift during which specimens were 
      collected. We compared weekday day shifts and off-hours (from 6:30 p.m. to 8:29 
      a.m. the next day for night shifts, from Saturday 1:00 p.m. to Monday 8:29 a.m. 
      for weekends, and from 8:30 a.m. to 8:29 a.m. the following morning for public 
      holidays). DESIGN AND SETTING: Single-center, observational study in the 
      intensive care unit in an academic teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      101 patients who developed 152 episodes of bacteriologically confirmed VAP. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Of the 152 VAP episodes 66 were diagnosed during 
      off-hours. Neither more bronchoscopy complications nor more inappropriate initial 
      antimicrobial treatments for patients were observed between day and off-hour 
      shifts. Indeed, the overall time from brochoalveolar lavage to antibiotic 
      administration was shorter for off-hours than day-shifts due to shorter specimen 
      collection-to-antibiotic prescription times, but antibiotic 
      prescription-to-administration times were the same. CONCLUSIONS: An invasive 
      strategy based on bronchoscopy to diagnose VAP was not associated with a longer 
      time to first appropriate antibiotic administration when clinical suspicion of 
      VAP occurs during off-hours.
