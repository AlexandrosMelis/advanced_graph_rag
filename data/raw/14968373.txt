TI  - Can CT predict the level of CSF block in tuberculous hydrocephalus?
PG  - 183-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment of obstructive hydrocephalus in children with tuberculous 
      meningitis (TBM) depends on the level of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) block. 
      Air-encephalography is regarded as the gold standard for differentiating 
      communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus. Since air-encephalography 
      involves a lumbar puncture, it carries the risk of cerebral herniation. AIM. The 
      aim of this study was to determine whether communicating and non-communicating 
      hydrocephalus in TBM can be differentiated by means of cranial computerised 
      tomography (CT). METHODS: A number of CT indices were measured in 50 children 
      with communicating and 34 children with non-communicating hydrocephalus according 
      to air-encephalographic findings. RESULTS: The only CT finding that correlated 
      with the type of hydrocephalus was the shape of the third ventricle. 
      Significantly more children with non-communicating hydrocephalus had a rounded 
      third ventricle than those with communicating hydrocephalus. CONCLUSION: CT is 
      therefore not useful in determining the level of CSF block in TBM. 
      Air-encephalography remains the most reliable way of determining the level of CSF 
      obstruction.
