AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of 
      corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery. METHODS: Histologic, 
      ultrastructural, and cohesive tensile strength evaluations were performed on 25 
      normal human corneal specimens, 206 uncomplicated LASIK specimens, 17 
      uncomplicated sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK) specimens, 4 uncomplicated 
      photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) specimens, 2 uncomplicated advanced surface 
      ablation (ASA) specimens, 5 keratoconus specimens, 12 postoperative LASIK ectasia 
      specimens, and 1 postoperative PRK ectasia specimen and compared to previously 
      published studies. RESULTS: Histologic and ultrastructural studies of normal 
      corneas showed significant differences in the direction of collagen fibrils 
      and/or the degree of lamellar interweaving in Bowman's layer, the anterior third 
      of the corneal stroma, the posterior two-thirds of the corneal stroma, and 
      Descemet's membrane. Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these 
      morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were 
      located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and 
      secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with 
      regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human 
      corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser 
      keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due 
      to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for 
      corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal 
      haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring. In 
      contrast, similar to conventional LASIK, SBK still has the short- and long-term 
      potential for interface wound complications from the hypocellular primitive 
      stromal scar. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show 
      that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery 
      compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining 
      corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. 
      However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.
