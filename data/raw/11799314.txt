TI  - Is external palliative radiotherapy for gallbladder carcinoma effective?
PG  - 581-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gallbladder carcinoma is characterized by delayed diagnosis, 
      ineffective treatment and poor prognosis. Surgical resection has been thought to 
      be the treatment of choice, while the role of radiotherapy as adjuvant or 
      palliative treatment has not been fully clarified in the literature. PATIENT AND 
      METHODS: We present the case of a 45-year-old female, with unresectable 
      gallbladder carcinoma, grade IV, histologically diagnosed during laparotomy. The 
      patient was treated with palliative intent with percutaneous transhepatic biliary 
      drainage. Furthermore, she received external radiotherapy by (60)Co, using a 
      three-field technique (anterior-posterior and right lateral). The total dose was 
      3,000 cGy in 10 fractions, with 300 cGy per fraction, 5 days weekly. RESULTS: The 
      patient showed clinico-laboratory improvement and was discharged with a permanent 
      percutaneous transhepatic endoprosthesis. During follow-up (10 and 12 months 
      postirradiation), abdominal CTs showed no local extension of the tumor, while the 
      patient had a good performance status. So far, 1 year after the diagnosis of 
      gallbladder cancer she is still alive. CONCLUSIONS: External radiotherapy seems 
      to be a safe and effective method of palliative management of gallbladder 
      carcinoma. However, further studies are necessary to determine the role of 
      radiotherapy in palliative or adjuvant treatment of gallbladder carcinoma.
