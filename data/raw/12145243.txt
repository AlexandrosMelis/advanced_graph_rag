TI  - Are lower fasting plasma glucose levels at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 
      associated with improved outcomes?: U.K. prospective diabetes study 61.
PG  - 1410-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes may be present for several years before diagnosis, by 
      which time many patients have already developed diabetic complications. Earlier 
      detection and treatment may reduce this burden, but evidence to support this 
      approach is lacking. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Glycemic control and clinical 
      and surrogate outcomes were compared for 5,088 of 5,102 U.K. Diabetes Prospective 
      Study participants according to whether they had low (<140 mg/dl [<7.8 mmol/l]), 
      intermediate (140 to <180 mg/dl [7.8 to <10.0 mmol/l]), or high (> or =180 mg/dl 
      [> or =10 mmol/l]) fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels at diagnosis. Individuals 
      who presented with and without diabetic symptoms were also compared. RESULTS: 
      Fewer people with FPG in the lowest category had retinopathy, abnormal 
      biothesiometer measurements, or reported erectile dysfunction. The rate of 
      increase in FPG and HbA(1c) during the study was identical in all three groups, 
      although absolute differences persisted. Individuals in the low FPG group had a 
      significantly reduced risk for each predefined clinical outcome except stroke, 
      whereas those in the intermediate group had significantly reduced risk for each 
      outcome except stroke and myocardial infarction. The low and intermediate FPG 
      groups had a significantly reduced risk for progression of retinopathy, reduction 
      in vibration sensory threshold, or development of microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: 
      People presenting with type 2 diabetes with lower initial glycemia who may be 
      earlier in the course of their disease had fewer adverse clinical outcomes 
      despite similar glycemic progression. Since most such people are asymptomatic at 
      diagnosis, active case detection programs would be required to identify them.
