AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy afflicting women, and the 
      most common cancer overall in Jordan. A woman's decision to go for screening is 
      influenced by her social support network. This study aims to explore Jordanian 
      men's individual and contextual perspectives on women's breast cancer and their 
      own role in the breast health of the females within their families. METHODS: An 
      explorative qualitative design was used to purposively recruit 24 married men 
      aged 27 to 65 years (median 43 years) from four governorates in Jordan. Data in 
      the form of interviews transcriptions was subjected to qualitative content 
      analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: a) Supporting one's wife; b) 
      Marital needs and obligations; c) Constrained by a culture of destiny and shame. 
      The first theme was built on men's feelings of responsibility for the family's 
      health and well-being, their experiences of encouraging their wives to seek 
      health care and their providing counselling and instrumental support. The second 
      theme emerged from men's views about other men's rejection of a wife inflicted by 
      breast cancer, their own perceptions of diminished femininity due to mastectomy 
      and their own concerns about protecting the family from the hereditary risk of 
      breast cancer. The third theme was seen in men's perception of breast cancer as 
      an inevitable act of God that is far away from one's own family, in associating 
      breast cancer with improper behaviour and in their readiness to face the culture 
      of Eib (shame). CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian men perceive themselves as having a vital 
      role in supporting, guiding and encouraging their wives to follow breast cancer 
      early detection recommendations. Breast health awareness campaigns could involve 
      husbands to capitalize on family support.
