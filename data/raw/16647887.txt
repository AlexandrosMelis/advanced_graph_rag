TI  - Are women who are treated for hypothyroidism at risk for pregnancy complications?
PG  - e1-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes that are 
      associated with pregnancy and treated hypothyroidism. STUDY DESIGN: This was a 
      retrospective cohort study of all women who received prenatal care and were 
      delivered at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1989 and 2001. 
      All patients with hypothyroidism diagnosed before pregnancy or early in pregnancy 
      were identified. Maternal, fetal, and obstetric outcomes were then collected and 
      analyzed for women with hypothyroidism and compared with women without 
      hypothyroidism. RESULTS: Among 20,499 deliveries, there were 419 women (2.1%) who 
      were treated for hypothyroidism during the study period. Hypothyroidism was more 
      common among women > or =35 years old, white women, and women without Medicaid 
      insurance. Treated hypothyroidism was not associated with any increase in 
      maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications. In addition, hypothyroidism did not 
      affect mode of delivery. CONCLUSION: Compared with patients without 
      hypothyroidism, patients with treated hypothyroidism are not at any increased 
      risk for perinatal morbidity.
