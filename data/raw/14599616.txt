TI  - Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably?
PG  - 509-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphedema may be identified by simpler circumference changes as 
      compared with changes in limb volume. METHODS: Ninety breast cancer patients were 
      prospectively enrolled in an academic trial, and seven upper extremity 
      circumferences were measured quarterly for 3 years. A 10% volume increase or 
      greater than 1 cm increase in arm circumference identified lymphedema with 
      verification by a lymphedema specialist. Sensitivity and specificity of several 
      different criteria for detecting lymphedema were compared using the academic 
      trial as the standard. RESULTS: Thirty-nine cases of lymphedema were identified 
      by the academic trial. Using a 10% increase in circumference at two sites as the 
      criterion, half the lymphedema cases were detected (sensitivity 37%). When using 
      a 10% increase in circumference at any site, 74.4% of cases were detected 
      (sensitivity 49%). Detection by a 5% increase in circumference at any site was 
      91% sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: An increase of 5% in circumference measurements 
      identified the most potential lymphedema cases compared with an academic trial.
