TI  - Are failures of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction associated with steep 
      posterior tibial slopes? A case control study.
PG  - 2649-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, increasing number of literature has identified the 
      posterior tibial slope (PTS) as one of the risk factors of primary anterior 
      cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. However, few studies concerning the association 
      between failure of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and PTS have been published. The 
      objective of this study was to explore the association between the failure of 
      ACLR and PTS at a minimum of two years follow-up. METHODS: Two hundred and thirty 
      eight eligible patients from June 2009 to October 2010 were identified from our 
      database. A total of 20 failure cases of ACLR and 20 randomly selected controls 
      were included in this retrospective study. The demographic data and the results 
      of manual maximum side-to-side difference with KT-1000 arthrometer at 30 degrees  of knee 
      flexion and pivot-shift test before the ACLR and at the final follow-up were 
      collected. The medial and lateral PTSs were measured using the magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) scan, based on Hudek's measurement. A comparison of PTS between the 
      two groups was performed. RESULTS: The overall failure rate of the present study 
      was 8.4%. Of the 40 participants, the mean medial PTS was 4.1 degrees  +/- 3.2 degrees  and the 
      mean lateral PTS was 4.6 degrees  +/- 2.6 degrees . The medial PTS of the ACLR failure group was 
      significantly steeper than the control group (3.5 degrees  +/- 2.5 degrees  vs. 6.1 degrees  +/- 2.1 degrees , P = 
      0.000). Similarly, the lateral PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly 
      steeper than the control group (2.9 degrees  +/- 2.1 degrees  vs. 5.5 degrees  +/- 3.0 degrees , P = 0.006). For 
      medial PTS >/= 5 degrees , the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 6.8 (P = 0.007); for lateral 
      PTS >/=5 degrees , the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 10.8 (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Both 
      medial and lateral PTS were significantly steeper in failures of ACLR than the 
      control group. Medial or lateral PTS >/=5 degrees  was a new risk factor of ACLR failure.
