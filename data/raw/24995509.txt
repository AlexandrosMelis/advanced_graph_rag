TI  - HIF1A as a major vascular endothelial growth factor regulator: do its 
      polymorphisms have an association with age-related macular degeneration?

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the association between age-related macular 
      degeneration (AMD) and the polymorphisms of HIF1A, a major vascular epithelial 
      growth factor regulator under hypoxic conditions. The associations of AMD and 
      polymorphisms of genes CFH, SKIV2L and MYRIP were also studied. DESIGN: 
      Prospective study. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven AMD patients and 80 healthy 
      subjects admitted to the Department of Ophthalmology at Pamukkale University 
      Hospital, Denizli, Turkey, were included: 45 (52%) had wet type AMD, and 42 (48%) 
      had dry type AMD. METHODS: Polymorphisms rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), 
      rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and rs11549467 (HIF1A) were investigated in 
      DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples of the cases and controls by 
      dye-termination DNA sequencing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Genotype distribution of 
      rs1061170 (CFH), rs429608 (SKIV2L), rs2679798 (MYRIP) and both rs11549465 and 
      rs11549467 (HIF1A) in AMD cases and healthy controls; association between 
      genotypes and AMD subtypes. RESULTS: Given the significant difference between the 
      mean age of case and control groups (72.13 +/- 5.77 vs. 62.80 +/- 5.22, respectively) 
      (P = .000), subsequent analyses were adjusted for age. We found that having at 
      least one C allele for polymorphism rs1061170 increases AMD risk independent of 
      age (OR = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22-4.81). The ancestral T allele 
      for polymorphism rs1061170 has a protective effect for AMD (OR = 0.53, 95% CI, 
      0.34-0.83). No statistically significant difference for distributions of other 
      single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) emerged between patients and healthy 
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: No associations appeared between HIF1A SNPs and AMD, which 
      were studied here for the first time; however, polymorphism rs1061170 of the CFH 
      gene is associated with AMD in our population.
