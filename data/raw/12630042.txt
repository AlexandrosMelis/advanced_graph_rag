TI  - Does body mass index (BMI) influence morbidity and long-term survival in gastric 
      cancer patients after gastrectomy?
PG  - 284-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The long-term survival of patients with gastric cancer is 
      governed by various factors, such as the clinical stage of the cancer, the 
      patient's nutritional state, and the treatment and may be governed by the volume 
      of intraperitoneal adipose tissue. The aim of this study is to clarify the 
      relationship between the degree of the patients' body mass index and their 
      long-term survival. METHODOLOGY: Gastric cancer patients who had undergone a 
      gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy and with resection A and B according to the 
      criteria of the Japanese Research Society for Gastric Cancer Rules were 
      subgrouped into those patients with a body mass index < 0.185 (the lower body 
      mass index group) and those patients with a body mass index > 0.210 (the higher 
      body mass index group). The patient's morbidity and long-term survival rate was 
      retrospectively compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: A significantly longer 
      mean survival rate was observed for the lower body mass index group in stage 2 
      (1667 vs. 1322 days, P = 0.0240). Also, a significantly longer mean survival rate 
      was observed for the higher BMI group in stage 3a (1431 vs. 943, P = 0.0071). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The body mass index is one of the prognostic factors of stage 2 and 
      stage 3a gastric cancer. However, it does not appear to be useful for determining 
      the prognosis of stage 1a, 1b, 3b, and 4a gastric cancers.
