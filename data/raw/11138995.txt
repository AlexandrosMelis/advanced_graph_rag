TI  - Is alexithymia a risk factor for unexplained physical symptoms in general medical 
      outpatients?
PG  - 768-78
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alexithymia is presumed to play an important predisposing role in the 
      pathogenesis of medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, no research on 
      alexithymia has been done among general medical outpatients who present with 
      medically unexplained physical symptoms as their main problem and in which 
      anxiety and depression have been considered as possible confounding factors. This 
      study investigated whether patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms 
      are more alexithymic than those with explained symptoms and whether, in patients 
      with unexplained symptoms, alexithymia is associated with subjective health 
      experience and use of medical services. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional 
      study among patients attending an internal medicine outpatient clinic. All 
      patients were given a standardized interview and completed a number of 
      questionnaires. RESULTS: After complete physical examinations, 169 of 321 
      patients had unexplained physical symptoms according to two independent raters. 
      Patients with medically unexplained symptoms more often had a mental disorder, 
      but overall they were not more alexithymic. In patients with unexplained physical 
      symptoms, alexithymia was not associated with subjective health experience or use 
      of medical services. However, patients with both unexplained symptoms and a 
      mental disorder who also denied any possible connection between emotional 
      problems and their physical symptoms did have more alexithymic traits. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In the majority of patients with medically unexplained physical 
      symptoms, alexithymia does not play a role of clinical significance. Patients 
      with unexplained physical symptoms are heterogeneous with respect to psychiatric 
      syndrome pathology and probably also with respect to personality pathology.
