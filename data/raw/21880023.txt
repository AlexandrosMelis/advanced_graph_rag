AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study whether exercise during pregnancy reduces the risk of 
      postnatal depression.  DESIGN:  Randomized controlled trial.  SETTING:  Trondheim 
      and Stavanger University Hospitals, Norway.  POPULATION AND SAMPLE:  Eight 
      hundred and fifty-five pregnant women were randomized to intervention or control 
      groups.  METHODS:  The intervention was a 12 week exercise program, including 
      aerobic and strengthening exercises, conducted between week 20 and 36 of 
      pregnancy. One weekly group session was led by physiotherapists, and home 
      exercises were encouraged twice a week. Control women received regular antenatal 
      care.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 
      completed three months after birth. Scores of 10 or more and 13 or more suggested 
      probable minor and major depression, respectively.  RESULTS:  Fourteen of 379 
      (3.7%) women in the intervention group and 17 of 340 (5.0%) in the control group 
      had an EPDS score of >/=10 (p=0.46), and four of 379 (1.2%) women in the 
      intervention group and eight of 340 (2.4%) in the control group had an EPDS score 
      of >/=13 (p=0.25). Among women who did not exercise prior to pregnancy, two of 100 
      (2.0%) women in the intervention group and nine of 95 (9.5%) in the control group 
      had an EPDS score of >/=10 (p=0.03).  CONCLUSIONS:  We did not find a lower 
      prevalence of high EPDS scores among women randomized to regular exercise during 
      pregnancy compared with the control group. However, a subgroup of women in the 
      intervention group who did not exercise regularly prior to pregnancy had a 
      reduced risk of postnatal depression.
