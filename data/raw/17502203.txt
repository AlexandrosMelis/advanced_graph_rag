TI  - Cholestasis associated with small bowel atresia: do we always need to 
      investigate?
PG  - 873-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Cholestasis occurs frequently in patients with small bowel 
      atresia (SBA) and is often attributed to prolonged parental nutrition. When 
      severe or prolonged, patients may undergo unnecessary intensive or invasive 
      investigation. We characterized cholestasis and analyzed the pertinence of 
      investigating this patient population. METHODS: With Research Ethics Board 
      approval, patients with SBA between 1996 and 2005 were retrospectively reviewed. 
      Demographics, location of atresia, operative findings, complications, 
      investigations, resumption of feeding, duration of prolonged parental nutrition, 
      and follow-up information were examined. Cholestasis was evaluated for incidence, 
      severity, and evolution. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (29 male, 26 female), with 
      a median gestational age and birth weight of 36 weeks and 2025 g, respectively, 
      were reviewed. Care was withdrawn for 2 patients before repair. For the remaining 
      53 patients, SBA were duodenal atresia in 18, jejunoileal atresia in 32, and 
      multiple atresia in 3. Of 53, 24 (45%) patients developed cholestasis 
      postoperatively (direct/total bilirubin >20%). All patients with short bowel (4) 
      and 60% (6/10) of patients with a delay of enteral feeding more than 14 days 
      postoperatively had cholestasis. Ten patients (36%) proceeded with in-depth 
      evaluations for cholestasis, with 8 (28%) undergoing liver biopsy. No patient had 
      biliary atresia. No deaths were related to isolated cholestasis/cirrhosis. 
      Cholestasis resolved spontaneously in all the survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Small bowel 
      atresia is frequently associated with postoperative cholestasis that will resolve 
      with time. We recommend a more selective and expectant approach to SBA-associated 
      cholestasis to minimize unnecessary investigations.
