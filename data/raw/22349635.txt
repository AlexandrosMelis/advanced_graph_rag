AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of elderly cancer patients has gained importance. One 
      question regarding the treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) is 
      whether elderly patients benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy? In 
      attempting to answer this question, we performed a matched-pair analysis 
      comparing surgery followed by radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Data from 42 elderly (age > 65 years) patients receiving surgery plus 
      radiotherapy (S + RT) were matched to 84 patients (1:2) receiving radiotherapy 
      alone (RT). Groups were matched for ten potential prognostic factors and compared 
      regarding motor function, local control, and survival. Additional matched-pair 
      analyses were performed for the subgroups of patients receiving direct 
      decompressive surgery plus stabilization of involved vertebrae (DDSS, n = 81) and 
      receiving laminectomy (LE, n = 45). RESULTS: Improvement of motor function 
      occurred in 21% after S + RT and 24% after RT (p = 0.39). The 1-year local 
      control rates were 81% and 91% (p = 0.44), while the 1-year survival rates were 
      46% and 39% (p = 0.71). In the matched-pair analysis of patients receiving DDSS, 
      improvement of motor function occurred in 22% after DDSS + RT and 24% after RT 
      alone (p = 0.92). The 1-year local control rates were 95% and 89% (p = 0.62), and 
      the 1-year survival rates were 54% and 43% (p = 0.30). In the matched-pair 
      analysis of patients receiving LE, improvement of motor function occurred in 20% 
      after LE + RT and 23% after RT alone (p = 0.06). The 1-year local control rates 
      were 50% and 92% (p = 0.33). The 1-year survival rates were 32% and 32% 
      (p = 0.55). CONCLUSION: Elderly patients with MSCC did not benefit from surgery 
      in addition to radiotherapy regarding functional outcome, local control of MSCC, 
      or survival.
