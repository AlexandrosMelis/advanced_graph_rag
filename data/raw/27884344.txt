AB  - BACKGROUND: This study sought to compare general surgery research residents' 
      survey information regarding self-efficacy ratings to their observed performance 
      during a simulated small bowel repair. Their observed performance ratings were 
      based on their leadership skills in directing their assistant. METHODS: 
      Participants were given 15 min to perform a bowel repair using bovine intestines 
      with standardized injuries. Operative assistants were assigned to help assist 
      with the repair. Before the procedure, participants were asked to rate their 
      expected skills decay, task difficulty, and confidence in addressing the small 
      bowel injury. Interactions were coded to identify the number of instructions 
      given by the participants to the assistant during the repair. Statistical 
      analyses assessed the relationship between the number of directional instructions 
      and participants' perceptions self-efficacy measures. Directional instructions 
      were defined as any dialog by the participant who guided the assistant to perform 
      an action. RESULTS: Thirty-six residents (58.3% female) participated in the 
      study. Participants who rated lower levels of decay in their intraoperative 
      decision-making and small bowel repair skills were noted to use their assistant 
      more by giving more instructions. Similarly, a higher number of instructions 
      correlated with lower perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, 
      suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task. CONCLUSIONS: General 
      surgery research residents' intraoperative leadership skills showed significant 
      correlations to their perceptions of skill decay and task difficulty during a 
      bowel repair. Evaluating resident's directional instructions may provide an 
      additional individualized intraoperative assessment metric. Further evaluation 
      relating to operative performance outcomes is warranted.
