TI  - Are hepatitis G virus and TT virus involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease?
PG  - 53-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis G virus can cause chronic infection in man but the role of 
      this agent in chronic liver disease is poorly understood. Little is known about 
      the relation of another newly discovered agent, the TT virus, with chronic liver 
      disease. AIM: To investigate the rate of infection with hepatitis G virus and TT 
      virus in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease. PATIENTS: A total of 23 
      subjects with chronically raised alanine transaminase and a liver biopsy in whom 
      all known causes of liver disease had been excluded, and 40 subjects with 
      hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. METHODS: Evaluation of 
      anti-hepatitis G virus by enzyme immunoassay. Hepatitis G virus-RNA by polymerase 
      chain reaction with primers from the 5' NC and NS5a regions. TT virus-DNA by 
      nested polymerase chain reaction with primers from the ORF1 region. Results. 
      Hepatitis G virus-RNA was detected in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic 
      chronic hepatitis and in 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis 
      (17.4% vs 15% p=ns). At least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection 
      (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus, mostly mutually exclusive) 
      was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic hepatitis and 16 out of 40 
      with hepatitis C virus liver disease (26. 1% vs 40% p=ns). T virus-DNA was 
      present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C 
      virus-related chronic liver disease. Demographic and clinical features, including 
      stage and grade of liver histology, were comparable between hepatitis G 
      virus-infected and uninfected subjects. Severe liver damage [chronic hepatitis 
      with fibrosis or cirrhosis) were significantly more frequent in subjects with 
      hepatitis C virus liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: In Southern Italy, hepatitis G 
      virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, 
      independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with 
      cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic 
      liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus 
      infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related 
      liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.
