TI  - Is bicompartmental knee arthroplasty more favourable to knee muscle strength and 
      physical performance compared to total knee arthroplasty?

AB  - PURPOSE: Bicompartmental knee arthroplasty features bone and ligament sparing as 
      unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and is presumably better in the recovery of 
      muscle strength and function compared to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) though not 
      previously reported in the literature. The aim of the study was to compare 
      isokinetic knee muscle strength and physical performance in patients who 
      underwent either bicompartmental knee arthroplasty or TKA. METHODS: Each of 24 
      patients (31 knees) was prospectively examined preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months 
      after each surgery. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength as well as 
      position sense were measured using the Biodex system. Timed up and go test, stair 
      climbing test, and the 6-min walk test were used to assess physical performance. 
      The results of each group were also compared with those from the corresponding 
      healthy control, respectively. RESULTS: Demography showed significant difference 
      in the mean age between bicompartment (54.8 +/- 5.6 years) and TKA groups (65.7 +/- 
      6.7 years). Comparing between the two groups, knee extensor and flexor torque, 
      hamstring/Quadriceps ratio, position sense, and physical performance were not 
      significantly different preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months after surgery. In 
      intra-group analysis, muscle strength and position sense at each time point were 
      not different in both groups. In physical performance, both groups resulted in 
      improvement in the 6-min walk test, and only TKA group showed enhancement in 
      stair climbing test. CONCLUSIONS: Although theoretically plausible, 
      bicompartmental knee arthroplasty was not superior in knee muscle strength and 
      physical performance at 1 year compared with total knee arthroplasty.
