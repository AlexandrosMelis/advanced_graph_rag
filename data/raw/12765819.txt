TI  - Spinal subdural hematoma: a sequela of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm?
PG  - 408-12; discussion 412
AB  - BACKGROUND: A case of spinal subdural hematoma (SSDH) following subarachnoid 
      hemorrhage (SAH) because of a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm is described. 
      Such a case has never been reported. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old woman 
      underwent a craniotomy for a ruptured internal carotid aneurysm. A computed 
      tomography scan showed that SAH existed predominantly in the posterior fossa and 
      subdural hematoma beneath the cerebellar tentorium. Intrathecal administration of 
      urokinase, IV administration of fasudil hydrochloride, and continuous 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evacuation via cisternal drainage were performed as 
      prophylactic treatments for vasospasm. On the sixth postoperative day, the 
      patient complained of severe lower back and buttock pain. Magnetic resonance 
      imaging showed a subdural hematoma in the lumbosacral region. Although the mass 
      effect was extensive, the patient showed no neurologic symptoms other than the 
      sciatica. She was treated conservatively. The hematoma dissolved gradually and 
      had diminished completely 15 weeks later. Her pain gradually subsided, and she 
      was discharged 7 weeks later without any neurologic deficit. CONCLUSION: Although 
      the exact mechanism of SSDH in this case is unclear, we speculate that this SSDH 
      was a hematoma that migrated from the intracranial subdural space. Low CSF 
      pressure because of continuous drainage and intrathecal thrombolytic therapy may 
      have played an important role in the migration of the hematoma through the spinal 
      canal. It is important to recognize the SSDH as a possible complication of the 
      SAH accompanied with intracranial subdural hematoma.
