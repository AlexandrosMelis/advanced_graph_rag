TI  - Cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy 
      mechanism: are clinical predictors adequate?
PG  - 170-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have identified clinical predictors to guide radiologic 
      evaluation of the cervical spine in geriatric patients. We hypothesized that 
      clinical predictors are not adequate in the identification of cervical spine 
      fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism. METHODS: 
      A retrospective case-control study was performed on geriatric blunt trauma 
      patients sustaining low-energy trauma from January 2000 to January 2006. A data 
      form including 8 clinical predictors was completed for each group. RESULTS: There 
      were 35 study and 64 control patients identified. Both groups were similar in age 
      (study 83.6 vs control 81.2) and injury severity score (study 9.06 vs control 
      9.61). Only neck tenderness exceeded the expected occurrence in the presence of a 
      cervical spine injury (chi(2) = 18.1, P = .001) in just 45.5% of the study group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Clinical predictors appear inadequate for the evaluation of the 
      cervical spine in geriatric trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.
