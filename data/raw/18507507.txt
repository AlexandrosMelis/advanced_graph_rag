AB  - BACKGROUND: Specialty pharmaceuticals have evolved beyond their status as niche 
      drugs designed to treat rare conditions and are now poised to become the standard 
      of care in a wide variety of common chronic illnesses. Due in part to the cost of 
      these therapies, payers are increasingly demanding evidence of their value. 
      Determining the value of these medications is hampered by a lack of robust 
      pharmacoeconomic data. OBJECTIVE: To outline emerging strategies and case study 
      examples for the medical and pharmacy benefits management of specialty 
      pharmaceuticals. SUMMARY: The promise of specialty pharmaceuticals: increased 
      life expectancy, improved quality of life, enhanced workplace productivity, 
      decreased burden of disease, and reduced health care spending comes at a 
      significant cost. These agents require special handling, administration, patient 
      education, clinical support, and risk mitigation. Additionally, specialty drugs 
      require distribution systems that ensure appropriate patient selection and data 
      collection. With the specialty pharmaceutical pipeline overflowing with new 
      medicines and an aging population increasingly relying on these novel treatments 
      to treat common diseases, the challenge of managing the costs associated with 
      these agents can be daunting. Aided by sophisticated pharmacoeconomic models to 
      assess value, the cost impacts of these specialty drugs can be appropriately 
      controlled. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that when used in targeted 
      patient populations, specialty pharmaceuticals may represent a good health care 
      value.
