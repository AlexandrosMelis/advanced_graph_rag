TI  - Diabetes mellitus among Swedish art glass workers--an effect of arsenic exposure?
PG  - 146-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to search for evidence of an 
      association between occupational arsenic exposure and diabetes mellitus, as 
      implied by the relation of this disease to arsenic in drinking water in a recent 
      study from Taiwan. METHODS: A case-referent analysis on death records of 5498 
      individuals in the art glass producing part of southeastern Sweden was performed. 
      Out of all the enrolled subjects, 888 were glass workers. According to 
      occupational title, glassblowers, foundry workers, and unspecified workers were 
      regarded as potentially exposed to arsenic. Persons with a diagnosis of diabetes 
      mellitus either as an underlying or contributing cause of death were considered 
      cases. Referents were decedents without any indication of cancer, cardiovascular 
      disease, or diabetes. RESULTS: A slightly elevated risk [Mantel-Haenszel odds 
      ratio (MH-OR) 1.2, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.82-1.8] was found for 
      diabetes mellitus among the glassworks employees, especially in combination with 
      cardiovascular disease (MH-OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.81-2.3). For the glassblowers, other 
      foundry workers and unspecified glassworkers probably exposed to arsenic, the M-H 
      odds ratio was 1.4 (95% CI 0.92-2.2). Unspecified glass workers, who probably 
      included persons with high exposure, carried the higher risk (MH-OR 1.8, 95% CI 
      1.1-2.8). CONCLUSIONS: The observations from this study provide limited support 
      for the possibility that occupational arsenic exposure could play a role in the 
      development of diabetes mellitus. Many other metallic compounds are also used in 
      art glass production, however, and there is a possibility of confounding.
