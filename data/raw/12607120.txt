TI  - Does anastomotic leakage affect functional outcome after rectal resection for 
      cancer?
PG  - 406-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leakage is the most threatening early complication in 
      sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery. While the oncological consequences 
      have been well examined, only few data exist about the functional outcome. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated continence function in 150 patients after 
      curative sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery. Functional results were 
      compared in 22 patients with a clinically relevant anastomotic leakage, confirmed 
      radiologically or endoscopically, and 128 patients with uneventful recovery. 
      Evaluation of continence function was based on the Cleveland Clinic Continence 
      Score and was examined in all patients with anastomotic leakage and in 111 
      patients without complications 107+/-46 weeks postoperatively. Additionally, 14 
      patients with anastomotic leakage and 58 patients with uneventful recovery 
      underwent anorectal manometry 26+/-15 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: The 
      continence score in patients after anastomotic leakage did not differ 
      significantly from that in patients without complications. Sphincter function was 
      similar. Maximum tolerable volume and rectal compliance were slightly but not 
      significantly worse after leakage. CONCLUSIONS: Continence function remained 
      undisturbed after anastomotic leakage due to rectal resection
