TI  - Does the aggressive use of polyvalent antivenin for rattlesnake bites result in 
      serious acute side effects?
PG  - 88-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and severity of acute side effects from the 
      use of polyvalent antivenin in victims of rattlesnake bites. DESIGN: We 
      retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who presented with 
      rattlesnake bites to a university teaching hospital during an 11-year period. 
      From patient medical records, we extracted demographic data, clinical 
      measurements, and outcomes during emergency department evaluation and subsequent 
      hospitalization. Data regarding serum sickness were not collected. OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Primary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate 
      hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent 
      disability at hospital discharge, and mortality. RESULTS: We identified a total 
      of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation 
      was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); 
      moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 
      patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per 
      patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 
      or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin 
      given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 
      (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3). No deaths, amputations, or permanent 
      disability from snakebite occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. Acute 
      side effects of antivenin-occurring within the first 6 hours after 
      administration-were seen in 12 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-30%). 
      Acute side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but 1 patient (2%; 95% 
      confidence interval, 0%-8%). This patient had a history of previous antivenin 
      reaction and required a short course of intravenous epinephrine for blood 
      pressure support. No other complications occurred. CONCLUSION: The administration 
      of polyvalent Crotalidae antivenin is safe. Acute hypersensitivity, when it 
      occurs, consists solely in most cases of urticaria. Serious side effects are 
      uncommon.
