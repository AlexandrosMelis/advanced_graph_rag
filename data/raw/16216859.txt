TI  - Does a well developed collateral circulation predispose to restenosis after 
      percutaneous coronary intervention? An intravascular ultrasound study.
PG  - 763-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a well developed collateral circulation 
      predisposes to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). DESIGN: 
      Prospective observational study. PATIENTS AND SETTING: 58 patients undergoing 
      elective single vessel PCI in a tertiary referral interventional cardiac unit in 
      the UK. METHODS: Collateral flow index (CFI) was calculated as (Pw-Pv)/(Pa-Pv), 
      where Pa, Pw, and Pv are aortic, coronary wedge, and right atrial pressures 
      during maximum hyperaemia. Collateral supply was considered poor (CFI < 0.25) or 
      good (CFI > or = 0.25). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-stent restenosis six months 
      after PCI, classified as neointimal volume > or = 25% stent volume on 
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), or minimum lumen area < or = 50% stent area on 
      IVUS, or minimum lumen diameter < or = 50% reference vessel diameter on 
      quantitative coronary angiography. RESULTS: Patients with good collaterals had 
      more severe coronary stenoses at baseline (90 (11)% v 75 (16)%, p < 0.001). 
      Restenosis rates were similar in poor and good collateral groups (35% v 43%, p = 
      0.76 for diameter restenosis, 27% v 45%, p = 0.34 for area restenosis, and 23% v 
      24%, p = 0.84 for volumetric restenosis). CFI was not correlated with diameter, 
      area, or volumetric restenosis (r2 < 0.1 for each). By multivariate analysis, 
      stent diameter, stent length, > 10% residual stenosis, and smoking history were 
      predictive of restenosis. CONCLUSION: A well developed collateral circulation 
      does not predict an increased risk of restenosis after PCI.
