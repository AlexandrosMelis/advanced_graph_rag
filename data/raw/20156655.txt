      become our first choice?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the advantages of scrotal incision in the treatment of 
      undescended testis. Undescended testis is a common pediatric condition and is 
      conventionally managed surgically by orchidopexy. A single scrotal incision 
      orchidopexy has become accepted as a valid approach for patients with palpable 
      undescended testicles. Because this approach also allows easy detection of 
      atrophic testes or testicular remnants, it recently has also emerged as an 
      alternative initial surgical approach to impalpable undescended testicles. 
      METHODS: All orchidopexies performed between 2004 and 2008 at our university 
      hospital were prospectively included in this study. A total of 194 scrotal 
      orchidopexies were performed in 154 patients (mean age, 71 months; range, 4-229 
      months). In all cases a scrotal approach was chosen irrespective of the initial 
      position or presence of an open processus vaginalis. Testicular position was 
      examined at follow-up after a mean period of 10 months (3-22 months). RESULTS: 
      Overall, 36 of the 46 impalpable testicles (78%) could be diagnosed and treated 
      accordingly, using only a scrotal incision. Conversion to laparoscopy was needed 
      in 4 cases. A limited number of postoperative complications were seen. In all 
      cases, the testes were palpable and remained in the scrotum on follow-up. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Initial single scrotal incision can be recommended for orchidopexy, 
      even in the more difficult cases of impalpable undescended testes. Advantages 
      seem to include shorter operative time, a cosmetically appealing single incision, 
      and possibly less pain. The scrotal incision technique significantly reduces the 
      need for laparoscopy in impalpable testes. Surprisingly, it even allows 
      successful orchidopexy of abdominal testes, provided an open processus is 
      present.
