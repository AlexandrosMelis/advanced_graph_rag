      trauma severity?

AB  - PURPOSE: Traumatic aortic injury (TAI) is a rare but life-threatening type of 
      injury. We investigate whether the anatomy of the aortic arch influences the 
      severity of aortic injury. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of twenty-two 
      cases treated with TEVAR for TAI in our department from 2009 to 2014. Aortic 
      injury was assessed in accordance with the recommendations of the Society of 
      Vascular Surgery. We measured the aortic arch angle and the aortic arch index, 
      based on the initial angio-CT scan, in each of the analyzed cases. RESULTS: The 
      mean aortic arch index and mean aortic arch angle were 6.8 cm and 58.3 degrees , 
      respectively, in the type I injury group; 4.4 cm and 45.9 degrees  in the type III group; 
      3.3 cm and 37 degrees  in the type IV group. There were substantial differences in both 
      the aortic arch index and the aortic arch angle of the type III and IV groups. A 
      multivariate analysis confirmed that the aortic arch angle was significantly 
      associated with the occurrence of type III damage (OR 1.5; 95% CI 1.03-2.2). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The severity of TAI is influenced by the sharpness of the aortic 
      arch. There is an inverse relationship between the severity of aortic injury and 
      the aortic arch index.
