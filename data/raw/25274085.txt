AB  - BACKGROUND: Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at different loci have 
      been associated with breast cancer susceptibility, accounting for around 10% of 
      the familial component. Recent studies have found direct associations between 
      specific SNPs and breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Our aim was to 
      determine whether validated susceptibility SNP scores improve the predictive 
      ability of risk models in comparison/conjunction to other clinical/demographic 
      information. METHODS: Female BRCA1/2 carriers were identified from the Manchester 
      genetic database, and included in the study regardless of breast cancer status or 
      age. DNA was extracted from blood samples provided by these women and used for 
      gene and SNP profiling. Estimates of survival were examined with Kaplan-Meier 
      curves. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were fit in the separate 
      BRCA datasets and in menopausal stages screening different combinations of 
      clinical/demographic/genetic variables. Nonlinear random survival forests were 
      also fit to identify relevant interactions. Models were compared using Harrell's 
      concordance index (1 - c-index). RESULTS: 548 female BRCA1 mutation carriers and 
      523 BRCA2 carriers were identified from the database. Median Kaplan-Meier 
      estimate of survival was 46.0 years (44.9-48.1) for BRCA1 carriers and 48.9 
      (47.3-50.4) for BRCA2. By fitting Cox models and random survival forests, 
      including both a genetic SNP score and clinical/demographic variables, average 1 
      - c-index values were 0.221 (st.dev. 0.019) for BRCA1 carriers and 0.215 (st.dev. 
      0.018) for BRCA2 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: Random survival forests did not yield 
      higher performance compared to Cox proportional hazards. We found improvement in 
      prediction performance when coupling the genetic SNP score with 
      clinical/demographic markers, which warrants further investigation.
