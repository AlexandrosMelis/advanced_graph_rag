AB  - INTRODUCTION: Halofantrine is a newly developed antimalarial drug used for the 
      treatment of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The introduction of this drug has 
      been delayed because of its possible side effects, and due to insufficient 
      studies on adverse reactions in humans. There have been no studies investigating 
      its effect on hearing. METHODS: Thirty guinea pigs were divided into three 
      groups: a control group, a halofantrine therapeutic dose group and a halofantrine 
      double therapeutic dose group. One cochlea specimen from each animal was stained 
      with haematoxylin and eosin and the other with toluidine blue. RESULTS: No 
      changes were detected in the control group. The halofantrine therapeutic dose 
      group showed loss and distortion of inner hair cells and inner phalangeal cells, 
      and loss of spiral ganglia cells. In the halofantrine double therapeutic dose 
      group, the inner and outer hair cells were distorted and there was loss of spiral 
      ganglia cells. CONCLUSION: Halofantrine has mild to moderate pathological effects 
      on cochlea histology, and can be considered an ototoxic drug.
