TI  - Can calprotectin predict relapse risk in inflammatory bowel disease?
PG  - 2007-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessing the clinical course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) 
      patients consists of periodical clinical evaluations and laboratory tests. We 
      aimed to assess the role of calprotectin tests in predicting clinical relapse in 
      IBD patients. METHODS: Ninety-seven patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 65 
      with Crohn's disease (CD) in clinical remission were prospectively included in 
      the study. A 10-g stool sample was collected for calprotectin assay. The cutoff 
      level was set at 130 mg/kg of feces. Patients were followed up for 1 yr after the 
      test or until relapse. The cumulative proportion of relapses was estimated by the 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis. Statistics for equality of survival distribution were 
      tested using the log-rank test. RESULTS: The calprotectin test was positive in 44 
      UC patients and 26 of them relapsed within a year, while 11 of 53 UC patients 
      with a negative calprotectin test relapsed within the same time frame. Thirty CD 
      patients had a positive calprotectin test and 13 of them relapsed within a year, 
      as did 7 of the 35 with a negative test result. A significant correlation emerged 
      between a positive calprotectin test and the probability of relapse in UC 
      patients (P= 0.000). In CD patients, only cases of colonic CD showed a 
      significant correlation between a positive calprotectin test and the probability 
      of relapse, i.e., 6 colonic CD patients were positive for the calprotectin test 
      and 4 relapsed (P= 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Measuring calprotectin may help to 
      identify UC and colonic CD patients at higher risk of clinical relapse.
