TI  - Are environmental factors important in primary systemic vasculitis? A 
      case-control study.
PG  - 814-23
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between primary systemic vasculitis 
      (PSV) and environmental risk factors. METHODS: Seventy-five PSV cases and 273 
      controls (220 nonvasculitis, 19 secondary vasculitis, and 34 asthma controls) 
      were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Factors investigated were 
      social class, occupational and residential history, smoking, pets, allergies, 
      vaccinations, medications, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and farm exposure in the year 
      before symptom onset (index year). The Standard Occupational Classification 2000 
      and job-exposure matrices were used to assess occupational silica, solvent, and 
      metal exposure. Stepwise multiple logistic regression was used to calculate the 
      odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for potential 
      confounders. Total PSV, subgroups (47 Wegener's granulomatosis [WG], 12 
      microscopic polyangiitis, 16 Churg-Strauss syndrome [CSS]), and antineutrophil 
      cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive cases were compared with control groups. 
      RESULTS: Farming in the index year was significantly associated with PSV (OR 2.3 
      [95% CI 1.2-4.6]), with WG (2.7 [1.2-5.8]), with MPA (6.3 [1.9-21.6]), and with 
      perinuclear ANCA (pANCA) (4.3 [1.5-12.7]). Farming during working lifetime was 
      associated with PSV (2.2 [1.2-3.8]) and with WG (2.7 [1.3-5.7]). Significant 
      associations were found for high occupational silica exposure in the index year 
      (with PSV 3.0 [1.0-8.4], with CSS 5.6 [1.3-23.5], and with ANCA 4.9 [1.3-18.6]), 
      high occupational solvent exposure in the index year (with PSV 3.4 [0.9-12.5], 
      with WG 4.8 [1.2-19.8], and with classic ANCA [cANCA] 3.9 [1.6-9.5]), high 
      occupational solvent exposure during working lifetime (with PSV 2.7 [1.1-6.6], 
      with WG 3.4 [1.3-8.9], and with cANCA 3.3 [1.0-10.8]), drug allergy (with PSV 3.6 
      [1.8-7.0], with WG 4.0 [1.8-8.7], and with cANCA 4.7 [1.9-11.7]), and allergy 
      overall (with PSV 2.2 [1.2-3.9], with WG 2.7 [1.4-5.7]). No other significant 
      associations were found. CONCLUSION: A significant association between farming 
      and PSV has been identified for the first time. Results also support previously 
      reported associations with silica, solvents, and allergy.
