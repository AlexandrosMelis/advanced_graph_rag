AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between fetal biometry in the first or 
      early second trimester and severe macrosomia at delivery. METHODS: This 
      case-control study included 30 term severely macrosomic neonates; 90 
      appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates served as controls. All 
      pregnancies underwent nuchal translucency (NT) screening at 11-14 weeks' 
      gestation. Pregnancies were dated by accurate last menstrual period consistent 
      with crown-rump length (CRL) measurements at the time of screening, early 
      pregnancy CRL or date of fertilization. The association between birth weight and 
      the difference between the measured and the expected CRL at the time of NT 
      screening was analyzed. RESULTS: The difference between measured and expected 
      CRL, expressed both in mm and in days of gestation, was statistically greater in 
      the severely macrosomic neonates compared with controls (mean, 6.66 +/- 4.78 mm 
      vs. 1.17 +/- 4.6 mm, P < 0.0001 and 3 +/- 2.2 days vs. 0.5 +/- 2.3 days, P < 
      0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, there were significant correlations between 
      the extent of macrosomia and the discrepancy between expected and measured fetal 
      size at the time of NT screening (r = 0.47, P < 0.01 and r = 0.48, P < 0.01, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Severe macrosomia apparently manifests as early as 
      11-14 weeks' gestation.
