AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of a balloon expandable stent valve includes balloon 
      predilatation of the aortic stenosis before valve deployment. The aim of the 
      study was to see whether or not balloon predilatation is necessary in 
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI). METHODS: Sixty consecutive TAVI 
      patients were randomized to the standard procedure or to a protocol where balloon 
      predilatation was omitted. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between 
      the groups regarding early hemodynamic results or complication rates. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TAVI can be performed safely without balloon predilatation and with 
      the same early results as achieved with the standard procedure including balloon 
      predilatation. The reduction in the number of pacing periods required may be 
      beneficial for the patient.
