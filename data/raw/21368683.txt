TI  - Are patients with serious mental illness more likely to be admitted to nursing 
      homes with more deficiencies in care?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with serious mental illness (SMI) who qualify for 
      nursing home placement tend to require high levels of both psychiatric and 
      nursing care. However, it is unknown whether they are equally likely to be 
      admitted to nursing homes with adequate quality of care compared with other 
      patients. METHODS: We analyzed a national cohort of more than 1.3 million new 
      nursing home admissions in 2007 using the minimum data set. The total and 
      healthcare-related deficiency citations for each facility were obtained from the 
      Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting file. Bivariate and multivariate 
      regression analyses determined the association of schizophrenia or bipolar 
      disorder with admissions to facilities with higher deficiencies. RESULTS: 
      Compared with other patients, patients with schizophrenia (n=23,767) tended to 
      enter nursing homes with more total (13.3 vs. 11.2, P<0.001) and 
      healthcare-related deficiencies (8.6 vs. 7.2, P<0.001); and patients with bipolar 
      disorder (n=19,741) were more likely to enter facilities with more problematic 
      care too (12.5 vs. 11.2, P<0.001 for total deficiencies; and 8.2 vs. 7.2, P<0.001 
      for healthcare-related deficiencies). After sequentially controlling for the 
      within-county choice of facilities, patient characteristics, and facility 
      covariates, the association of SMI with admitting to higher-deficiency nursing 
      homes persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar 
      disorder (ie, SMI) were more likely than other patients to be admitted to nursing 
      homes with higher deficiency citations for both overall quality and clinical care 
      quality. Further research is necessary to understand the reasons behind the 
      disparity in quality of nursing home care associated with SMI.
