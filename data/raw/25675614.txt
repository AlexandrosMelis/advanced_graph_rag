TI  - Can gingival crevicular blood be relied upon for assessment of blood glucose 
      level?
PG  - 38-42
AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is undiagnosed in approximately half of the patients 
      actually suffering from the disease. In addition, the prevalence of DM is more 
      than twice as high as in patients with periodontitis when compared to 
      periodontally healthy subjects. Thus, a high number of patients with 
      periodontitis may have undiagnosed DM. The purpose of the present study was to 
      evaluate whether blood oozing from a gingival crevice during routine periodontal 
      examination can be used for determining glucose levels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Observational cross-sectional studies were carried out in 75 patients (43 males 
      and 32 females) with chronic periodontitis who were divided into two groups: 
      Group I and Group II, respectively. Blood oozing from the gingival crevices of 
      anterior teeth following periodontal probing was collected with the stick of 
      glucose self-monitoring device, and the blood glucose levels were measured. At 
      the same time, finger-prick blood was taken for glucometric analysis and 
      subsequent readings were recorded. RESULTS: The patient's blood glucose values 
      ranged from 74 to 256 mg/dl. The comparison between gingival crevicular blood and 
      finger-prick blood showed a very strong correlation, with a t value of 3.97 (at P 
      value = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The data from this study has shown that GCB 
      collected during diagnostic periodontal examination can be an excellent source of 
      blood for glucometric analysis.
