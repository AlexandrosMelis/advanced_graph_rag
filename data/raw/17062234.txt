TI  - Surgical management of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta: is endoaortic balloon 
      occlusion safe?
PG  - 1709-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Occlusion of the atherosclerotic ascending aorta by an endoaortic 
      inflatable balloon has been proposed as an alternative to conventional 
      cross-clamping to prevent injury to the vessel and distal embolization of debris. 
      The safety and the effectiveness of endoaortic occlusion have not been documented 
      in this setting. METHODS: Endoaortic occlusion was employed in 52 of 2,172 
      consecutive patients. Surgeon's choice was based on preoperative identification 
      of aortic calcifications or intraoperative epiaortic ultrasonographic scanning. 
      Deaths and strokes were analyzed casewise and in aggregate. RESULTS: In 10 
      patients (19.2%), the endoaortic balloon had to be replaced by the ordinary 
      cross-clamp because of incomplete occlusion (n = 5), hindered exposure (n = 2), 
      or balloon rupture (n = 3). In-hospital death occurred in 13 patients (25%), and 
      stroke on awakening from anesthesia in 2 (3.8%). The death rate of patients 
      treated by endoaortic occlusion was significantly higher compared with all other 
      patients (4.2%, p < 0.0001) and with the expected estimate by European System for 
      Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (10.5%, p = 0.05). By multivariable analysis, 
      use of endoaortic occlusion was independently associated with in-hospital death 
      (odds ratio = 5.609, 95% confidence interval: 2.684 to 11.719). Although the 
      stroke rate was higher in the endoaortic occlusion group compared with all other 
      patients, the difference was only possibly significant (3.8% versus 0.8%, p = 
      0.067). CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the endoaortic occlusion was frequently 
      ineffective, and was associated with a significantly higher risk of in-hospital 
      death and a numerically higher risk of stroke.
