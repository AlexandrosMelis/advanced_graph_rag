TI  - Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement?
PG  - 332-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unicompartmental replacement can be an alternative to tibial 
      osteotomy in younger, active patients with unicompartmental knee disease. In 
      unicompartmental replacement, the other compartments and knee ligaments are 
      largely untouched. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the knee kinematics after 
      unicompartmental replacement may also be unchanged. To test this hypothesis, knee 
      kinematics and quadriceps tension were recorded before and after replacement with 
      a unicompartmental design and then with a tricompartmental design. METHODS: Six 
      human cadaver knees were tested before implantation, after implantation with a 
      bicruciate-retaining unicompartmental knee prosthesis, and after implantation 
      with a posterior cruciate-retaining tricompartmental knee prosthesis. The 
      unicompartmental prosthesis was initially implanted, and it was then revised to a 
      total condylar knee replacement. The knee kinematics were measured with use of an 
      electromagnetic tracking device while the knee was put through dynamic simulated 
      stair-climbing under peak flexion moments of approximately 40 N-m. Quadriceps 
      tension was also measured for all three conditions. RESULTS: No significant 
      differences in tibial axial rotation were noted between the intact and 
      unicompartmental conditions. However, tricompartmental replacement significantly 
      affected tibial axial rotation (p = 0.001). Femoral rollback was not 
      significantly affected by either unicompartmental or tricompartmental 
      arthroplasty. Quadriceps tension was also similar among all three conditions. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this in vitro cadaver study, the tricompartmental replacement 
      significantly changed knee kinematics while the unicompartmental replacement 
      preserved normal knee kinematics.
