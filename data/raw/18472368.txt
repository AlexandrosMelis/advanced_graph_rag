TI  - Does treatment duration affect outcome after radiotherapy for prostate cancer?

AB  - PURPOSE: The protraction of external beam radiotherapy (RT) time is detrimental 
      in several disease sites. In prostate cancer, the overall treatment time can be 
      considerable, as can the potential for treatment breaks. We evaluated the effect 
      of elapsed treatment time on outcome after RT for prostate cancer. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Between April 1989 and November 2004, 1,796 men with prostate cancer 
      were treated with RT alone. The nontreatment day ratio (NTDR) was defined as the 
      number of nontreatment days divided by the total elapsed days of RT. This ratio 
      was used to account for the relationship between treatment duration and total RT 
      dose. Men were stratified into low risk (n = 789), intermediate risk (n = 798), 
      and high risk (n = 209) using a single-factor model. RESULTS: The 10-year freedom 
      from biochemical failure (FFBF) rate was 68% for a NTDR <33% vs. 58% for NTDR 
      >/=33% (p = 0.02; BF was defined as a prostate-specific antigen nadir + 2 ng/mL). 
      In the low-risk group, the 10-year FFBF rate was 82% for NTDR <33% vs. 57% for 
      NTDR >/=33% (p = 0.0019). The NTDR was independently predictive for FFBF (p = 
      0.03), in addition to T stage (p = 0.005) and initial prostate-specific antigen 
      level (p < 0.0001) on multivariate analysis, including Gleason score and 
      radiation dose. The NTDR was not a significant predictor of FFBF when examined in 
      the intermediate-risk group, high-risk group, or all risk groups combined. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A proportionally longer treatment duration was identified as an 
      adverse factor in low-risk patients. Treatment breaks resulting in a NTDR of 
      >/=33% (e.g., four or more breaks during a 40-fraction treatment, 5 d/wk) should 
      be avoided.
