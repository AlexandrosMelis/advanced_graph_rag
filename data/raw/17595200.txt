TI  - Is there an intrauterine influence on obesity? Evidence from parent child 
      associations in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC).
PG  - 876-80
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that increasing obesity levels in young women 
      lead to intrauterine environments that, in turn, stimulate increased obesity 
      among their offspring, generating an intergenerational acceleration of obesity 
      levels. If this mechanism is important, the association of maternal body mass 
      index (BMI) with offspring BMI should be stronger than the association of 
      paternal with offspring BMI. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative strengths of 
      association of maternal and paternal BMI with offspring BMI at age 7.5, taking 
      into account the possible effect of non-paternity. METHODS: We compared strength 
      of association for maternal-offspring and paternal-offspring BMI for 4654 
      complete parent-offspring trios in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and 
      Children (ALSPAC), using unstandardised and standardised regression analysis. We 
      carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the influence of non-paternity 
      on these associations. RESULTS: The strength of association between parental BMI 
      and offspring BMI at age 7.5 was similar for both parents. Taking into account 
      correlations between maternal and paternal BMI, performing standardised rather 
      than unstandardised regression and carrying out a sensitivity analysis for 
      non-paternity emphasised the robustness of the general similarity of the 
      associations. The associations between high parental BMI (top decile) and 
      offspring BMI are also similar for both parents. CONCLUSION: Comparison of 
      mother-offspring and father-offspring associations for BMI suggests that 
      intergenerational acceleration mechanisms do not make an important contribution 
      to levels of childhood BMI within the population. Associations at later ages and 
      for different components of body composition now require study.
