TI  - Does normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion 
      improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts?
PG  - 1751-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Beating-heart valve surgery appears to be a promising technique for 
      protection of hypertrophied hearts. Normothermic normokalemic simultaneous 
      antegrade/retrograde perfusion (NNSP) may improve myocardial perfusion. However, 
      its effects on myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism remain unclear. The 
      present study was to determine whether NNSP improved myocardial oxygenation and 
      energy metabolism of hypertrophied hearts relative to normothermic normokalemic 
      antegrade perfusion (NNAP). METHODS: Twelve hypertrophied pig hearts underwent a 
      protocol consisting of three 20-minute perfusion episodes (10 minutes NNAP and 10 
      minutes NNSP in a random order) with each conducted at a different blood flow in 
      the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD [100%, 50%, and 20% of its 
      initial control]). Myocardial oxygenation was assessed using near-infrared 
      spectroscopic imaging. Myocardial energy metabolism was monitored using localized 
      phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. RESULTS: With 100% LAD flow, both 
      NNAP and NNSP maintained myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, 
      phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate at normal levels. When LAD flow was 
      reduced to 50% of its control level, NNSP resulted in a small but significant 
      decrease in myocardial oxygenation and phosphocreatine, whereas those 
      measurements did not change significantly during NNAP. With LAD flow further 
      reduced to 20% of its control level, both NNAP and NNSP caused a substantial 
      decrease in myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, and phosphocreatine 
      with an increase in inorganic phosphate. However, the changes were significantly 
      greater during NNSP than during NNAP. CONCLUSIONS: Normothermic normokalemic 
      simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion did not improve, but slightly 
      impaired myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism of beating hypertrophied 
      hearts relative to NNAP. Therefore, NNSP for protection of beating hypertrophied 
      hearts during valve surgery should be used with extra caution.
