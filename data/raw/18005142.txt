TI  - Does early migraine treatment shorten time to headache peak and reduce its 
      severity?
PG  - 914-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore whether early treatment would shorten the duration of 
      headache from headache onset to its peak and reduce headache severity at peak. 
      BACKGROUND: Prior clinical studies almost exclusively focused on headache relief 
      after dosing. No data are available on whether early intervention affects the 
      duration from headache onset to peak and headache severity at peak. METHODS: 
      Adult migraineurs were enrolled in this observational study from multi-site 
      headache clinics. Patients recorded their migraine experiences via an electronic 
      diary over 1 month. Patients reported the time and pain severity at onset, 
      dosing, and peak. We used a linear mixed model to evaluate the impact of the 
      timing of treatment and to adjust for covariates and correlation of observations 
      within subjects. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients reported 970 migraine episodes, 
      620 of which were treated before headaches progressed to peak. Mean time from 
      headache onset to peak varied from 1.9 hours to 8.9 hours for patients treated 
      within 15 minutes of onset and those who waited for 4 or more hours, 
      respectively. However, early intervention was not associated with reduced 
      headache severity at peak. In multivariate analysis, early treatment, use of 
      triptans, and mild migraine headache in the past 3 months were significantly 
      associated with shorter time from onset to headache peak. A separate model 
      indicated that the timing of medication was not associated with the duration 
      between dosing and headache peak, but use of triptans shortened the time from 
      dosing to headache peak. CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment and use of triptans may 
      lead to shorter duration from migraine headache onset to its peak but did not 
      alleviate headache severity at peak. This could result in decreased migraine 
      burden by reducing total migraine headache duration.
