TI  - Do preoperative statins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass 
      grafting?
PG  - 376-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that statins have pleiotropic 
      effects, including anti-inflammatory effects and atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      preventive effects. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of 
      preoperative statin therapy in preventing AF after coronary artery bypass 
      grafting (CABG). METHODS: 221 patients underwent CABG in our hospital from 2004 
      to 2007. 14 patients with preoperative AF and 4 patients with concomitant valve 
      surgery were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into two groups to 
      examine the influence of statins: those with preoperative statin therapy (Statin 
      group, n = 77) and those without it (Non-statin group, n = 126). In addition, 
      patients were divided into two groups to determine the independent predictors for 
      postoperative AF: those with postoperative AF (AF group, n = 54) and those 
      without it (Non-AF group, n = 149). Patient data were collected and analyzed 
      retrospectively. RESULTS: The overall incidence of postoperative AF was 26%. 
      Postoperative AF was significantly lower in the Statin group compared with the 
      Non-statin group (16% versus 33%, p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis demonstrated 
      that independent predictors of AF development after CABG were preoperative statin 
      therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.327, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.107 to 0.998, p = 
      0.05) and age (OR 1.058, 95% CI 1.004 to 1.116, p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our study 
      indicated that preoperative statin therapy seems to reduce AF development after 
      CABG.
