AB  - BACKGROUND: An increasingly significant public health issue in Canada, and 
      elsewhere throughout the developed world, pertains to the provision of adequate 
      palliative/end-of-life (P/EOL) care. Informal caregivers who take on the 
      responsibility of providing P/EOL care often experience negative physical, 
      mental, emotional, social and economic consequences. In this article, we 
      specifically examine how Canada's Compassionate Care Benefit (CCB)--a 
      contributory benefits social program aimed at informal P/EOL caregivers--operates 
      as a public health response in sustaining informal caregivers providing P/EOL 
      care, and whether or not it adequately addresses known aspects of caregiver 
      burden that are addressed within the population health promotion (PHP) model. 
      METHODS: As part of a national evaluation of Canada's Compassionate Care Benefit, 
      57 telephone interviews were conducted with Canadian informal P/EOL caregivers in 
      5 different provinces, pertaining to the strengths and weaknesses of the CCB and 
      the general caregiving experience. Interview data was coded with Nvivo software 
      and emerging themes were identified by the research team, with such findings 
      published elsewhere. The purpose of the present analysis was identified after 
      comparing the findings to the literature specific to caregiver burden and public 
      health, after which data was analyzed using the PHP model as a guiding framework. 
      RESULTS: Informal caregivers spoke to several of the determinants of health 
      outlined in the PHP model that are implicated in their burden experience: gender, 
      income and social status, working conditions, health and social services, social 
      support network, and personal health practises and coping strategies. They 
      recognized the need for improving the CCB to better address these determinants. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study, from the perspective of family caregivers, demonstrates 
      that the CCB is not living up to its full potential in sustaining informal P/EOL 
      caregivers. Effort is required to transform the CCB so that it may fulfill the 
      potential it holds for serving as one public health response to caregiver burden 
      that forms part of a healthy public policy that addresses the determinants of 
      this burden.
