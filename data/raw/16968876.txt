TI  - Is a patient's self-reported health-related quality of life a prognostic factor 
      for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients? A multivariate analysis of 
      prognostic factors of EORTC study 08975.
PG  - 1698-704
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this prognostic factor analysis was to investigate if a 
      patient's self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) provided 
      independent prognostic information for survival in non-small cell lung cancer 
      (NSCLC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment HRQOL was measured in 391 
      advanced NSCLC patients using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC Lung Cancer module 
      (QLQ-LC13). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for both 
      univariate and multivariate analyses of survival. In addition, a bootstrap 
      validation technique was used to assess the stability of the outcomes. RESULTS: 
      The final multivariate Cox regression model retained four parameters as 
      independent prognostic factors for survival: male gender with a hazard ratio (HR) 
      = 1.32 (95% CI 1.03-1.69; P = 0.03); performance status (0 to 1 versus 2) with HR 
      = 1.63 (95% CI 1.04-2.54; P = 0.032); patient's self-reported score of pain with 
      HR= 1.11 (95% CI 1.07-1.16; P < 0.001) and dysphagia with HR = 1.12 (95% CI 
      1.04-1.21; P = 0.003). A 10-point shift worse in the scale measuring pain and 
      dysphagia translated into an 11% and 12% increased in the likelihood of death 
      respectively. A risk group categorization was also developed. CONCLUSION: The 
      results suggest that patients' self-reported HRQOL provide independent prognostic 
      information for survival. This finding supports the collection of such data in 
      routine clinical practice.
