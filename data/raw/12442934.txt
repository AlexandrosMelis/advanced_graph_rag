TI  - Does ibuprofen increase perioperative blood loss during hip arthroplasty?
PG  - 829-31
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prior exposure of non-steroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs increases perioperative blood loss associated with major 
      orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: Fifty patients scheduled for total hip replacement 
      were allocated to two groups (double blind, randomized manner). All patients were 
      pretreated for 2 weeks before surgery: Group 1 with placebo drug, Group 2 with 
      ibuprofen. All patients were injected intrathecally with bupivacaine 20mg plus 
      morphine 0.1 mg, in a total volume of 4 mL, to provide surgical anaesthesia. 
      RESULTS: The presence of severe adverse effects caused eight patients in the 
      ibuprofen group and six in the placebo group to terminate their participation in 
      the trial. The perioperative blood loss increased by 45% in the ibuprofen group 
      compared with placebo. The total (+/-SD) blood loss in the ibuprofen group was 
      1161 (+/-472) mL versus 796 (+/-337) mL in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pretreatment with ibuprofen before elective total hip surgery increases the 
      perioperative blood loss significantly. Early discontinuation of non-selective 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is advised.
