      knee replacement?

AB  - PURPOSE: There are a number of factors responsible for the longevity of 
      unicompartmental knee replacements (UKR). These include the magnitude of 
      postoperative alignment and the type of material used. The effect of component 
      design and material on postoperative alignment, however, has not been explored. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients who underwent UKR 
      with robotic guidance. Patients were divided into two groups, according to 
      whether they had received an all-polyethylene inlay component (Inlay group) or a 
      metal-backed onlay component (Onlay group). We explored the magnitude of 
      mechanical alignment correction obtained in both groups. RESULTS: Mean 
      postoperative mechanical alignment was significantly closer to neutral in the 
      Onlay group (mean=2.8 degrees ; 95% CI=2.4 degrees , 3.2 degrees ) compared to the Inlay group 
      (mean=3.9 degrees ; 95% CI=3.4 degrees , 4.4 degrees ) (R2=0.65; P=0.003), adjusting for gender, BMI, 
      age, side and preoperative mechanical alignment (Fig. 2). Further exploration 
      revealed that the thickness of the tibial polyethyelene insert had a significant 
      effect on postoperative alignment when added to the model (R2=0.68; P=0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: Patients who received a metal-backed Onlay tibial component obtained 
      better postoperative mechanical alignment compared to those who received 
      all-polyethylene Inlay prostheses. The thicker overall construct of Onlay 
      prostheses appears to be an important determinant of postoperative alignment. 
      Considering their higher survivorship rates and improved postoperative mechanical 
      alignment, Onlay prostheses should be the first option when performing medial 
      UKR.
