AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the effect of student examiners (SE) to that of faculty 
      examiners (FE) on examinee performance in an OSCE as well as on post-assessment 
      evaluation in the area of emergency medicine management. METHODS: An OSCE 
      test-format (seven stations: Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Basic Life 
      Support (BLS), Trauma-Management (TM), Pediatric-Emergencies (PE), 
      Acute-Coronary-Syndrome (ACS), Airway-Management (AM), and 
      Obstetrical-Emergencies (OE)) was administered to 207 medical students in their 
      third year of training after they had received didactics in emergency medicine 
      management. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two simultaneously 
      run tracks: either with SE (n = 110) or with FE (n = 98). Students were asked to 
      rate each OSCE station and to provide their overall OSCE perception by means of a 
      standardized questionnaire. The independent samples t-test was used and effect 
      sizes were calculated (Cohens d). RESULTS: Students achieved significantly higher 
      scores for the OSCE stations "TM", "AM", and "OE" as well as "overall OSCE score" 
      in the SE track, whereas the station score for "PE" was significantly higher for 
      students in the FE track. Mostly small effect sizes were reported. In the 
      post-assessment evaluation portion of the study, students gave significant higher 
      ratings for the ACS station and "overall OSCE evaluation" in the FE track; also 
      with small effect sizes. CONCLUSION: It seems quite admissible and justified to 
      encourage medical students to officiate as examiners in undergraduate emergency 
      medicine OSCE formative testing, but not necessarily in summative assessment 
      evaluations.
