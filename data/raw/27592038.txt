AB  - BACKGROUND: Tinnitus can be related to many different aetiologies such as hearing 
      loss or a noise trauma, but it can also be related to the somatosensory system of 
      the cervical spine, called cervicogenic somatic tinnitus (CST). Case studies 
      suggest a positive effect of cervical spine treatment on tinnitus complaints in 
      patients with CST, but no experimental studies are available. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate the effect of a multimodal cervical physical therapy treatment on 
      tinnitus complaints in patients with CST. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. 
      PATIENTS: Patients with a combination of severe subjective tinnitus (Tinnitus 
      Functional Index (TFI): 25-90 points) and neck complaints (Neck Bournemouth 
      Questionnaire (NBQ) > 14 points). INTERVENTION: All patients received cervical 
      physical therapy for 6 weeks (12 sessions). Patients were randomized in an 
      immediate-start therapy group (n = 19) and a 6-week delayed-start therapy group 
      (n = 19). MEASUREMENTS: TFI and NBQ-scores were documented at baseline, after the 
      wait-and-see period in the delayed-start group, after treatment and after 6 weeks 
      follow-up. The Global Perceived Effect (GPE) was documented at all measuring 
      moments, except at baseline. RESULTS: In all patients (n = 38) TFI and NBQ-scores 
      decreased significantly after treatment (p = 0.04 and p < 0.001). NBQ-scores 
      remained significantly lower after follow-up (p = 0.001). Immediately after 
      treatment, 53% (n = 38) experienced substantial improvement of tinnitus. This 
      effect was maintained in 24% of patients after follow-up at six weeks. 
      CONCLUSION: Cervical physical therapy can have a positive effect on subjective 
      tinnitus complaints in patients with a combination of tinnitus and neck 
      complaints. Larger studies, using more responsive outcome measures, are however 
      necessary to prove this effect. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02016313.
