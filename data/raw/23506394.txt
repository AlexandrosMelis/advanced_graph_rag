AB  - BACKGROUND: Arterial calcification is a significant cardiovascular risk factor in 
      hemodialysis patients. A series of factors are involved in the process of 
      arterial calcification; however, the relationship between malnutrition and 
      arterial calcification is still unclear. METHODS: 68 hemodialysis patients were 
      enrolled in this study. Nutrition status was evaluated using modified 
      quantitative subjective global assessment (MQSGA). Related serum biochemical 
      parameters were measured. And the radial artery samples were collected during the 
      arteriovenous fistula surgeries. Hematoxylin/eosin stain was used to observe the 
      arterial structures while Alizarin red stain to observe calcified depositions and 
      classify calcified degree. The expressions of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) 
      and matrix Gla protein (MGP) were detected by immunohistochemistry and western 
      blot methods. RESULTS: 66.18% hemodialysis patients were malnutrition. In 
      hemodialysis patients, the calcified depositions were mainly located in the 
      medial layer of the radial arteries and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP were both 
      increased in the calcified areas. The levels of serum albumin were negatively 
      associated with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP. While 
      MQSGA score, serum phosphorus and calcium x phosphorus product showed positive 
      relationships with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition is prevalent in hemodialysis patients and is associated 
      with arterial calcification and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP in calcified 
      radial arteries. Malnutrition may be a new inducer candidate for arterial 
      calcification in hemodialysis patients.
