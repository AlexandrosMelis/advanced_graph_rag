AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explain China's cigarette pricing mechanism and the role of the 
      Chinese State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA) on cigarette pricing and 
      taxation. METHODS: Published government tobacco tax documentation and statistics 
      published by the Chinese STMA are used to analyse the interrelations among 
      industry profits, taxes and retail price of cigarettes in China. RESULTS: The 
      2009 excise tax increase on cigarettes in China has not translated into higher 
      retail prices because the Chinese STMA used its policy authority to ensure that 
      retail cigarette prices did not change. The government tax increase is being 
      collected at both the producer and wholesale levels. As a result, the 2009 excise 
      tax increase in China has resulted in higher tax revenue for the government and 
      lower profits for the tobacco industry, with no increase in the retail price of 
      cigarettes for consumers. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous studies have found that taxation 
      is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, 
      these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces 
      determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in 
      retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, 
      non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine 
      cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed 
      on to the retail price.
