AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this work is to assess a previously described slit-lamp 
      biomicroscopy-based method (SLBM) for measuring pupil diameter and compare it to 
      Colvard infrared pupillometry (CIP). METHODS: Two examiners performed three 
      repeated measurements with each instrument in 40 healthy eyes. We determined the 
      agreement of SLBM and CIP, intraobserver and interobserver repeatabilities, and 
      interobserver concordance (kappa) and SLBM ability for detecting pupil sizes over 
      6.0 mm. RESULTS: The mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) pupil diameter was 5.81 +/- 
      0.70 mm with SLBM and 6.26 +/- 0.68 mm with CIP (p = 0.01) averaging both 
      examiner's results. Mean differences between the SLBM and CIP were -0.60 mm and 
      -0.30 mm for each examiner using the average of the three readings (p = 0.02), 
      and they were very similar using the first reading. Intraobserver 
      reproducibility: the width of the 95% LoA ranged from 1.79 to 2.30 mm. The ICCs 
      were 0.97 and 0.92 for SLBM, and 0.96 and 0.90 for CIP. Interobserver 
      reproducibility: the width of the LoA ranged from 1.82 to 2.09 mm. Kappa 
      statistics were 0.39 and 0.49 for the first and mean SLBM readings, respectively, 
      and 0.45 for both the first and mean CIP readings. Sensitivity and specificity of 
      SLBM for detection of pupils larger than 6 mm ranged from 55.56% to 73.68% and 
      from 76.19% to 95.45%, respectively. The best trade-off between sensitivity and 
      specificity ranged from 5.4 mm to 6.2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Although the SLBM is quite 
      repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of 
      agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 
      6 mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous 
      grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, 
      and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the 
      SLBM.
