AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the role of surgical ablation targeting the 
      autonomous nervous system during a Cox-Maze IV procedure in the maintenance of 
      sinus rhythm at long-term follow-up. METHODS: The patient population consisted of 
      519 subjects with persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) 
      undergoing radiofrequency Maze IV during open heart surgery between January 2006 
      and July 2013 at three institutions without (Group 1) or with (Group 2) 
      ganglionated plexi (GP) ablation. Recurrence of atrial fibrillation 
      off-antiarrhythmic drugs was the primary outcome. Predictors of AF recurrence 
      were evaluated by means of competing risk regression. Median follow-up was 36.7 
      months. RESULTS: The percentage of patients in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) 
      off-antiarrhythmic drugs did not differ between groups (Group 1-75.5%, Group 
      2-67.8%, p = 0.08). Duration of AF >/= 38 months (p = 0.01), left atrial diameter >/= 
      54 mm (0.001), left atrial area >/= 33 cm(2) (p = 0.005), absence of connecting 
      lesions (p= 0.04), and absence of right atrial ablation (p < 0.001) were 
      independently associated with high incidence of AF recurrence. In contrast the 
      absence of GP ablation was not a significant factor (p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: GP 
      ablation did not prove to be beneficial for postoperative stable NSR. A complete 
      left atrial lesion set and biatrial ablation are advisable for improving rhythm 
      outcomes. Randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm our findings.
