TI  - The Omega-3 Index: a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease?
PG  - 212-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic 
      acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from 
      coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or 
      fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of 
      about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects 
      long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter 
      called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD. 
      METHODS: We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data 
      necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The 
      relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially 
      sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and 
      secondary prevention studies. RESULTS: The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated 
      with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of > or = 8% was associated with 
      the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of < or = 4% was associated with 
      the least. CONCLUSION: The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically 
      relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD 
      that could have significant clinical utility.
