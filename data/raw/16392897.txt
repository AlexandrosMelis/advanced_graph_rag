TI  - BCRABL transcript detection by quantitative real-time PCR : are correlated 
      results possible from homebrew assays?
PG  - 187-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative real-time PCR has become the predominant molecular 
      technique to monitor BCRABL levels in response to treatment in Ph(+) leukemia 
      patients. However, without some form of standardized methodology between 
      laboratories, the correlation of results is difficult. METHODS: Using 
      TaqMan-based assays, parallel quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed 
      on 70 clinical specimens at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Virginia 
      Commonwealth University. While the same positive control cell line (K562) and 
      quality control gene (BCR) were used, the RNA isolation technique, cDNA 
      synthesis, BCR control cell line, and PCR primer and probe sequences were 
      different. RESULTS: The detection of BCRABL-positive results spanned a dynamic 
      range from 10(0) to 10(5)/100,000 cells. Forty-three samples were negative at 
      both facilities. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was performed for the 22 
      BCRABL-positive paired results. The correlation coefficient, r(s), was 0.9435 (p 
      < 0.00001), suggesting a strong correlation of the results. One discordant result 
      was obtained for consecutive samples from one patient with a low BCRABL copy 
      number as a result of a minimal RNA yield at one laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest that quantitative real-time PCR assays for BCRABL detection can 
      be comparable between laboratories despite significant differences in 
      methodologies if the same positive control cell line and quality control gene are 
      used. It is imperative that some level of assay standardization be adopted 
      between laboratories, not only for patients who are monitored at different 
      facilities, but also for larger investigative studies in which hematologic, 
      cytogenetic and molecular responses are to be compared.
