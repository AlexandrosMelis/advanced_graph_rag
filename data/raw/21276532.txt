AB  - BACKGROUND: Complications associated with blood transfusions have resulted in 
      widespread acceptance of low hematocrit levels in surgical patients. However, 
      preoperative anemia seems to be a risk factor for adverse postoperative outcomes 
      in certain surgical patients. This study investigated the National Surgical 
      Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database to determine if preoperative anemia 
      in patients undergoing open and laparoscopic colectomies is an independent 
      predictor for an adverse composite outcome (CO) consisting of myocardial 
      infarction, stroke, progressive renal insufficiency or death within 30 days of 
      operation, or for an increased hospital length of stay (LOS). STUDY DESIGN: 
      Hematocrit levels were categorized into 4 classes: severe, moderate, mild, and no 
      anemia. From 2005 to 2008, the NSQIP database recorded 23,348 elective open and 
      laparoscopic colectomies that met inclusion criteria. Analyses using 
      multivariable models, controlling for potential confounders and stratifying on 
      propensity score, were performed. RESULTS: Compared with nonanemic patients, 
      those with severe, moderate, and mild anemia were more likely to have the adverse 
      CO with odds ratios of 1.83 (95% CI 1.05 to 3.19), 2.19 (95 % CI 1.63 to 2.94), 
      and 1.49 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.86), respectively. Patients with a normal hematocrit 
      had a reduced hospital LOS, compared with those with severe, moderate, and mild 
      anemia (p < 0.01). A history of cardiovascular disease did not significantly 
      influence these findings. CONCLUSIONS: This large multicenter database analysis 
      suggests that the presence of severe and moderate and even mild preoperative 
      anemia is an independent risk factor for complications and a longer hospital stay 
      after colon surgery.
