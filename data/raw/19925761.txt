AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and safety of diagnostic or therapeutic 
      semirigid ureteroscopy without ureteral meatus dilatation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      A comparative, retrospective study was conducted of patients undergoing 
      ureteroscopy from January 2000 to May 2008. For data analysis purposes, the 
      population was divided into two groups based on whether ureteroscopy had been 
      performed with (Group 1) or without (Group 2) ureteral meatus dilatation. 
      Variables recorded included age, sex, type of procedure, surgical diagnosis, 
      passive or active dilatation, number of stones, stone location, stone diameter, 
      peroperative and postoperative complications, internal urinary diversion after 
      the procedure, therapeutic success rate, operating time, and hospital stay 
      duration. A 8-9.8 Fr Wolf semirigid ureteroscope was used. Descriptive statistics 
      of the population and cohorts were performed, providing medians, quartiles, and 
      limit values for non-normally distributed interval variables, and absolute and 
      relative frequencies for categorical variables. Shapiro-Wilk's, Mann-Whitney's U, 
      Chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used for statistical analysis. A value 
      of p 2 alpha < or = 0.005 was considered statistically significant. Arcus 
      Quickstat Biomedical 1.0 software was used. RESULTS: Among the 306 ureteroscopies 
      studied, 286 performed in 256 patients were analyzed. Median age was 50 years 
      (16-83), 59% of patients were male, and elective ureteroscopy was performed in 
      183 patients (64%). Group 1: 191 ureteroscopies, Group 2: 95 ureteroscopies. 
      Stone location: 149 in distal ureter, 60 in middle ureter, and 35 in proximal 
      ureter. Sixty-nine percent of stones had sizes ranging from 5 and 10 mm. The 
      overall success rate was 86.5%. There were 5 peroperative and 22 postoperative 
      complications, with no statistically significant differences between the groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In selected cases, ureteroscopy may be performed without ureteral 
      meatus dilatation with success and morbidity rates similar to when the procedure 
      is performed with meatal dilatation.
