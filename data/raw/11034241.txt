TI  - Is routine intraoperative frozen-section examination of sentinel lymph nodes in 
      breast cancer worthwhile?
PG  - 651-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine intraoperative frozen section (FS) of sentinel lymph nodes 
      (SLN) can detect metastatic disease, allowing immediate axillary dissection and 
      avoiding the need for reoperation. Routine FS is also costly, increases operative 
      time, and is subject to false-negative results. We examined the benefit of 
      routine intraoperative FS among the first 1000 patients at Memorial Sloan 
      Kettering Cancer Center who had SLN biopsy for breast cancer. METHODS: We 
      performed SLN biopsy with intraoperative FS in 890 consecutive breast cancer 
      patients, none of whom had a back-up axillary dissection planned in advance. 
      Serial sections and immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratins were performed 
      on all SLN that proved negative on FS. The sensitivity of FS was determined as a 
      function of (1) tumor size and (2) volume of metastatic disease in the SLN, and 
      the benefit of FS was defined as the avoidance of a reoperative axillary 
      dissection. RESULTS: The sensitivity of FS ranged from 40% for patients with Tla 
      to 76% for patients with T2 cancers. The volume of SLN metastasis was highly 
      correlated with tumor size, and FS was far more effective in detecting 
      macrometastatic disease (sensitivity 92%) than micrometastases (sensitivity 17%). 
      The benefit of FS in avoiding reoperative axillary dissection ranged from 4% for 
      Tla (6 of 143) to 38% for T2 (45 of 119) cancers. CONCLUSIONS: In breast cancer 
      patients having SLN biopsy, the failure of routine intraoperative FS is largely 
      the failure to detect micrometastatic disease. The benefit of routine 
      intraoperative FS increases with tumor size. Routine FS may not be indicated in 
      patients with the smallest invasive cancers.
