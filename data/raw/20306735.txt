PG  - 177-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the perspectives of Trainee Ophthalmologist Diplomats 
      (TOD) on the Ophthalmic Diploma Training (ODT) in West Africa with a view to 
      improving the programme. METHODS: A survey of set 2005 TOD on ODT was carried out 
      in Ghana, 2006. RESULTS: The trainees included 10 (83.35%) males and two (16.7%) 
      females whose ages ranged between thirty-two and fifty-one years. The sponsors of 
      the trainees included Sight Savers International, five (41.7%); Christian Blind 
      Mission International, three (25.0%); Eye Foundation, Lagos, Nigeria two (16.7%); 
      Ministry of Defence Nigeria, one (8.3%); and Health Authority Ghana, one (8.3%). 
      Nine trainees (75.0%) felt the programme was well structured, training allowances 
      were adequate eight (66.7%) and inadequate four (33.3%). Eleven (91.7%) trainees 
      would work wherever they were posted; ten (83.3%) trainees had sense of 
      fulfillment and three (25%) would like to proceed for residency training. All 
      trainees were at least good in chalazion surgery and treatment of common medical 
      eye conditions. Majority were at least good in eye surgery like cataract, eleven 
      (91.7%); trabeculectomy nine (75.0%); pterygium 10 (83.3%); eyelid, eight 
      (66.7%); destructive 11 (91.6%) and refraction 9 (75.0%). Some trainees' 
      perceived problems included inadequate sponsorship (33.3%), short duration of the 
      course four (33.3%) and poor accommodation facility two (16.7%). However, 
      trainees' suggested increase in training posts, four (33.3); training allowance 
      three (25.0%); and incentives for trainers/training hospitals two (16.7%). 
      CONCLUSION: The ODT programme ensures ophthalmic manpower for secondary eye care 
      level despite challenges. The stakeholders should look into problems facing the 
      programme in order to improve it.
