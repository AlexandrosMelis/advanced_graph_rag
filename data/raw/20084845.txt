AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurate and updated information on airborne pollen in specific areas 
      can help allergic patients. Current monitoring systems are based on a morphologic 
      identification approach, a time-consuming method that may represent a limiting 
      factor for sampling network enhancement. OBJECTIVE: To verify the feasibility of 
      developing a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, an alternative 
      to optical analysis, as a rapid, accurate, and automated tool for the detection 
      and quantification of airborne allergenic pollen taxa. METHODS: The traditional 
      cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide-based method was modified for DNA isolation from 
      pollen. Taxon-specific DNA sequences were identified via bioinformatics or 
      literature searches and were PCR amplified from the matching allergenic taxa; 
      based on the sequences of PCR products, complementary or degenerate TaqMan probes 
      were developed. The accuracy of the quantitative real-time PCR assay was tested 
      on 3 plant species. RESULTS: The setup of a modified DNA extraction protocol 
      allowed us to achieve good-quality pollen DNA. Taxon-specific nuclear gene 
      fragments were identified and sequenced. Designed primer pairs and probes 
      identified selected pollen taxa, mostly at the required classification level. 
      Pollen was properly identified even when collected on routine aerobiological 
      tape. Preliminary quantification assays on pollen grains were successfully 
      performed on test species and in mixes. CONCLUSIONS: The real-time PCR approach 
      revealed promising results in pollen identification and quantification, even when 
      analyzing pollen mixes. Future perspectives could concern the development of 
      multiplex real-time PCR for the simultaneous detection of different taxa in the 
      same reaction tube and the application of high-throughput molecular methods.
