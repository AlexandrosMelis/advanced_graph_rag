AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine if elderly patients with oropharyngeal 
      squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are receiving less treatment and to evaluate the 
      benefit of aggressive therapy in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective 
      analysis of a large population database. METHODS: Patients in the Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results database with OPSCC diagnosed from 2004 to 2009 
      were included. The patients were categorized into age groups 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 
      65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85 years and older, then further categorized by treatment 
      status. Kaplan-Meier analysis of disease-specific survival (DSS) for late-stage 
      (III and IV) OPSCC was performed for all age and treatment categories, followed 
      by a multivariate cox regression of treatment status, tumor site, race, stage, 
      and sex per age group. RESULTS: A total of 14,909 patients with OPSCC were 
      identified. In our demographic data, we observed a significant increase in the 
      number of patients who did not receive treatment (surgery, radiation, or combined 
      therapy) after age 55. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that age groups 65 to 74 and 
      75 to 84 had substantial benefits in DSS with surgery, radiation, or combined 
      therapy. Multivariable analysis did not demonstrate any statistically significant 
      difference in the hazard ratios for combined treatment among age groups 45 to 54, 
      55 to 64, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84. CONCLUSIONS: Proportionally fewer elderly 
      patients with OPSCC are being treated than younger individuals. These patients 
      can have significant benefits from aggressive treatments despite their older age 
      as shown by our survival analysis. We recommend the use of objective measures to 
      assess patient fitness to reduce the potential for undertreatment in the elderly 
      population.
