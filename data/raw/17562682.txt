TI  - Is Panton-Valentine leucocidin associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus 
      aureus bacteraemia in the UK?
PG  - 402-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The morbidity and mortality associated with Panton-Valentine 
      leucocidin (PVL)-positive Staphylococcus aureus suggest that this toxin is a key 
      marker of disease severity. Nevertheless, the importance of PVL in the 
      pathogenesis of primary bacteraemia caused by S. aureus is uncertain. We have 
      determined the prevalence of PVL-encoding genes among isolates of S. aureus from 
      bacteraemic patients. METHODS: Consecutive bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus 
      (n=244) from patients hospitalized in 25 centres in the UK and Ireland during 
      2005 were screened for PVL and mecA genes. PVL-positive isolates were 
      characterized by toxin gene profiling, PFGE, spa-typing and MIC determinations 
      for a range of antimicrobials. RESULTS: Four out of 244 isolates (1.6%) were 
      PVL-positive and susceptible to oxacillin [methicillin-susceptible S. aureus 
      (MSSA)]. Eighty-eight out of 244 (36%) were oxacillin-resistant 
      (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), but none was PVL-positive. The four patients 
      (two males: 30 and 33 years; two females: 62 and 80 years) had infection foci of: 
      skin and soft tissue, unknown, indwelling line, and surgical site, and were 
      located at one centre in Wales, one in England and two in Ireland. One of four 
      PVL-positive isolates was resistant to penicillin and fusidic acid, the remainder 
      were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Genotypic analyses showed that the 
      four isolates represented three distinct strains; the two isolates from Ireland 
      were related. CONCLUSIONS: We found that 1.6% of S. aureus (all MSSA) from 
      bacteraemic patients were PVL-positive. This low incidence suggests that 
      PVL-positive S. aureus are of no particular significance as causative agents of 
      S. aureus bacteraemia.
