TI  - PSA repeatedly fluctuating levels are reassuring enough to avoid biopsy?
PG  - 203-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can show wide fluctuations 
      when repeatedly measured. Here we investigatewd if: (a) biopsy timing influences 
      the prostate cancer (PC) detection rate in patients with fluctuating PSA 
      (flu-PSA) in comparison with patients with steadily increasing PSA (si-PSA); (b) 
      PSA slope estimated in patients with flu-PSA predicts a different risk of cancer 
      detection; (c) flu-PSA and si-PSA patients develop PC in topographically 
      different sites; (d) the behaviour of pre-operative PSA is an expression of a 
      disease with defferent characteristics to the following radical prostatectomy. 
      METHODS: The study involved 211 patients who underwent at least a second biopsy 
      after a first negative prostate biopsy. PSA Slope, PSA velocity (PSAV) and PSA 
      doubling time (PSADT) were estimated. Flu-PSA level was defined as a PSA series 
      with at least one PSA value lower than the one immediately preceding it. RESULTS: 
      82 patients had flu-PSA levels and 129 si-PSA levels. There were no significant 
      differences between the two groups in terms of cancer detection, clinical or 
      pathological stage, but the si-PSA group with cancer had a higher Gleason score. 
      No difference was found for PSA Slope between flu-PSA patients with cancer and 
      those without. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates no difference in PC detection 
      rate at repeat biopsy between patients with flu or si-PSA levels. PSA Slope, PSAV 
      and PSADT were not found helpful tools in cancer detection.
