AB  - BACKGROUND: Longitudinally following patients requires a full-time employee 
      (FTE)-dependent data inflow infrastructure. There are efforts to capture 
      patient-reported outcomes (PROs) by the use of non-FTE-dependent methodologies. 
      In this study, we set out to assess the reliability of PRO data captured via 
      FTE-dependent compared with non-FTE-dependent methodologies. METHODS: A total of 
      119 adult patients (65 men) who underwent 1-and 2-level lumbar fusions at Duke 
      University Medical Center were enrolled in this prospective study. Enrollment 
      criteria included available demographic, clinical, and PRO data. All patients 
      completed 2 sets of questionnaires--the first a phone interviews and the second a 
      self-survey. There was at least a 2-week period between the phone interviews and 
      self-survey. Questionnaires included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the 
      visual analog scale for back pain (VAS-BP), and the visual analog scale for leg 
      pain (VAS-LP). Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the 
      reliability of baseline PRO data captured. RESULTS: A total of 39.49% of patients 
      were smokers, 21.00% had diabetes, and 11.76% had coronary artery disease; 26.89% 
      reported history of anxiety disorder, and 28.57% reported history of depression. 
      A total of 97.47% of patients had a high-school diploma or General Education 
      Development, and 49.57% attained a 4-year college degree or postgraduate degree. 
      We observed a high correlation between baseline PRO data captured between 
      FTE-dependent versus non-FTE dependent methodologies (ODI: r = -0.89, VAS-BP: r = 
      0.74, VAS-LP: r = 0.70). There was no difference in PROs of baseline pain and 
      functional disability between FTE-dependent and non-FTE-dependent methodologies: 
      baseline ODI (FTE-dependent: 47.73 +/- 16.77 [mean +/- SD] vs. non-FTE-dependent: 
      45.81 +/- 12.11, P = 0.39), VAS-LP (FTE-dependent: 6.13 +/- 2.78 vs. 
      non-FTE-dependent: 6.46 +/- 2.79, P = 0.36) and VAS-BP (FTE-dependent: 6.33 +/- 2.90 
      vs. non-FTE-dependent: 6.53 +/- 2.48, P = 0.57). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests 
      that there is great reliability between PRO data captured between FTE-dependent 
      and non-FTE-dependent methodologies.
