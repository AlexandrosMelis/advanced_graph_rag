TI  - Pancreas retransplantation: a second chance for diabetic patients?

AB  - BACKGROUND: If pancreas transplantation is a validated alternative for type 1 
      diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease, the management of patients who 
      have lost their primary graft is poorly defined. This study aims at evaluating 
      pancreas retransplantation outcome. METHODS: Between 1976 and 2008, 569 pancreas 
      transplantations were performed in Lyon and Geneva, including 37 second 
      transplantations. Second graft survival was compared with primary graft survival 
      of the same patients and the whole population. Predictive factors of second graft 
      survival were sought. Patient survival and impact on kidney graft function and 
      survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Second pancreas survival of the 17 patients 
      transplanted from 1995 was close to primary graft survival of the whole 
      population (71% vs. 79% at 1 year and 59% vs. 69% at 5 years; P=0.5075) and 
      significantly better than their first pancreas survival (71% vs. 29% at 1 year 
      and 59% vs. 7% at 5 years; P=0.0008) regardless of the cause of first pancreas 
      loss. The same results were observed with all 37 retransplantations. Survival of 
      second simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantations was better than survival 
      of second pancreas after kidney. Patient survival was excellent (89% at 5 years). 
      Pancreas retransplantation had no impact on kidney graft function and survival 
      (100% at 5 years). CONCLUSION: Pancreas retransplantation is a safe procedure 
      with acceptable graft survival that should be proposed to diabetic patients who 
      have lost their primary graft.
