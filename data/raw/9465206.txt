      for diagnostic arthroscopy?].
PG  - 433-9
AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the actual role of MRI versus arthroscopy in the 
      detection and characterization of occult bone and/or cartilage injuries in 
      patients with previous musculoskeletal trauma of the knee, pain and severe 
      functional impairment. Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee 
      are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; 
      age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, 
      negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients 
      were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 
      0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat 
      suppression. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified three types of occult 
      post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone 
      bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. 
      Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was 
      defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on 
      T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR 
      images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while 
      osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the 
      same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 
      cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury 
      site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated 
      with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 
      90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral 
      compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 
      16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 
      8.3%. In 6 stress injuries, the injury site was localized in the medial tibial 
      condyle in 80% of cases, while meniscal and ligament tears were absent. 
      CONCLUSIONS: After comparing MR with arthroscopic findings and reviewing the 
      available literature, we conclude that arthroscopy permits the direct 
      visualization of even fine articular surface changes but does not depict the 
      subchondral bone, the most frequent site of injury detected with MRI. MRI was a 
      very useful tool in the detection and characterization of the different types of 
      occult bone and/or cartilage injuries and showed a statistically significant 
      correlation between site and distribution of bone and cartilage injuries and 
      between internal damage and trauma mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that MRI can 
      help avoid diagnostic arthroscopy in the patients with a history of 
      post-traumatic pain, acute articular blocks and negative radiographic findings.
