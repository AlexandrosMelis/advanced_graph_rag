TI  - Adjuvant radiation of stage III thymoma: is it necessary?
PG  - 1834-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The criteria for administration of adjuvant radiation therapy after 
      thymoma resection remains controversial, and it is unclear whether patients with 
      Masaoka stage III thymoma benefit from adjuvant radiation. The goal of this 
      report was to determine whether or not this group benefits from radiation therapy 
      in disease-specific survival and disease-free survival. METHODS: Case records of 
      the Massachusetts General Hospital were retrospectively reviewed from 1972 to 
      2004. One hundred and seventy-nine patients underwent resection for thymoma, of 
      which 45 had stage III disease. RESULTS: Forty-five stage III patients underwent 
      resection and in 36 it was complete. Thirty-eight stage III patients received 
      radiation therapy. Baseline prognostic factors between radiated and nonradiated 
      groups were similar. The addition of adjuvant radiotherapy did not alter local or 
      distant recurrence rates in patients with stage III thymoma. Disease-specific 
      survival at 10 years in stage III patients who did not receive radiation was 75% 
      (95% confidence interval, 32% to 100%) and in patients who did receive radiation 
      therapy it was 79% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 94%) (p = 0.21). The most 
      common site of relapse was the pleura. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients who have stage 
      III thymoma undergo complete resection. Some patients enjoy prolonged 
      disease-free survival without adjuvant radiation after resection of stage III 
      thymoma. Radiation does not seem to prevent pleural recurrences when given after 
      resection of stage III thymomas. The use of routine adjuvant radiation after a 
      complete resection of stage III thymoma needs to be re-addressed. There may be a 
      role for the use of chemotherapy to reduce pleural recurrences.
