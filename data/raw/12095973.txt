TI  - Chemoradiation instead of surgery to treat mid and low rectal tumors: is it safe?
PG  - 568-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main treatment for rectal carcinoma is surgery. Preoperative 
      chemoradiation (CRT) is advocated to reduce local recurrence and improve 
      resection of mid and low tethered rectal tumors. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with 
      mid or low rectal tumors underwent CRT (external beam radiation plus 
      5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid). Patients who had low rectal tumors with 
      complete response (CR) were not submitted to surgical treatment. All other 
      patients were submitted to surgery, independently of the response. Mean follow-up 
      was 32.1 months. RESULTS: Five-year overall survival was 60.5%. Clinical 
      evaluation after CRT showed CR in 10 cases (19.2%), all low tumors; incomplete 
      response (>50%) in 21 (40.4%); and no response (<50%) in 19 (36.6%). Among the 10 
      cases with CR, 8 presented with local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months. Two 
      patients were not submitted to surgery and are still alive without cancer after 
      37 and 58 months. Thirty-nine patients had radical surgery. Seven had local 
      recurrences after CRT plus surgery (17.9%). Overall survival was negatively 
      affected by lymph node metastases (P =.017) and perineural invasion (P =.026). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive CRT approach is not safe to treat patients with low 
      infiltrative rectal carcinoma.
