TI  - Is anorectal endosonography valuable in dyschesia?
PG  - 695-700
AB  - AIMS: Dyschesia can be provoked by inappropriate defecation movements. The aim of 
      this prospective study was to demonstrate dysfunction of the anal sphincter 
      and/or the musculus (m.) puborectalis in patients with dyschesia using anorectal 
      endosonography. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with a medical history of 
      dyschesia and a control group of 20 healthy subjects underwent linear anorectal 
      endosonography (Toshiba models IUV 5060 and PVL-625 RT). In both groups, the 
      dimensions of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis were measured at rest, 
      and during voluntary squeezing and straining. Statistical analysis was performed 
      within and between the two groups. RESULTS: The anal sphincter became 
      paradoxically shorter and/or thicker during straining (versus the resting state) 
      in 85% of patients but in only 35% of control subjects. Changes in sphincter 
      length were statistically significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in 
      patients compared with control subjects. The m. puborectalis became paradoxically 
      shorter and/or thicker during straining in 80% of patients but in only 30% of 
      controls. Both the changes in length and thickness of the m. puborectalis were 
      significantly different (p<0.01, chi(2) test) in patients versus control 
      subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Linear anorectal endosonography demonstrated incomplete or 
      even absent relaxation of the anal sphincter and the m. puborectalis during a 
      defecation movement in the majority of our patients with dyschesia. This study 
      highlights the value of this elegant ultrasonographic technique in the diagnosis 
      of "pelvic floor dyssynergia" or "anismus".
