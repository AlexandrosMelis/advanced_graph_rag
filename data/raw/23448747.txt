TI  - Do older adults with cancer fall more often? A comparative analysis of falls in 
      those with and without cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine whether a history of cancer increased the 
      likelihood of a fall in community-dwelling older adults, and if cancer type, 
      stage, or time since diagnosis increased falls. DESIGN: A longitudinal, 
      retrospective, cohort study. SETTING: A home- and community-based waiver program 
      in Michigan. SAMPLE: 862 older adults aged 65 years or older with cancer compared 
      to 8,617 older adults without cancer using data from the Minimum Data Set-Home 
      Care and Michigan cancer registry. METHODS: Reports of falls were examined for 
      90-180 days. Generalized estimating equations were used to compare differences 
      between the groups. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Cancer, falls, patient 
      characteristics, comorbidities, medications, pain, weight loss, vision, memory 
      recall, and activities, as well as cancer type, stage, and time since diagnosis. 
      FINDINGS: A fall occurred at a rate of 33% in older adults with cancer compared 
      to 29% without cancer (p < 0.00). Those with a history of cancer were more likely 
      to fall than those without cancer (adjusted odds ratio 1.16; 95% confidence 
      interval [1.02, 1.33]; p = 0.03). No differences in fall rates were determined by 
      cancer type or stage, and the odds of a fall did not increase when adding time 
      since cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The fall rate was higher in older adults 
      with cancer than in older adults without cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses 
      need to assess fall risk and initiate fall prevention measures for older adults 
      at the time of cancer diagnosis. KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION: When caring for older 
      adults with cancer, nurses should be aware of an increased risk for falls. 
      Healthcare staff also should be aware of an increased risk for falls in that 
      population during cancer treatment. Evidence-based fall prevention measures 
      should be included in care plans for older adult cancer survivors.
