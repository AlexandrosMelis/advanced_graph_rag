      daily CT on rails : Does target motion differ between superior and inferior 
      portions of the clinical target volume?

AB  - PURPOSE: Using high-quality CT-on-rails imaging, the daily motion of the prostate 
      bed clinical target volume (PB-CTV) based on consensus Radiation Therapy Oncology 
      Group (RTOG) definitions (instead of surgical clips/fiducials) was studied. It 
      was assessed whether PB motion in the superior portion of PB-CTV (SUP-CTV) 
      differed from the inferior PB-CTV (INF-CTV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight 
      pT2-3bN0-1M0 patients underwent postprostatectomy intensity-modulated 
      radiotherapy, totaling 300 fractions. INF-CTV and SUP-CTV were defined as PB-CTV 
      located inferior and superior to the superior border of the pubic symphysis, 
      respectively. Daily pretreatment CT-on-rails images were compared to the planning 
      CT in the left-right (LR), superoinferior (SI), and anteroposterior (AP) 
      directions. Two parameters were defined: "total PB-CTV motion" represented total 
      shifts from skin tattoos to RTOG-defined anatomic areas; "PB-CTV target motion" 
      (performed for both SUP-CTV and INF-CTV) represented shifts from bone to 
      RTOG-defined anatomic areas (i. e., subtracting shifts from skin tattoos to 
      bone). RESULTS: Mean (+/- standard deviation, SD) total PB-CTV motion was 
      -1.5 (+/- 6.0), 1.3 (+/- 4.5), and 3.7 (+/- 5.7) mm in LR, SI, and AP directions, 
      respectively. Mean (+/- SD) PB-CTV target motion was 0.2 (+/-1.4), 0.3 (+/-2.4), and 
      0 (+/-3.1) mm in the LR, SI, and AP directions, respectively. Mean (+/- SD) INF-CTV 
      target motion was 0.1 (+/- 2.8), 0.5 (+/- 2.2), and 0.2 (+/- 2.5) mm, and SUP-CTV 
      target motion was 0.3 (+/- 1.8), 0.5 (+/- 2.3), and 0 (+/- 5.0) mm in LR, SI, and AP 
      directions, respectively. No statistically significant differences between 
      INF-CTV and SUP-CTV motion were present in any direction. CONCLUSION: There are 
      no statistically apparent motion differences between SUP-CTV and INF-CTV. Current 
      uniform planning target volume (PTV) margins are adequate to cover both portions 
      of the CTV.
