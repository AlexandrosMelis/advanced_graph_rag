AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with recurrent protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and 
      bronchiectasis share common features, and PBB is likely a forerunner to 
      bronchiectasis. Both diseases are associated with neutrophilic inflammation and 
      frequent isolation of potentially pathogenic microorganisms, including 
      nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), from the lower airway. Defective 
      alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic bronchial epithelial cells 
      (efferocytosis), as found in other chronic lung diseases, may also contribute to 
      tissue damage and neutrophil persistence. Thus, in children with bronchiectasis 
      or PBB and in control subjects, we quantified the phagocytosis of airway 
      apoptotic cells and NTHi by alveolar macrophages and related the phagocytic 
      capacity to clinical and airway inflammation. METHODS: Children with 
      bronchiectasis (n = 55) or PBB (n = 13) and control subjects (n = 13) were 
      recruited. Alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, efferocytosis, and expression of 
      phagocytic scavenger receptors were assessed by flow cytometry. Bronchoalveolar 
      lavage fluid interleukin (IL) 1beta was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay. RESULTS: For children with PBB or bronchiectasis, macrophage phagocytic 
      capacity was significantly lower than for control subjects (P = .003 and P < .001 
      for efferocytosis and P = .041 and P = .004 for phagocytosis of NTHi; PBB and 
      bronchiectasis, respectively); median phagocytosis of NTHi for the groups was as 
      follows: bronchiectasis, 13.7% (interquartile range [IQR], 11%-16%); PBB, 16% 
      (IQR, 11%-16%); control subjects, 19.0% (IQR, 13%-21%); and median efferocytosis 
      for the groups was as follows: bronchiectasis, 14.1% (IQR, 10%-16%); PBB, 16.2% 
      (IQR, 14%-17%); control subjects, 18.1% (IQR, 16%-21%). Mannose receptor 
      expression was significantly reduced in the bronchiectasis group (P = .019), and 
      IL-1beta increased in both bronchiectasis and PBB groups vs control subjects. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytic host response to apoptotic 
      cells or NTHi may contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and NTHi colonization 
      in both PBB and bronchiectasis. Whether this mechanism also contributes to the 
      progression of PBB to bronchiectasis remains unknown.
