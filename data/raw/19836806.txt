AB  - PURPOSE: Obesity may be associated with lower prostate specific antigen through 
      hemodilution. We examined the relationship between body mass index and prostate 
      specific antigen by age in men without prostate cancer in a longitudinal aging 
      study to determine whether prostate specific antigen must be adjusted for body 
      mass index. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included 994 men (4,937 
      observations) without prostate cancer in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of 
      Aging. Mixed effects models were used to examine the relationship between 
      prostate specific antigen and body mass index in kg/m(2) by age. Separate models 
      were explored in men with prostate cancer censored at diagnosis, for percent body 
      fat measurements, for weight changes with time and adjusting for initial prostate 
      size in 483 men (2,523 observations) with pelvic magnetic resonance imaging 
      measurements. RESULTS: In men without prostate cancer body mass index was not 
      significantly associated with prostate specific antigen after adjusting for age 
      (p = 0.06). A 10-point body mass index increase was associated with a prostate 
      specific antigen difference of -0.03 ng/ml (95% CI -0.40-0.49). Results were 
      similar when men with prostate cancer were included, when percent body fat was 
      substituted for body mass index, and after adjusting for prostate volume. 
      Longitudinal weight changes also had no significant association with prostate 
      specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with prior studies, we found an inverse 
      relationship between obesity and serum prostate specific antigen. However, the 
      magnitude of the difference was small. Thus, adjusting prostate specific antigen 
      for body mass index does not appear warranted.
