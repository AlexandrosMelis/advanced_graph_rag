AB  - OBJECTIVE: Treatment of neonatal testicular torsion has two objectives: salvage 
      of the involved testicle (which is rarely achieved) and preservation of the 
      contralateral gonad. The second goal universally involves contralateral 
      testicular scrotal fixation to prevent the future occurrence of contralateral 
      torsion. However, there is controversy with regards to management of a 
      synchronous contralateral hydrocele. It has been our policy not to address the 
      contralateral hydrocele through an inguinal incision to minimize potential injury 
      to the spermatic cord. Our objective in this study was to determine whether the 
      decision to manage a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular 
      torsion solely through a scrotal approach is safe and effective. PATIENTS AND 
      METHOD: We reviewed all cases of neonatal testicular torsion occurring at our 
      institution between the years 1999 and 2006. Age at presentation, physical 
      examination, ultrasonographic and intraoperative findings were recorded. Patients 
      were followed after initial surgical intervention to determine the likelihood of 
      developing a subsequent hydrocele or hernia. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were 
      identified as presenting with neonatal torsion. Age of presentation averaged 3.5 
      days (range 1-14 days). Left-sided pathology was seen more commonly than the 
      right, with a 25:12 distribution. All torsed testicles were nonviable. Twenty-two 
      patients were noted to have a contralateral hydrocele at presentation. All 
      hydroceles were opened through a scrotal approach at the time of contralateral 
      scrotal fixation. No patient underwent an inguinal exploration to examine for a 
      patent process vaginalis. None of the patients who presented with a hydrocele 
      have developed a clinical hydrocele or hernia after an average 7.5 years (range 
      4.3-11.2) follow-up. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that approaching a 
      contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a 
      scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in 
      our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have 
      brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not 
      subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. 
      Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. 
      In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does 
      not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative 
      management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord 
      injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.
