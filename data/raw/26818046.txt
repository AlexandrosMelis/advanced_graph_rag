AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical effect (efficacy and tolerability) of high 
      doses of zonisamide (ZNS) (>500 mg/d) in adult patients with pharmacoresistant 
      epilepsy. METHODS: Between 2006 and 2013, all epileptic outpatients treated with 
      high doses of ZNS were selected. Safety and efficacy were assessed based on 
      patient and caregiver reports. Serum levels of ZNS and other concomitant 
      antiepileptic drugs were evaluated if available. RESULTS: Nine patients (5 
      female): 8 focal/1 generalized pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Mean age: 34 years. 
      Most frequent seizure type: complex partial seizures; other seizure types: 
      generalized tonic-clonic, tonic, myoclonia. Zonisamide in polytherapy in all 
      (100%), administered in tritherapy in 3 (33%) of 9 patients; mean dose: 633 
      (600-700) mg/d; efficacy (>50% seizure reduction) was observed in 5 (55%) of 9 
      patients. Five of 9 patients are still taking high doses of ZNS (more than 1 
      year). Adverse events were observed in 3 (37%) of 8 patients. Good tolerance to 
      high doses of other antiepileptic drugs had been observed in 6 (66%) of 9 
      patients. Plasma levels of ZNS were only available in 2 patients; both were in 
      the therapeutic range (34.95, 30.91) (10-40 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: High doses of ZNS 
      are effective and safe in pharmacoresistant epileptic patients. Therapeutic drug 
      monitoring of ZNS may be considered at therapeutic failure.
