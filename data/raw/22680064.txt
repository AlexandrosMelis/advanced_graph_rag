AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the ability of early sonogram to predict the presentation 
      of twin A at birth. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on all 
      twin pregnancies evaluated at our Fetal Evaluation Unit from 2007 to 2009. 
      Sonogram records were reviewed for the presentation of twin A at seven 
      gestational age intervals and inpatient medical records were reviewed for the 
      presentation of twin A at delivery. The positive predictive value, sensitivity, 
      and specificity of presentation as determined by ultrasound, at each gestational 
      age interval, for the same presentation at delivery were calculated. RESULTS: Two 
      hundred and thirty-eight twin pregnancies met inclusion criteria. A total of 896 
      ultrasounds were reviewed. The positive predictive value of cephalic presentation 
      of twin A as determined by ultrasound for the persistence of cephalic 
      presentation at delivery reached 95% after 28 weeks gestation. The positive 
      predictive value for noncephalic presentation as established by sonogram for 
      noncephalic at delivery was >90% after 32 weeks gestation. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      presentation of the first twin at delivery can be determined by sonogram by the 
      32nd week of gestation in over 90% of twin pregnancies.
