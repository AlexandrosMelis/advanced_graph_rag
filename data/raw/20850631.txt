AB  - PURPOSE: We investigated the efficacy of ultrasound in determining megarectum and 
      fecal load and the response to treatment in constipation and tried to specify 
      objective criteria in this study. METHODS: A total of 66 cases were queried and 
      divided into 2 groups as constipated (n = 35; mean age, 6.8 +/- 2.9 years) and 
      control (n = 31; mean age, 8.4 +/- 3.8 years) according to Rome III criteria. After 
      the clinical evaluation, pelvic ultrasonography (US) was performed by 2 separate 
      radiologists. The bladder capacity and the transverse rectal diameter were 
      measured with a full bladder. Then the rectal diameter and rectal anterior wall 
      thickness were measured, and the presence of fecal load in the rectum and sigmoid 
      colon was recorded with an empty bladder. The examination and ultrasound were 
      repeated after treatment for a month in these patients. RESULTS: Comparison of 
      the US measurements of the 2 radiologists performing the US tests did not show 
      any interobserver difference (r = 0.981; P < .001). We therefore believe our 
      results are objective and reproducible. We found a positive correlation between 
      the rectal diameters and the age, height, weight, and bladder capacity. The 
      posturination mean rectal diameter was thicker in the constipated group (3.02 +/- 
      1.04 cm) than in the control group (1.98 +/- 0.64 cm) (P < .001). The cutoff point 
      of rectal diameter for a diagnosis of constipation was determined as 2.44 cm (71% 
      sensitive; 76% specific; area under curve, 0.825; P < .001). The rectal anterior 
      wall thickness and fecal load were higher in the constipated patients (P < .001). 
      There was a significant decrease in the constipation score and fecal load after 
      treatment for a month (P < .001), but the rectal diameter had not reached normal 
      limits yet despite the decrease (2.71 +/- 0.77 cm) (P > .05). CONCLUSION: The use 
      of US helps in making a correct diagnosis and in the follow-up with objective 
      criteria and also convinces the patient and the family that the treatment needs 
      to be continued.
