AB  - OBJECTIVE: To date, no prospective comparative study of the diagnostic value of 
      STIR versus T1-weighted (T1w) sequences at both 1.5 T and 3 T has been performed 
      with special focus on the detectability of bone metastases. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: 212 oncological patients had a whole-body MRI at 1.5 T and/or at 3 T. 
      The standard protocol comprised STIR and T1w sequences. All patients who showed 
      typical signs of bone metastases were included in the study. Evaluation of the 
      images was performed by the calculation of the number of metastases by three 
      independent readers and by visual assessment on a 4-point scale. RESULTS: 86 
      patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The total number of metastases was 
      significantly higher on T1w than on STIR images at both field strengths (p < 
      0.05). T1w revealed a sensitivity of 99.72% (3 T) and 100.00% (1.5 T) versus STIR 
      with 70.99 % (3 T) and 79.34 % (1.5 T). In 53% (38/72) of all patients, STIR 
      detected fewer bone metastases in comparison with T1w at 3 T. At 1.5 T, STIR 
      showed inferior results in 37.5 % (18/48) of all patients. Qualitative analysis 
      indicated a significantly better lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation and an 
      improved image quality on T1w compared to STIR imaging at both field strengths (p 
      < 0.05) with similar results for T1w at 1.5 T and 3 T, but inferior results for 
      STIR especially at 3 T. CONCLUSION: The whole-body MRI protocol for the detection 
      of bone metastases could safely be limited to the T1w sequence in adults, 
      especially at 3 T. There is no need for an additional STIR sequence. These 
      initial results will have a major impact on the department's workflow if 
      confirmed by larger studies as they will help reduce examination time and 
      therefore save financial resources. KEY POINTS: In a routine MR protocol, T1w 
      imaging is sufficient for the detection of bone metastases. In case of 
      differential diagnostic problems, other appropriate sequences can be added to the 
      protocol. STIR is inferior to T1w in the detection of metastases, especially at 3 
      T.
