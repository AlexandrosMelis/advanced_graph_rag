TI  - Utility of unenhanced fat-suppressed T1-weighted MRI in children with sickle cell 
      disease -- can it differentiate bone infarcts from acute osteomyelitis?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk of bone infarcts 
      and acute osteomyelitis. The clinical differentiation between a bone infarct and 
      acute osteomyelitis is a diagnostic challenge. Unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MR 
      images have been proposed as a potential tool to differentiate bone infarcts from 
      osteomyelitis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the reliability of unenhanced T1-W 
      fat-saturated MRI for differentiation between bone infarcts and acute 
      osteomyelitis in children with SCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively 
      reviewed the records of 31 children (20 boys, 11 girls; mean age 10.6 years, 
      range 1.1-17.9 years) with SCD and acute bone pain who underwent MR imaging 
      including unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated images from 2005 to 2010. Complete 
      clinical charts were reviewed by a pediatric hematologist with training in 
      infectious diseases to determine a clinical standard to define the presence or 
      absence of osteomyelitis. A pediatric radiologist reviewed all MR imaging and was 
      blinded to clinical information. Based on the signal intensity in T1-W 
      fat-saturated images, the children were further classified as positive for 
      osteomyelitis (low bone marrow signal intensity) or positive for bone infarct 
      (high bone marrow signal intensity). RESULTS: Based on the clinical standard, 5 
      children were classified as positive for osteomyelitis and 26 children as 
      positive for bone infarct (negative for osteomyelitis). The bone marrow signal 
      intensity on T1-W fat-saturated imaging was not significant for the 
      differentiation between bone infarct and osteomyelitis (P = 0.56). None of the 
      additional evaluated imaging parameters on unenhanced MRI proved reliable in 
      differentiating these diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The bone marrow signal intensity on 
      unenhanced T1-W fat-saturated MR images is not a reliable criterion to 
      differentiate bone infarcts from osteomyelitis in children.
