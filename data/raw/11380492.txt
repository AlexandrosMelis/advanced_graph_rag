TI  - Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: can we predict outcome?
PG  - 617-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the results of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients 
      with Cushing's disease over a period of 18 years, and to determine if there are 
      factors which will predict the outcome. PATIENTS: Sixty-nine sequential patients 
      treated surgically by a single surgeon in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1980 and 
      1997 were identified and data from 61 of these have been analysed. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective analysis of outcome measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients were 
      divided into three groups (remission, failure and relapse) depending on the late 
      outcome of their treatment as determined at the time of analysis, i.e. 88 months 
      (median) years after surgery. Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of 
      hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of 
      clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. 
      Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as 
      the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. 
      Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine 
      disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and 
      postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, 
      histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three 
      groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse 
      after treatment. RESULTS: Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) 
      achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients 
      suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after 
      apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission 
      group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved 
      remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified 
      achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both 
      radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving 
      remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 
      0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups 
      when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, 
      respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) 
      were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical 
      treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included 
      transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and 
      cacosmia in 3. Twelve of 41 patients required some form of hormonal replacement 
      therapy despite achieving long-term remission. Thirteen patients underwent a 
      second operation, of whom 5 achieved remission. CONCLUSIONS: Transsphenoidal 
      pituitary surgery is a safe method of treatment in patients with Cushing's 
      disease. Operative findings, radiological and histological findings, together 
      with early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol estimates may 
      identify failures in treatment. Alternative treatment might then be required for 
      these patients. Because of the risk of late relapse, patients require life-long 
      follow-up.
