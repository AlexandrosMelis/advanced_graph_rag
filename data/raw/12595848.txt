TI  - Is specialty care associated with improved survival of patients with congestive 
      heart failure?
PG  - 300-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementation of the complex treatment strategies that have been 
      shown to improve survival of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) may 
      require certain expertise. We wanted to examine the association between pattern 
      of outpatient care and survival of patients with CHF. METHODS: In a retrospective 
      cohort study conducted with national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
      databases, we examined the association between the pattern of outpatient care and 
      survival in 11,661 patients discharged from VA hospitals between October 1, 1991, 
      and September 30, 1992, with the primary diagnosis of CHF (cohort 1). Patients 
      were divided into 4 groups, on the basis of their pattern of outpatient care over 
      a 12-month period after discharge: 1) general medicine clinic visits only 
      (GM-only); 2) cardiology clinic visits only (CARD-only); 3) general medicine and 
      cardiology (MIXED) clinic visits; and 4) neither general medicine nor cardiology 
      clinic visits (no-GM/CARD). We used the Cox proportional hazards model to 
      evaluate 1-year survival, controlling for clinical and demographic factors. 
      Consistency of our results was examined by performing identical analysis on a 
      cohort of patients discharged from VHA hospitals between October 1, 1994, and 
      September 30, 1995 (cohort 2, n = 10,141). RESULTS: The overall 1-year mortality 
      rate was 23% in the primary cohort. The unadjusted mortality rate was highest for 
      patients in the no-GM/CARD follow up (29%) and lowest for patients in the MIXED 
      group (19%). By use of the MIXED group as reference and adjusting for important 
      clinical and demographic factors, the risk of death (risk ratio [95% CI]) was 
      1.12 (0.94-1.34) in the CARD-only group, 1.26 (1.15-1.38) in the GM-only group, 
      and 1.48 (1.28-1.72) in the no-GM/CARD group. Cohort-2 results were consistent 
      with cohort 1 for most covariates, and significant survival differences were 
      again found between GM-only and the MIXED group (1.25 [1.14-1.37]). CONCLUSIONS: 
      We found an improved survival associated with cardiologist care and a mixture of 
      general practitioner and cardiologist care compared with general practitioner 
      care. The pattern of outpatient care may therefore be important for the survival 
      of patients with CHF.
