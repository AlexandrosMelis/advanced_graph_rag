AB  - BACKGROUND: Concussions are commonly diagnosed in pediatric patients presenting 
      to the emergency department (ED). The primary objective of this study was to 
      evaluate compliance with ED discharge instructions for concussion management. 
      METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2011 to November 
      2012 in a pediatric ED at a regional Level 1 trauma center, serving 35,000 
      pediatric patients per year. Subjects were aged 8 years to 17 years and were 
      discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of concussion. Exclusion criteria 
      included recent (past 3 months) diagnosis of head injury, hospital admission, 
      intracranial injury, skull fracture, suspected nonaccidental trauma, or 
      preexisting neurologic condition. Subjects were administered a baseline survey in 
      the ED and were given standardized discharge instructions for concussion by the 
      treating physician. Telephone follow-up surveys were conducted at 2 weeks and 4 
      weeks after ED visit. RESULTS: A total of 150 patients were enrolled. The 
      majority (67%) of concussions were sports related. Among sports-related 
      concussions, soccer (30%), football (11%), lacrosse (8%), and basketball (8%) 
      injuries were most common. More than one third (39%) reported return to play 
      (RTP) on the day of the injury. Physician follow-up was equivalent for sport and 
      nonsport concussions (2 weeks, 58%; 4 weeks, 64%). Sports-related concussion 
      patients were more likely to follow up with a trainer (2 weeks, 25% vs. 10%, p = 
      0.06; 4 weeks, 29% vs. 8%, p < 0.01). Of the patients who did RTP or normal 
      activities at 2 weeks (44%), more than one third (35%) were symptomatic, and most 
      (58%) did not receive medical clearance. Of the patients who had returned to 
      activities at 4 weeks (64%), less than one quarter (23%) were symptomatic, and 
      most (54%) received medical clearance. CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients discharged 
      from the ED are mostly compliant with concussion instructions. However, a 
      significant number of patients RTP on the day of injury, while experiencing 
      symptoms or without medical clearance. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Care management, level 
      IV. Epidemiologic study, level III.
