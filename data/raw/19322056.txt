      weight infants?

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Controversy exists regarding the optimal enteral 
      feeding regimen of very low birth weight infants (VLBW). Rapid advancement of 
      enteral feeding has been associated with an increased rate of necrotizing 
      enterocolitis. In contrast, delaying enteral feeding may have unfavorable effects 
      on nutrition, growth, and neurodevelopment. The aim is to compare the short-term 
      outcomes of VLBW infants in tertiary care centers according to their enteral 
      feeding advancement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied the influence 
      of center-specific enteral feeding advancement in 1430 VLBW infants recruited 
      from 13 tertiary neonatal intensive care units in Germany on short-term outcome 
      parameters. The centers were post hoc stratified to "rapid advancement to full 
      enteral feeds" (median duration of advancement to full enteral feeds < or =12.5 
      days; 6 centers), that is, rapid advancement (RA), or "slow advancement to full 
      enteral feeds" (median duration of advancement to full enteral feeds >12.5 days; 
      7 centers), that is, slow advancement (SA). RESULTS: VLBW infants born in centers 
      with SA (n = 713) had a significantly higher rate of sepsis compared with VLBW 
      infants born in centers with RA (n = 717), which was particularly evident for 
      late-onset sepsis (14.0% vs 20.4%; P = 0.002). Furthermore, more central venous 
      lines (48.6% vs 31.1%, P < 0.001) and antibiotics (92.4% vs 77.7%, P < 0.001) 
      were used in centers with SA. CONCLUSIONS: Center differences in enteral feeding 
      advancement occur and may have a significant impact on short-term outcomes such 
      as nosocomial sepsis. Large, multicenter, prospective trials are required to 
      further elucidate the optimal feeding strategy for VLBW infants.
