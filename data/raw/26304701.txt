AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of preoperative education on anxiety and postoperative 
      outcomes of cardiac surgery patients remains unclear. AIM: The aim of the study 
      was to estimate the effectiveness of a nurse-led preoperative education on 
      anxiety and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: A randomised controlled study was 
      designed. All the patients who were admitted for elective cardiac surgery in a 
      general hospital in Athens with knowledge of the Greek language were eligible to 
      take part in the study. Patients in the intervention group received preoperative 
      education by specially trained nurses. The control group received the standard 
      information by the ward personnel. Measurements of anxiety were conducted on 
      admission-A, before surgery-B and before discharge-C by the state-trait anxiety 
      inventory. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 395 patients (intervention group: 
      205, control group: 190). The state anxiety on the day before surgery decreased 
      only in the intervention group (34.0 (8.4) versus 36.9 (10.7); P=0.001). The mean 
      decrease in state score during the follow-up period was greater in the 
      intervention group (P=0.001). No significant difference was found in the length 
      of stay or readmission. Lower proportions of chest infection were found in the 
      intervention group (10 (5.3) versus 1 (0.5); P=0.004). Multivariate linear 
      regression revealed that education and score in trait anxiety scale on admission 
      are independent predictors of a reduction in state anxiety. CONCLUSION: 
      Preoperative education delivered by nurses reduced anxiety and postoperative 
      complications of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, but it was not effective in 
      reducing readmissions or length of stay.
