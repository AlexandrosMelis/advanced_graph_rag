AB  - BACKGROUND: Orthodontic patients show high prevalence of tooth-size discrepancy. 
      This study investigates the possible association between arch form, clinically 
      significant tooth-size discrepancy, and sagittal molar relationship. METHODS: 
      Pretreatment orthodontic casts of 230 Saudi patients were classified into one of 
      three arch form types (tapered, ovoid, and square) using digitally scanned images 
      of the mandibular arches. Bolton ratio was calculated, sagittal molar 
      relationship was defined according to Angle classification, and correlations were 
      analyzed using ANOVA, chi-square, and t-tests. RESULTS: No single arch form was 
      significantly more common than the others. Furthermore, no association was 
      observed between the presence of significant Bolton discrepancy and the sagittal 
      molar relationship or arch form. Overall Bolton discrepancy is significantly more 
      prevalent in males. CONCLUSIONS: Arch form in a Saudi patient group is 
      independent of gender, sagittal molar relationship, and Bolton discrepancy.
