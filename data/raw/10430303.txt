AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To investigate the influence of laparoscopic procedures on 
      perisinusoidal cell function. METHODOLOGY: In 31 patients who underwent 
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis, the serum levels of 
      beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were measured. 
      Six female patients, who underwent other laparoscopic procedures, not involving 
      the hepatobiliary system, served as controls. RESULTS: HA serum levels increased 
      significantly in both study and control groups, while beta-NAH serum levels 
      remained within normal values. Post-operative AST and ALT serum levels increased 
      significantly only in the study group. No elevation of serum ALP was noted in any 
      of our patients, and post-operative bilirubin levels did not increase in patients 
      with normal pre-operative levels. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic procedures caused 
      detectable damage to Kupffer and endothelial cells as reflected by elevation of 
      post-operative HA serum levels. The damage to the liver hepatocytes and 
      perisinusoidal cells has no clinical significance and the laparoscopic procedure 
      itself is the probable cause of the Kupffer and endothelial cells damage, while 
      other mechanisms caused damage to the hepatocytes.
