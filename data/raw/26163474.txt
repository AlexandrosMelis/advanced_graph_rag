AB  - BACKGROUND: Sublingual varices have earlier been related to ageing, smoking and 
      cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to investigate whether 
      sublingual varices are related to presence of hypertension. METHODS: In an 
      observational clinical study among 431 dental patients tongue status and blood 
      pressure were documented. Digital photographs of the lateral borders of the 
      tongue for grading of sublingual varices were taken, and blood pressure was 
      measured. Those patients without previous diagnosis of hypertension and with a 
      noted blood pressure >/= 140 mmHg and/or >/= 90 mmHg at the dental clinic performed 
      complementary home blood pressure during one week. Those with an average home 
      blood pressure >/= 135 mmHg and/or >/= 85 mmHg were referred to the primary health 
      care centre, where three office blood pressure measurements were taken with one 
      week intervals. Two independent blinded observers studied the photographs of the 
      tongues. Each photograph was graded as none/few (grade 0) or medium/severe (grade 
      1) presence of sublingual varices. Pearson's Chi-square test, Student's t-test, 
      and multiple regression analysis were applied. Power calculation stipulated a 
      study population of 323 patients. RESULTS: An association between sublingual 
      varices and hypertension was found (OR = 2.25, p < 0.002). Mean systolic blood 
      pressure was 123 and 132 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual 
      varices, respectively (p < 0.0001, CI 95 %). Mean diastolic blood pressure was 80 
      and 83 mmHg in patients with grade 0 and grade 1 sublingual varices, respectively 
      (p < 0.005, CI 95 %). Sublingual varices indicate hypertension with a positive 
      predictive value of 0.5 and a negative predictive value of 0.80. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      association was found between sublingual varices and hypertension. Examining the 
      lateral borders of the tongue is easily done, causes no harm and could be a 
      valuable method for the dental profession to take active part in preventive 
      healthcare.
