TI  - Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well 
      differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer?
PG  - 923-30
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not well 
      differentiated (w-d) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is indeed clinically early 
      cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy six patients with solitary small HCCs up 
      to 3 cm in diameter, who underwent hepatectomy, were observed for at least 2 
      years for possible recurrence. These patients were divided into two groups: 10 
      patients with w-d HCCs (Edmondson and Steiner's grade I) and 66 patients with 
      less differentiated (l-d) HCCs (Edmondson and Steiner's grade I-II, II-III, and 
      III). RESULTS: The histological analysis revealed that w-d HCCs had lower 
      incidences of fibrous capsule formation (P<0.01), when compared to l-d HCCs. 
      There were no significant differences in the incidence of intrahepatic 
      metastasis, or portal vein invasion. In a resected specimen of w-d HCC, barium 
      sulfate and gelatin were injected into portal vein and a transparent specimen was 
      made. The transparent specimen showed that the portal vein in the tumor seemed to 
      be intact. Microscopically, cancer cell infiltration into the fibrous frame of 
      the portal tract was present. There were no significant differences in the 
      disease free survival between the two groups. An analysis of tumor volume 
      doubling time in recurrent foci suggested that minute cancerous foci had been 
      present at the time of operation. CONCLUSIONS: W-d HCCs were clinically 
      demonstrated not to be early cancer, because there was no significant difference 
      in disease free survival between the patients with w-d and l-d HCCs.
