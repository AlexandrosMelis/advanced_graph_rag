AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to evaluate pre-treatment concentrations of 
      leptin in patients with advanced lung cancer and to investigate possible 
      associations between their levels and clinicopathological variables, response to 
      therapy and overall survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There are 71 previously 
      untreated patients with cytological or histological evidence of primary lung 
      cancer who were admitted to the oncology department between November 2013 and 
      August 2014. Forty-five healthy individuals with age, sex and BMI matching the 
      lung cancer patients, were recruited to take part in the study as a control 
      group. Leptin levels were measured quantitatively by using a microELISA kit. 
      RESULTS: The serum leptin levels at diagnosis were significantly lower in lung 
      cancer patients than those in control subjects (4.75+/-4.91 ng/ml, 9.67+/-8.02 ng/ml; 
      p<0.001). We did not find any significant difference in leptin values related to 
      clinicopathological parameters such as ECOG PS, weight loss, histological type, 
      disease stage and TNM classification. Nevertheless, we demonstrated a significant 
      correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients 
      (correlation coefficient: 0.303; p>0.010). The analysis of serum leptin values 
      did not show any association with the overall survival of the patients. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the serum leptin level has no prognostic 
      indications in advanced lung cancer patients. Leptin is decreased in lung cancer, 
      and there is lack of correlation with tumourâ€‘related factors including prognosis. 
      Therefore, leptin is not a useful clinical marker in lung cancer (Tab. 2, Fig. 2, 
      Ref. 22).
