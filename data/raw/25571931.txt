AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among patients with acute stroke symptoms, delay in 
      hospital admission is the main obstacle for the use of thrombolytic therapy and 
      other interventions associated with decreased mortality and disability. The 
      primary aim of this study was to assess whether an elderly clinical population 
      correctly endorsed the response to call for emergency services when presented 
      with signs and symptoms of stroke using a standardized questionnaire. METHODS: We 
      performed a cross-sectional study among elderly out-patients (>/=60 years) in 
      Buenos Aires, Argentina randomly recruited from a government funded health 
      clinic. The correct endorsement of intention to call 911 was assessed with the 
      Stroke Action Test and the cut-off point was set at >/=75%. Knowledge of stroke and 
      clinical and socio-demographic indicators were also collected and evaluated as 
      predictors of correct endorsement using logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 367 
      elderly adults, 14% correctly endorsed intention to call 911. Presented with the 
      most typical signs and symptoms, only 65% reported that they would call an 
      ambulance. Amaurosis Fugax was the symptom for which was called the least (15%). 
      On average, the correct response was chosen only 37% of the time. Compared to 
      lower levels of education, higher levels were associated to correctly endorsed 
      intention to call 911 (secondary School adjusted OR 3.53, 95% CI 1.59-7.86 and 
      Tertiary/University adjusted OR 3.04, 95% CI 1.12-8.21). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest the need to provide interventions that are specifically designed 
      to increase awareness of potential stroke signs and symptoms and appropriate 
      subsequent clinical actions.
