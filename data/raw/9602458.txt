TI  - Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral 
      palsy?
PG  - 102-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper assesses the usefulness of the Child Health Computing 
      System as a source of information about children with cerebral palsy. METHODS: A 
      comparative survey of information held on the Child Health Computing System 
      (CHCS) and the Northern Ireland Cerebral Palsy Register (NICPR) in one Health and 
      Social Services Board in Northern Ireland was carried out. The sample comprised 
      children with cerebral palsy aged 5-9 years. RESULTS: Of the 135 cases recorded 
      on the NICPR, 47 per cent were not found on the CHCS; the majority of these 
      children had no computer record of any medical diagnosis. Of the 82 cases 
      recorded on the CHCS, 10 (12 per cent) were not found on the NICPR; five of these 
      cases (6 per cent) were found on follow-up not to have CP. CONCLUSIONS: Unless 
      improvements are made in case ascertainment, case validation and recording 
      activities, the evidence suggests that the CHCS will not be able to provide the 
      same quality of information for needs assessment and surveillance of very low 
      birthweight infants in relation to cerebral palsy as is provided by a specialist 
      case register.
