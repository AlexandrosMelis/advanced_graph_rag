      subarachnoid hemorrhage?

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the advancement of an aging society in the world, an increasing 
      number of elderly patients have been hospitalized due to aneurysmal subarachnoid 
      hemorrhage (aSAH). There is no study that compares the elderly cases of aSAH who 
      receive the definitive treatment with those who treated conservatively. The aim 
      of this study was to investigate the feasibility of the definitive surgery for 
      the acute subarachnoid cases aged 80 or older. METHODS: We reviewed 500 
      consecutive cases with acute aSAH with surgical indication for aneurysm repair. 
      Inoperable cases such as dead-on-arrival and the cases with both pupils dilated 
      were excluded. We compared the cases aged 80 or older that received clipping or 
      coil embolization with the controls that the family selected conservative 
      treatment. RESULTS: 69 cases were included in this study (ranged 80-98, 
      male:female=9:60). 56 cases (81.2%) had an aneurysm in the anterior circulation. 
      23 cases received clipping, 20 cases coil embolization and 26 cases treated 
      conservatively. The cases with aneurysm repair showed significantly better 
      clinical outcome than the controls, while World Federation of Neurological 
      Surgeons (WFNS) grade on admission and premorbid modified Rankin Scale showed no 
      difference between them. CONCLUSIONS: Better prognosis was obtained when ruptured 
      aneurysm was repaired in the elderly than it was treated conservatively. From the 
      results of this study, we should not hesitate to offer the definitive surgery for 
      the elderly with aSAH.
