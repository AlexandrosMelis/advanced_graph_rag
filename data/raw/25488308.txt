AB  - PURPOSE: The proper angle of miniscrew insertion is important for cortical 
      anchorage, patient safety, and biomechanical control. The purposes of this study 
      are to report the alveolar process thickness and inter-radicular space in the 
      posterior region of the mandible, to assess the impact of different miniscrew 
      insertion angle protocols, and to identify differences between the genders or 
      types of malocclusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 100 
      individuals were selected for orthodontic treatment at a radiology clinic. 
      Cone-beam computed tomography data were imported into 3-dimensional software. The 
      predictor variable was the location in the mandible and insertion angle. The 
      demographic variables collected included age, gender, and malocclusion (Angle 
      Classes I and II). The primary outcome variables were bone thickness and 
      inter-radicular space. The inter-radicular spaces were evaluated 5 mm from the 
      cement-enamel junction. The bone thicknesses were taken at 45 degrees , 60 degrees , and 90 degrees  in 
      relation to the alveolar ridge, simulating a miniscrew insertion. These factors 
      were evaluated for sexual dimorphism and malocclusion (Angle Classes I and II). 
      Sexual dimorphism and malocclusion were evaluated with t tests. To compare the 
      inter-radicular space and the thickness of bone between areas, an analysis of 
      variance for repeated measures was used. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 100 
      patients with a mean age of 17.4 +/- 6.74 years. There were 61 female and 39 male 
      patients and 60 Class I and 40 Class II molar relationships. The inter-radicular 
      space ranged from 2.46 to 3.31 mm, and alveolar bone thickness ranged from 8.01 
      to 13.77 mm. The thickness tended to decrease with the increase in insertion 
      angle from 45 degrees  to 90 degrees . No significant differences between the genders or types of 
      malocclusion were found. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the 
      safest areas for the placement of miniscrews are between the first and second 
      premolars and between the first and second molars, regardless of the angle of 
      insertion.
