      disease?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are various causes of halitosis, one of which is chronic renal 
      failure. The objective of this study was to investigate halitosis levels in 
      end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients before and after peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      therapy. METHODS: 42 subjects with ESRD were included in this study. The presence 
      of halitosis was assessed using an organoleptic measurement and compared with 
      blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and salivary flow rates. Decayed, missing, and 
      filled teeth (DMFT) index and Community Periodontal Index (CPI) were calculated. 
      All measurements were done before and after patients had received 3 months of PD 
      therapy. RESULTS: Mean serum BUN level was found to be lower (46.05 +/- 13.30 vs 
      91.24 +/- 31.28 mg/dL), salivary flow rate higher (0.34 +/- 0.07 vs 0.26 +/- 0.04 
      mL/minute), and halitosis level lower (2.39 +/- 0.60 vs 3.90 +/- 0.37) at the end of 
      3 months of PD therapy than at the beginning of PD therapy. There was no 
      significant difference in CPI or DMFT index before and after PD therapy (p > 
      0.05). There was statistically significant positive correlation between the 
      presence of halitosis and BUN levels (r = 0.702, p = 0.001 before PD; r = 0.45, p 
      = 0.002 after PD) and a negative correlation between the presence of halitosis 
      and salivary flow rates (r = -0.69, p = 0.000 before PD; r = -0.37, p = 0.01 
      after PD). CONCLUSION: High BUN levels and low salivary flow rates were found to 
      be associated with halitosis. PD may play an important role in decreasing the 
      level of halitosis in ESRD patients.
