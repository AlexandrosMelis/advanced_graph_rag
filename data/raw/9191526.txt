TI  - Multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics. Do they work?
PG  - 2380-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: In an attempt to improve the care they provide for their patients 
      with breast cancer, the authors' institution developed a multidisciplinary breast 
      cancer clinic (MDBCC) to offer "one-stop shopping" consultation and support for 
      newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. METHODS: One hundred sixty-two patients, 
      the control group for this study, were evaluated at Henry Ford Hospital during 
      the year prior to the opening of the MDBCC. These patients, who were referred in 
      the traditional sequential consultation manner, were compared with the first 177 
      patients seen during the first year of the clinic's operation. Retrospective 
      chart reviews were conducted to assess treatment timeliness, and anonymous 
      questionnaires were used to assess patient satisfaction. RESULTS: The authors 
      found that the MDBCC increased patient satisfaction by encouraging involvement of 
      patients' families and friends and by helping patients make treatment decisions 
      (P < 0.001). The time between diagnosis and the initiation of treatment was also 
      significantly decreased (42.2 days vs. 29.6 days; P < 0.0008). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Although planning and operating a multidisciplinary clinic is not a new venture, 
      to the best of the authors' knowledge, they have provided the first report 
      demonstrating the benefits described above.
