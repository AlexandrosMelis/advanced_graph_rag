AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors examined equivalence of wandering and physically 
      nonaggressive agitation (PNA) as concepts. DESIGN: A cross-sectional 
      correlational design was used. SETTING: Participants were recruited from 22 
      nursing homes and 6 assisted living facilities in two states. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Ambulatory residents meeting DSM-IV criteria for dementia (N = 181) were studied. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Video-tapes for up to twelve 20-minute observations per participant 
      were coded for wandering using an empirically derived taxonomy of ambulation 
      patterns. Separate raters coded the same tapes for six PNA behaviors on the 
      agitation behavior mapping instrument. RESULTS: Most participants (73.5%) 
      wandered; all showed PNA behaviors. Factor analyses yielded an one-factor 
      solution for wandering (explained variance = 43.66%) and a two-factor solution 
      for PNA (explained variance = 53.45%). Overall wandering correlated significantly 
      with PNA Factor 1 (df =179, r = 0.68, p <0.001) and Factor 2, but at a lower 
      value (df = 179, r = 0.26, p <0.01). CONCLUSION: Findings depict wandering and 
      PNA as overlapping, but nonequivalent phenomena. Evidence supporting construct 
      validity of wandering was more robust than that for PNA. Results have 
      implications for accuracy in scientific and clinical detection and labeling of 
      wandering and agitation.
