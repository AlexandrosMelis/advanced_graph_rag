TI  - Does quilting suture prevent seroma in abdominoplasty?
PG  - 1060-4; discussion 1065-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Seroma is the most frequent complication in abdominoplasty. Some 
      patients are more prone to develop this complication. Ultrasound is a well-known 
      method with which to diagnose seroma in the abdominal wall. The purpose of this 
      study was to verify the efficacy of the use of quilting suture to prevent seroma. 
      METHODS: Twenty-one female patients who presented with abdominal deformity type 
      III/A according to the authors' classification of abdominal skin and 
      myoaponeurotic deformity had undergone abdominoplasty. The selected patients 
      should have had at least one of the following characteristics: body mass index 
      greater than 25 kg/m; weight loss greater than 10 kg; previous incision in the 
      supraumbilical region; or present thinning of the subcutaneous in the area above 
      the umbilicus. Ultrasound was performed for every patient from 15 to 18 days 
      after the operation to search for fluid collection in the abdominal wall. 
      RESULTS: The average fluid collection found was 8.2 cc per patient. Only two 
      patients underwent aspiration because ultrasound showed greater than 20 cc 
      collected above the fascial layer. These patients did not present with recurrence 
      of seroma after aspiration. CONCLUSION: The quilting suture seems to be an 
      efficient technique with which to prevent seroma formation.
