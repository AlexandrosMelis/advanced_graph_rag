AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Academic medical researchers are judged by how often their 
      publications are cited in the literature. When serving as journal reviewers, they 
      may be more favorably disposed to manuscripts that cite their work. We 
      investigate whether manuscripts that contain a citation to the reviewer's work 
      receive higher evaluations than those that do not and whether peer reviewers 
      encourage authors to cite that reviewer's work. METHODS: We analyzed all research 
      manuscripts submitted in 2012 to Annals of Emergency Medicine to determine 
      whether they contained citations to each reviewer's work. To determine whether 
      citation affected reviewer scores, we obtained each reviewer's score of the 
      manuscript's overall desirability (1=worst to 5=best) and used descriptive 
      statistics and regression modeling to compare scores of cited and noncited 
      reviewers. We also enumerated how often reviewers suggested that authors add 
      citations to the reviewer's work or other work. RESULTS: There were 395 
      manuscripts and 999 corresponding reviews with an manuscript desirability score. 
      The 83 reviews by cited reviewers (8.3%) had a mean score of 2.8 (SD 1.4); the 
      916 reviews by noncited reviewers (91.7%), 2.5 (1.2; Delta=0.3; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] 0 to 0.6). The mean score in the 117 reviews of the noncited 
      reviewers of the 57 manuscripts that had both cited and noncited reviewers was 
      2.9 (SD 1.2) compared with 2.9 (SD 1.1) for the 68 reviews by cited reviewers 
      (Delta=0; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.4). In the final ordinal regression model, the unadjusted 
      OR for the manuscript desirability score was 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.7); when 
      adjusting for the manuscripts' mean desirability score, it was 1.4 (95% CI 0.8 
      to 2.2), demonstrating that manuscript quality was a confounder. Authors were 
      asked to add a citation to the reviewer's work in 28 reviews (3%) but to others' 
      work in 98 (10%). CONCLUSION: In a leading specialty journal, cited reviewers 
      gave higher scores than noncited reviewers. However, this was likely due to their 
      being assigned higher-quality manuscripts and not because they were cited in the 
      manuscript. Reviewer requests that their work be cited were rare.
