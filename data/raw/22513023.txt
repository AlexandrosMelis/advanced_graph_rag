      and health conditions of older Indigenous people for health and aged care policy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether Indigenous Australians age prematurely compared with 
      other Australians, as implied by Australian Government aged care policy, which 
      uses age 50 years and over for population-based planning for Indigenous people 
      compared with 70 years for non-indigenous people. METHODS: Cross-sectional 
      analysis of aged care assessment, hospital and health survey data comparing 
      Indigenous and non-indigenous age-specific prevalence of health conditions. 
      Analysis of life tables for Indigenous and non-indigenous populations comparing 
      life expectancy at different ages. RESULTS: At age 63 for women and age 65 for 
      men, Indigenous people had the same life expectancy as non-indigenous people at 
      age 70. There is no consistent pattern of a 20-year lead in age-specific 
      prevalence of age-associated conditions for Indigenous compared with other 
      Australians. There is high prevalence from middle-age onwards of some conditions, 
      particularly diabetes (type unspecified), but there is little or no lead for 
      others. CONCLUSION: The idea that Indigenous people age prematurely is not well 
      supported by this study of a series of discrete conditions. The current focus and 
      type of services provided by the aged care sector may not be the best way to 
      respond to the excessive burden of chronic disease and disability of middle-aged 
      Indigenous people.
