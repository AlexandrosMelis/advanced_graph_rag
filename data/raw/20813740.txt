      eyelid?

AB  - AIM: Expression of beta-catenin in sebaceous cell carcinoma (SbCC) of the eyelid and 
      its correlation with histopathological features. METHOD: 48 cases of SbCC were 
      analysed immunohistochemically using monoclonal beta-catenin antibody and the 
      results correlated with tumour size, histopathological differentiation, orbital 
      invasion and pagetoid spread. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic overexpression of beta-catenin 
      was seen in 66% cases of SbCC which correlated positively with tumour size, 
      orbital invasion and pagetoid spread. This correlation was found to be 
      significant in tumour size > 2 cm (p = 0.242). Nuclear staining was not observed 
      in any of the cases. CONCLUSION: Cytoplasmic overexpression of beta-catenin was 
      observed in the majority of the cases of SbCC of eyelid, and this correlated 
      significantly with tumour size. The authors therefore hypothesise that beta-catenin 
      overexpression in SbCC of eyelid may be a result of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway 
      dysregulation. However, its role both in the development of sebaceous cell 
      carcinoma of the eyelid as well as its prognosis needs to be explored further.
