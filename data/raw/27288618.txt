AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether prophylactic inhaled heparin is effective for the 
      prevention and treatment of pneumonia patients receiving mechanical ventilation 
      (MV) in the intensive care unit. METHODS: A phase 2, double blind randomized 
      controlled trial stratified for study center and patient type (non-operative, 
      post-operative) was conducted in three university-affiliated intensive care 
      units. Patients aged >/=18years and requiring invasive MV for more than 48hours 
      were randomized to usual care, nebulization of unfractionated sodium heparin 
      (5000 units in 2mL) or placebo nebulization with 0.9% sodium chloride (2mL) four 
      times daily with the main outcome measures of the development of ventilator 
      associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator associated complication (VAC) and 
      sequential organ failure assessment scores in patients with pneumonia on 
      admission or who developed VAP. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand 
      Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12612000038897. RESULTS: Two hundred and fourteen 
      patients were enrolled (72 usual care, 71 inhaled sodium heparin, 71 inhaled 
      sodium chloride). There were no differences between treatment groups in terms of 
      the development of VAP, using either Klompas criteria (6-7%, P=1.00) or clinical 
      diagnosis (24-26%, P=0.85). There was no difference in the clinical consistency 
      (P=0.70), number (P=0.28) or the total volume of secretions per day (P=.54). The 
      presence of blood in secretions was significantly less in the usual care group 
      (P=0.005). CONCLUSION: Nebulized heparin cannot be recommended for prophylaxis 
      against VAP or to hasten recovery from pneumonia in patients receiving MV.
