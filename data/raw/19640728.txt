      prostheses: is single-valve replacement safe?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bias against operating on patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis 
      (PVE) who have multiple prostheses may preclude the use of life-saving valve 
      replacement. We investigated the accuracy of the preoperative diagnosis of PVE in 
      patients with both mitral and aortic prosthesis and the safety of single-valve 
      replacement when only one valve seemed infected. METHODS: Patients with a 
      diagnosis of active PVE who had mitral and aortic prosthesis in place were 
      assessed. We looked at the methods for diagnosis, causative agents, indication 
      for valve replacement, operative findings and outcome. RESULTS: Twenty patients, 
      who had both mitral and aortic prostheses and a diagnosis of PVE, were assessed. 
      Streptococci and staphylococci caused 70% of cases. By means of echocardiography, 
      the valves involved were: mitral (11 patients), aortic (six patients), and in 
      three cases both prosthetic valves seemed infected. Surgery was undertaken in 17 
      patients (85%). The positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram 
      (TEE) for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection was 100%. In 13 
      patients, only the prosthetic valve that seemed infected was replaced. Four of 
      these patients died within a week after the procedure. Nine patients survived the 
      surgical procedure, completed a course of antimicrobial therapy and were followed 
      up for 15.78 months (95% CI: 12.83-18.72). All were considered cured and relapses 
      were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: TEE allowed a diagnosis of site involvement that 
      did correlate with the anatomic diagnosis obtained during the operation. This 
      fact contributed to the management of patients and was of great help in guiding 
      the surgical intervention. Echo-oriented single-valve replacement may be a safe 
      strategy for patients with PVE and double prostheses.
