TI  - Can folic acid protect against congenital heart defects in Down syndrome?
PG  - 714-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested a protective effect of folic acid (FA) 
      on congenital heart anomalies. Down syndrome (DS) infants are known to have a 
      high frequency of heart anomalies. Not all children with DS suffer from heart 
      anomalies, which raises the question whether maternal factors might affect the 
      risk of these anomalies. Our objectives were to investigate whether 
      first-trimester FA use protects against heart anomalies among DS children. 
      METHODS: Women with liveborn DS children participating in the Slone Epidemiology 
      Center Birth Defects Study between 1976 and 1997 were included. We performed 
      case-control analyses using DS, with heart anomalies as cases and DS, without 
      heart anomalies as controls. Subanalyses were performed for defects that have 
      been associated with FA in non-DS populations (conotruncal, ventricular septal 
      [VSD]) and for those that are associated with DS (ostium secundum type atrial 
      septal defects [ASD] and endocardial cushion defects [ECD]). Exposure was defined 
      as the use of any FA-containing product for an average of at least 4 days per 
      week during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, whereas no exposure was defined as 
      no use of FA in these 12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 223 cases, 110 (49%) were exposed 
      versus 84 (46%) of the 184 controls. After adjustment for possible confounders, 
      no protective effect of FA was found on heart anomalies overall (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 
      0.61-1.47) nor separately for conotruncal defects, VSDs, ASDs, or ECDs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our study does not show a protective effect of FA on heart anomalies 
      among infants with DS.
