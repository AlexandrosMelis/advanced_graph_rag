TI  - Cutaneous melanoma in a multiethnic population: is this a different disease?
PG  - 968-72; discussion 972-73
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Cutaneous melanoma in nonwhite persons has a manifestation and a 
      prognosis that are different than those of cutaneous melanoma in white persons. 
      DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary care university-affiliated community 
      medical center located in a multiethnic state in which white persons are a 
      minority of the population. PATIENTS: Consecutive series of 357 patients with 
      melanoma seen between January 1994 and August 2003. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 
      Ethnicity, age, sex, primary site, tumor thickness, nodal status, stage at 
      diagnosis, and survival. RESULTS: There were 208 men and 149 women who ranged in 
      age from 15 to 93 years (mean, 58 years). Twenty-two patients initially had 
      unknown primary sites. Of these 357 patients, 67 (18.7%) were nonwhite. There was 
      no statistically significant difference in the age (P =.10) or sex (P =.57) 
      distribution of these 2 populations. Nonwhite patients at initial diagnosis had 
      thicker tumors (P =.002), more frequently had ulcerated primary tumors (P<.001), 
      more frequently had positive nodes (P =.004), and were at a more advanced stage 
      (P =.002) than their white counterparts. The anatomic distribution between the 2 
      populations was significantly different (P<.001), with a high incidence of 
      melanoma on the sole and subungual locations and a substantially less frequent 
      occurrence on the head and neck, trunk, and extremities in the nonwhite 
      population when compared with the white population. The overall survival rate of 
      the nonwhite patients was significantly worse than that of the white patients, 
      but when stratified by stage at initial diagnosis, there was no difference in 
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In a multiethnic population, cutaneous melanoma in nonwhite 
      persons is unusual but not rare. Although the diagnoses are distinctly different 
      at initial examinations, suggesting a potential biological component, 
      stage-for-stage outcomes are similar between white and nonwhite persons and 
      suggest a need for early diagnostic interventions with unusual pigmented lesions 
      in nonwhite persons.
