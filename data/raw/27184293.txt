AB  - INTRODUCTION: Microbial contamination can be a marker for faulty process and is 
      assumed to play an important role in the collection of hematopoietic progenitor 
      cell (HPC) and infusion procedure. We aimed to determine the microbial 
      contamination rates and evaluate the success of hematopoietic cell 
      transplantation (HCT) in patients who received contaminated products. 
      PATIENTS-METHODS: We analyzed microbial contamination records of HPC grafts 
      between 2012 and 2015, retrospectively. Contamination rates of autologous donors 
      were evaluated for at three steps: at the end of mobilization, following 
      processing with dimethyl sulfoxide, and just before stem cell infusion. Grafts of 
      allogeneic donors were assessed only before HCT. RESULT: A total of 445 
      mobilization procedures were carried out on 333 (167 autologous and 166 
      allogeneic) donors. The microbiological contamination of peripheral blood 
      (323/333 donations) and bone marrow (10/333 donations) products were analyzed. 
      Bacterial contamination was detected in 18 of 1552 (1.15 %) culture bottles of 
      333 donors. During the study period 248 patients underwent HCT and among these 
      patients microbial contamination rate on sample basis was 1.3 % (16/1212). 
      Microbial contamination detected in nine patients (7 autologous; 2 allogeneic). 
      In 8 of 9 patients, a febrile neutropenic attack was observed. The median day for 
      the neutropenic fever was 4 days (0-9). None of the patients died within the 
      post-transplant 30 days who received contaminated products. CONCLUSION: The use 
      of contaminated products with antibiotic prophylaxis may be safe in terms of the 
      first day of fever, duration of fever, neutrophil, platelet engraftment and 
      duration of hospitalization.
