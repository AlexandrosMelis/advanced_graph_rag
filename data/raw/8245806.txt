TI  - Does family practice at residency teaching sites reflect community practice?
PG  - 555-63
AB  - BACKGROUND: Family medicine has aspired to train residents and conduct research 
      in settings that closely resemble community practice. The purpose of this study 
      was to compare the patient characteristics of the ambulatory teaching centers of 
      a consortium of seven community-based university-affiliated family practice 
      residency programs in northeast Ohio with the National Ambulatory Medical Care 
      Survey (NAMCS) results for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners 
      (GPs). METHODS: Ninety-eight faculty and resident physicians at the residency 
      training site of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine collected 
      data on all ambulatory patient visits (N = 1498) for one randomly chosen week 
      between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992. We compared these data with patient 
      visits reported in the 1990 NAMCS for FPs and GPs. RESULTS: The residency 
      training sites saw slightly more children, women, blacks, and Medicare and 
      Medicaid patients. The most common reason for an office visit in both populations 
      was an undifferentiated symptom. Fifteen of the top 20 "reason for visit" codes 
      were identical, as were 14 of the top 20 diagnoses. More preventive and 
      therapeutic services were offered or performed at our residency training sites 
      but fewer diagnostic services were performed. There were fewer consultations 
      requested at our residency training sites but similar hospitalization rates for 
      patients. The mean duration of visit differed by only 1 minute. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      residency training sites of the Northeastern Ohio Universities College of 
      Medicine provide patient care opportunities similar to those found in a national 
      survey of family and general practitioners.
