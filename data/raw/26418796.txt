TI  - Do Wound Cultures Give Information About the Microbiology of Blood Cultures in 
      Severe Burn Patients?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood stream infection (BSI) and the subsequent development of sepsis 
      are among the most common infection complications occurring in severe burn 
      patients. This study was designed to evaluate the relationship between the burn 
      wound flora and BSI pathogens. METHODS: Documentation of all bacterial and fungal 
      wound and blood isolates from severe burn patients hospitalized in the burn unit 
      and intensive care unit was obtained from medical records retrieved 
      retrospectively from a computerized, hospital-wide database over a 13-year 
      period. All data were recorded in relation to the Ryan score. RESULTS: Of 195 
      severe burn patients, 88 had at least 1 BSI episode. Transmission of the same 
      pathogen from wound to blood was documented in 30% of the patients, with a rising 
      BSI frequency as the Ryan score increased. There were a total of 263 bacteremic 
      episodes in 88 study patients, 44% of blood isolates were documented previously 
      in wound cultures, and transmission of the same pathogen from wound to blood was 
      noted in 65% of bacteremic patients. CONCLUSIONS: When there is clinical 
      suspicion of sepsis, appropriate empirical systemic antibiotic therapy should be 
      broad spectrum and should rely on the susceptibility of the organisms from recent 
      cultures of the burn wound surface, until the blood cultures results are 
      completed.
