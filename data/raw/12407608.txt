TI  - Does ultrasound imaging before puncture facilitate internal jugular vein 
      cannulation? Prospective randomized comparison with landmark-guided puncture in 
      ventilated patients.
PG  - 572-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether prepuncture ultrasound evaluation of vascular 
      anatomy facilitates internal jugular vein cannulation compared with 
      landmark-guided puncture. DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. SETTING: Single 
      community hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients undergoing general anesthesia (n 
      = 240). INTERVENTIONS: The right internal jugular vein was cannulated using 
      either anatomic landmarks or prepuncture ultrasound (3.75/7.5 MHz) guidance. In 
      the landmark group, respiratory jugular venodilation was used as the primary 
      landmark for locating the vein. Results of cannulation and the incidence of 
      complications were compared. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients were 
      randomly assigned to the ultrasound or landmark group. Respiratory jugular 
      venodilation was identified in 188 patients (78.3%), in whom results of 
      cannulation did not differ between the 2 techniques with respect to the venous 
      access rate (cannulated at the first attempt: 83.5% in the landmark v 85.7% in 
      the ultrasound group), the success rate (cannulated within 3 attempts: 96.9% v 
      95.6%), and the incidence of arterial puncture (1.0% v 3.3%). In the remaining 52 
      respiratory jugular venodilation-unidentified patients, the access rate (30.4% v 
      86.2%, p < 0.001) and the success rate (78.3 v 100%, p < 0.05) were significantly 
      better in the ultrasound group, and no arterial puncture was recorded in the 
      ultrasound group, whereas the incidence was 13.0% in the landmark group. The 
      results were similar regardless of the ultrasound frequency used. CONCLUSION: 
      Prepuncture ultrasound evaluation did not improve the result of right internal 
      jugular vein cannulation compared with the respiratory jugular 
      venodilation-guided approach. When the landmark was not observed, however, the 
      prepuncture ultrasound guidance was helpful in facilitating the cannulation.
