TI  - Is year of radical prostatectomy a predictor of outcome in prostate cancer?
PG  - 692-6
AB  - PURPOSE: We examined whether the year in which radical prostatectomy (RP) was 
      performed is a predictor of treatment outcome after controlling for standard 
      prognostic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the association between RP 
      year and outcome in 6,556 patients from 7 centers using preoperative and 
      pathological features. Patients underwent surgery between 1985 and 2000. The 
      variables analyzed were RP year, clinical stage, pretreatment prostate specific 
      antigen, biopsy Gleason sum, RP Gleason sum, margin status, level of 
      extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle status, lymph node status, neoadjuvant 
      hormones and adjuvant therapy. Median followup was 23 months (maximum 166). 
      Separate Cox multivariate regression analyses were performed to analyze 
      preoperative and postoperative factors. RESULTS: RP year was a predictor of 
      outcome on preoperative analysis (p = 0.006) but not on postoperative analysis (p 
      = 0.130). Patient outcome steadily improved with surgery through the mid 1990s 
      and then it appeared to level off. CONCLUSIONS: When controlling for preoperative 
      features, the year in which RP was performed is a predictor of outcome on 
      multivariate analysis. This effect could not be explained by stage migration.
