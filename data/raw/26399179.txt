AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report three cases illustrating that it is not unusual for a 
      primary eyelid tumour to metastasise to the parotid gland and vice versa. CASE 
      REPORTS: Two patients with malignant parotid tumours underwent radical 
      parotidectomy and presented subsequently with eyelid lesions. Biopsy showed that 
      both eyelid lesions were histologically similar to the primary parotid tumour. A 
      third patient was noted to have ipsilateral upper eyelid and parotid gland 
      tumours. Histology and immunocytochemistry were used to differentiate the primary 
      tumour and the metastasis. CONCLUSION: These cases illustrate that tumours 
      involving eyelids and parotid glands can present simultaneously or sequentially, 
      and either of these structures could be the focus of primary or metastatic 
      tumour. The important message for oculoplastic and parotid surgeons is to 
      routinely assess both the periocular and parotid area when patients present with 
      a mass in either structure.
