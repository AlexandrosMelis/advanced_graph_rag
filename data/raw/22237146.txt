AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as prognostic or 
      predictive marker in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been 
      used widely. However, it may be difficult to get tumor tissue for analyzing the 
      status of EGFR mutation status in large proportion of patients with advanced 
      disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We obtained pairs of tumor and serum samples from 
      57 patients with advanced NSCLC, between March 2006 and January 2009. EGFR 
      mutation status from tumor samples was analyzed by genomic polymerase chain 
      reaction and direct sequence and EGFR mutation status from serum samples was 
      determined by the peptide nucleic acid locked nucleic acid polymerase chain 
      reaction clamp. RESULTS: EGFR mutations were detected in the serum samples of 11 
      patients and in the tumor samples of 12 patients. EGFR mutation status in the 
      serum and tumor samples was consistent in 50 of the 57 pairs (87.7%). There was a 
      high correlation between the mutations detected in serum sample and the mutations 
      detected in the matched tumor sample (correlation index 0.62; P<0.001). 
      Twenty-two of 57 patients (38.5%) received EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors as any 
      line therapy. The response for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors was significantly 
      associated with EGFR mutations in both tumor samples and serum samples (P<0.05). 
      There was no significant differences in overall survival according to the status 
      of EGFR mutations in both serum and tumor samples (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Serum 
      sample might be alternatively used in the difficult time of getting tumor tissue 
      for analyzing the status of EGFR mutation status in patients with advanced NSCLC.
