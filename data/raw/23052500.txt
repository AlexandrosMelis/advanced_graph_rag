TI  - Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: is it useful?
PG  - 826-31

AB  - BACKGROUND: Staging laparoscopy (SL) is not regularly performed for patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It may change treatment strategy, preventing 
      unnecessary open exploration. An additional advantage of SL is possible biopsy of 
      the nontumorous liver to assess fibrosis/cirrhosis. This study aimed to determine 
      whether SL for patients with HCC still is useful. METHODS: Patients with HCC who 
      underwent SL between January 1999 and December 2011 were analyzed. Their 
      demographics, preoperative imaging studies, surgical findings, and histology were 
      assessed. RESULTS: The 56 patients (34 men and 22 women; mean age, 60 +/- 14 years) 
      in this study underwent SL for assessment of extensive disease or metastases. For 
      two patients, SL was unsuccessful because of intraabdominal adhesions. For four 
      patients (7.1 %), SL showed unresectability because of metastases (n = 1), tumor 
      progression (n = 1), or severe cirrhosis in the contralateral lobe (n = 2). An 
      additional five patients did not undergo laparotomy due to disease progression 
      detected on imaging after SL. Exploratory laparotomy for the remaining 47 
      patients showed 6 (13 %) additional unresectable tumors due to advanced tumor (n 
      = 5) or nodal metastases (n = 1). Consequently, the yield of SL was 7 % (95 % 
      confidence interval (CI), 3-17 %), and the accuracy was 27 % (95 % CI, 11-52 %). 
      A biopsy of the contralateral liver was performed for 45 patients who underwent 
      SL, leading to changes in management for 4 patients (17 %) with cirrhosis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The overall yield of SL for HCC was 7 %, and the accuracy was 27 %. 
      When accurate imaging methods are available and additional percutaneous liver 
      biopsy is implemented as a standard procedure in the preoperative workup of 
      patients with HCC, the benefit of SL will become even less.
