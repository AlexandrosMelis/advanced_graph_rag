TI  - Does increased nerve length within the treatment volume improve trigeminal 
      neuralgia radiosurgery? A prospective double-blind, randomized study.
PG  - 449-54
AB  - PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that increasing the nerve length within the 
      treatment volume for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery would improve pain relief. 
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-seven patients with typical trigeminal neuralgia 
      were randomized to undergo retrogasserian gamma knife radiosurgery (75 Gy maximal 
      dose with 4-mm diameter collimators) using either one (n = 44) or two (n = 43) 
      isocenters. The median follow-up was 26 months (range 1-36). RESULTS: Pain relief 
      was complete in 57 patients (45 without medication and 12 with low-dose 
      medication), partial in 15, and minimal in another 15 patients. The actuarial 
      rate of obtaining complete pain relief (with or without medication) was 67.7% +/- 
      5.1%. The pain relief was identical for one- and two-isocenter radiosurgery. Pain 
      relapsed in 30 of 72 responding patients. Facial numbness and mild and severe 
      paresthesias developed in 8, 5, and 1 two-isocenter patients vs. 3, 4, and 0 
      one-isocenter patients, respectively (p = 0.23). Improved pain relief correlated 
      with younger age (p = 0.025) and fewer prior procedures (p = 0.039) and 
      complications (numbness or paresthesias) correlated with the nerve length 
      irradiated (p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the treatment volume to include a 
      longer nerve length for trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery does not significantly 
      improve pain relief but may increase complications.
