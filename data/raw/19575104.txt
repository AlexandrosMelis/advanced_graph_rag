TI  - Do foreign bodies migrate through the body towards the heart?
PG  - 195-9
AB  - Fixation of foreign bodies (FB), in the mucosa, can favor its migration, giving 
      origin to the popular saying: 'FB walk to the heart'. AIM: Describe the 
      mechanisms involved in FB migration and how to diagnose them. METHODOLOGY: From a 
      sample of 3,000 foreign bodies, during 40 years, we analyzed four which had 
      extra-lumen migration. We analyzed clinical, radiologic, endoscopic and 
      ultrasound data collected at the medical documentation service. RESULTS: Three 
      clinical histories are presented, describing two fish bones and one piece of fish 
      cartilage. FB shifting was analyzed in all of them. Migration started in the 
      esophagus in two, one going to the aorta and the other to the neck area. In the 
      other two, migration started in the pharynx, and the FB moved towards the 
      prevertebral fascia and the other externalized in the submandibular region. The 
      mechanisms and the risks posed to the patient, by FB migration, and the way to 
      diagnose them are hereby discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The study allows us to determine 
      that FB can move through the body but not towards the heart. The study also 
      serves as a warning sign: in cases of prolonged histories of FB ingestion, 
      imaging studies are mandatory before endoscopic examination.
