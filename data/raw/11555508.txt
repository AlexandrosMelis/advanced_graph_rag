TI  - Do inhaled corticosteroids affect perception of dyspnea during 
      bronchoconstriction in asthma?
PG  - 770-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some of the disagreements on the perception of dyspnea (PD) during 
      bronchoconstriction in asthma patients could depend on the interrelationships 
      among the following: (1) the influence of baseline airflow obstruction on the 
      patient's ability to detect any further increase in airway resistance; (2) the 
      effect of eosinophilic inflammation on the airway; (3) bronchial 
      hyperresponsiveness (BHR); and (4) the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). 
      OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that if the inflammation of the airway wall influences 
      to some extent and in some way the PD in asthma patients, ICSs reverse the effect 
      of airway inflammation on the PD. METHODS: We studied 100 asthma patients who 
      were divided into the following four groups: patients with obstruction who were 
      either ICS-naive (group I) or were treated with ICSs (group II); and 
      nonobstructed patients who were either ICS-naive (group III) or were treated with 
      ICSs (group IV). PD on the visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed during a 
      methacholine-induced FEV(1) decrease and specifically was quantified as the VAS 
      slope and score at an FEV(1) decrease of 5 to 20%. BHR was assessed in terms of 
      the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) 
      (PC(20)). Eosinophil counts in induced sputum samples also were performed. 
      Regression analysis, univariate analysis of variance, and factor analysis were 
      applied for statistical evaluation. RESULTS: For a 5 to 20% fall in FEV(1) from 
      the lowest point after saline solution induction, VAS score was lowest in group 
      II, slightly higher in group I, slightly higher still in group IV, and the 
      highest in group III. In the patients as a whole, BHR related to PD, but age, 
      clinical score, duration of the disease, and presence of baseline airway 
      obstruction did not. In patients with obstruction who were treated with ICSs, 
      eosinophil counts related to PD negatively. Factor analysis yielded the following 
      four factors that accounted for 70% of the variance in the data: ICS; eosinophil 
      counts; FEV(1); and PC(20) loaded on separated factors with PD loading on the 
      same factors as PC(20). The post hoc analysis carried out dividing the patients 
      into ICS-treated and ICS-naive, showed that in the former group eosinophil counts 
      and BHR proved to be factors negatively associated with PD, while in the latter 
      group eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      shown that eosinophilic inflammation of the airway wall may increase PD and that 
      the association of eosinophil counts with ICSs may result in lessening the PD.
