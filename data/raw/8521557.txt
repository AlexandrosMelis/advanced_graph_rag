TI  - The insertion allele of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism. A candidate gene for 
      insulin resistance?
PG  - 3390-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: The insertion/deletion (ID) polymorphism of the 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been associated with increased 
      coronary heart disease (CHD), although the mechanism of this association is not 
      apparent. We tested the hypothesis that the deletion allele of the ACE gene is 
      associated with insulin resistance. METHODS AND RESULTS: We related ACE genotype 
      to components of the insulin-resistance syndrome in 103 non-insulin-dependent 
      diabetic (NIDDM) and 533 nondiabetic white subjects. NIDDM subjects with the DD 
      genotype had significantly lower levels of specific insulin (DD 38.6, ID 57.1, 
      and II 87.4 pmol.L-1 by ANOVA, P = .011). Non-insulin-treated subjects with the 
      DD genotype had increased insulin sensitivity by HOMA % (DD 56.4%, II 29.4%, P = 
      .027) and lower levels of des 31,32 proinsulin (DD 3.3, II 7.6 pmol.L-1, P = 
      .012) compared with II subjects. There were no differences in prevalence of CHD 
      or levels of blood pressure, serum lipids, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 
      (PAI-1) activity between the three ACE genotypes. In nondiabetic subjects there 
      were no differences in insulin sensitivity, levels of insulin-like molecules, 
      blood pressure, PAI-1, serum lipids, or CHD prevalence between the three ACE 
      genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that increased cardiovascular risk of the DD 
      genotype is not mediated through insulin resistance or abnormalities in 
      fibrinolysis. Conversely, we report an increased sensitivity in NIDDM subjects 
      with the ACE DD genotype.
