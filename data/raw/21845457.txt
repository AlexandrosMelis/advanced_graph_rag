TI  - Outcomes of severely injured adult trauma patients in an Australian health 
      service: does trauma center level make a difference?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trauma centers are designated to provide systematized 
      multidisciplinary care to injured patients. Effective trauma systems reduce 
      patient mortality by facilitating the treatment of injured patients at 
      appropriately resourced hospitals. Several U.S. studies report reduced mortality 
      among patients admitted directly to a level I trauma center compared with those 
      admitted to hospitals with less resources. It has yet to be shown whether there 
      is an outcome benefit associated with the "level of hospital" initially treating 
      severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to 
      determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts 
      mortality and/or hospital length of stay. METHODS: Outcomes were evaluated for 
      severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15 using 
      NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management data from 2002-2007 for our 
      regional health service. To assess the association between trauma centers and 
      binary outcomes, a logistic regression model was used. To assess the association 
      between trauma centers and continuous outcomes, a multivariable linear regression 
      model was used. Sex, age, and ISS were included as covariates in all models. 
      RESULTS: There were 1,986 trauma presentations during the 6-year period. Patients 
      presenting to a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death 
      than those presenting to the level I center, regardless of age, sex, ISS, or 
      prehospital time. Peer review of deaths at the level III center identified 
      problems in care delivery in 15 cases associated with technical errors, delay in 
      decision making, or errors of judgement. CONCLUSION: Severely injured patients 
      treated at a level III center had a higher mortality rate than those treated at a 
      level I center. Most problems identified occurred in the emergency department and 
      were related to delays in care provision. This research highlights the importance 
      of efficient prehospital, in-hospital, and regional trauma systems, performance 
      monitoring, peer review, and adherence to protocols and guidelines.
