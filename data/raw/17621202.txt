TI  - Does shaving the incision site increase the infection rate after spinal surgery?
PG  - 1575-7
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized clinical study. OBJECTIVE: To determine 
      whether shaving the incision site before spinal surgery causes postsurgical 
      infection. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spine surgeons usually shave the skin of 
      the incision site immediately before surgery is performed. However, evidence from 
      some surgical series suggests that presurgical shaving may increase the 
      postsurgical infection rate. To our knowledge, no previously published studies 
      have addressed this issue. METHODS: A total of 789 patients scheduled to undergo 
      spinal surgery were randomly allocated into 2 groups: those in whom the site of 
      operation was shaved immediately before surgery (shaved group; 371 patients) and 
      the patients in whom presurgical shaving was not performed (unshaved group; 418 
      patients). The mean duration of anesthesia and the infection rates in both groups 
      were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The duration of anesthesia did not differ in 
      the 2 groups (P > 0.05). A postoperative infection developed in 4 patients in the 
      shaved group and in 1 patient in the nonshaved group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      shaving of the incision site immediately before spinal surgery may increase the 
      rate of postoperative infection.
