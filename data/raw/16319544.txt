TI  - Is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein associated with carotid atherosclerosis in 
      healthy Koreans?
PG  - 548-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a positive association between chronic inflammation and the 
      risk of cardiovascular disease, but whether there is an association between 
      C-reactive protein (CRP) and carotid atherosclerosis is controversial. We 
      investigated the relationship between high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels and 
      carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in healthy Koreans. DESIGN: We measured 
      hsCRP levels, the carotid IMT, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors 
      including obesity parameters, blood pressure, lipid profiles, insulin resistance, 
      and smoking habits in 820 volunteers (35-79 years old) in a cross-sectional 
      study. RESULTS: Higher hsCRP quartile groups had higher mean IMTs, as compared 
      with the lowest quartile (P < 0.001 for the trend across quartiles). However, 
      after adjustment for age, the relationship between hsCRP level and IMT was 
      substantially weaker (P = 0.018). After additional adjustments for conventional 
      cardiovascular risk factors, no significant association was observed (P = 0.548). 
      The unadjusted risk for a high carotid IMT value (> or = 1.0 mm) was also 
      positively related to hsCRP quartile, but this relationship was not significant 
      after adjustment for age and other cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Both 
      hsCRP levels and the carotid IMT were strongly correlated with conventional 
      cardiovascular risk factors, but there was no independent association between 
      hsCRP levels and carotid IMT in healthy Korean adults.
