TI  - High cumulative insulin exposure: a risk factor of atherosclerosis in type 1 
      diabetes?
PG  - 185-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since insulin therapy might have an atherogenic effect, we studied 
      the relationship between cumulative insulin dose and atherosclerosis in type 1 
      diabetes. We have focused on patients with type 1 diabetes instead of type 2 
      diabetes to minimise the effect of insulin resistance as a potential confounder. 
      METHODS: An observational study was performed in 215 subjects with type 1 
      diabetes treated with multiple insulin injection therapy. Atherosclerosis was 
      assessed by measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). RESULTS: The 
      cumulative dose of regular insulin showed a positive and significant relation 
      with CIMT: increase of 21 microm in CIMT per S.D. of insulin use (95% CI: 8-35 
      adjusted for gender and age), which remained unchanged after adjustment for 
      duration of diabetes, HbA1c, BMI, pulse pressure, physical activity and carotid 
      lumen diameter. A similar relation was found for intermediate-acting insulin: 
      15.5 microm per S.D. (2-29), which was no longer present after further 
      adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence that a high cumulative 
      dose of regular insulin is a risk factor for atherosclerosis.
