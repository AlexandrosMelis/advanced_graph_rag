TI  - [Rotator cuff tear--an occupational disease? An epidemiological analysis].
PG  - 519-23
AB  - BACKGROUND: In literature there are only few data which describe the influence of 
      occupation on the development of rotator cuff disease. METHODS: In a 
      retrospective study, 760 open rotator cuff repairs were analysed and related to 
      the profession and occupational load. Exclusion criteria were traumatic tears and 
      sports injuries. All male persons were statistically analysed and the data 
      compared with occupational patterns of the region, obtained from the Federal 
      Statistical State Office. RESULTS: Rotator cuff repairs were performed in 472 
      males who had no evidence for a traumatic origin. After statistical analysis (p < 
      0.001) we found significantly more patients working in agriculture and forestry 
      (6.38% versus 1.07% in Bavaria) and in the building industry (35.11% versus 
      13.40% in Bavaria). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that working exposure increases 
      the risk or leads to the clinical manifestation of rotator cuff tears. Although a 
      detailed analysis of individual physical exposure is not available yet, the 
      statistical results indicate that rotator cuff tears must be taken into 
      consideration as a result of ergonomic exposure.
