AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study is to determine to what extent the 
      reduction of Chile's traffic fatalities and injuries during 2000-2012 was related 
      to the police traffic enforcement increment registered after the introduction of 
      its 2005 traffic law reform. METHODS: A unique dataset with assembled information 
      from public institutions and analyses based on ordinary least square and robust 
      random effects models was carried out. Dependent variables were traffic fatality 
      and severe injury rates per population and vehicle fleet. Independent variables 
      were: (1) presence of new national traffic law; (2) police officers per 
      population; (3) number of traffic tickets per police officer; and (4) interaction 
      effect of number of traffic tickets per police officer with traffic law reform. 
      Oil prices, alcohol consumption, proportion of male population 15-24 years old, 
      unemployment, road infrastructure investment, years' effects and regions' effects 
      represented control variables. RESULTS: Empirical estimates from instrumental 
      variables suggest that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction 
      with number of traffic tickets per police officer is significantly associated 
      with a decrease of 8% in traffic fatalities and 7% in severe injuries. Piecewise 
      regression model results for the 2007-2012 period suggest that police traffic 
      enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that traffic law reforms in order to have an effect 
      on both traffic fatality and injury rates reduction require changes in police 
      enforcement practices. Last, this case also illustrates how the diffusion of 
      successful road safety practices globally promoted by WHO and World Bank can be 
      an important influence for enhancing national road safety practices.
