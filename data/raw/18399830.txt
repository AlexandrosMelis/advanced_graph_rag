AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether robotically assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy 
      (RALP) is less invasive than radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP), as 
      experimental studies suggest that the acute phase reaction is proportional to 
      surgery-induced tissue damage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May and November 
      2006, all patients undergoing RRP or RALP in our department were prospectively 
      assessed. Blood samples were collected 24 h before (T0), during surgery (T1), at 
      the end of anaesthesia (T2), and 12 (T3) and 24 h after surgery (T4), and assayed 
      for interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-1 alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate. The 
      Mann-Whitney U-, Student's t- and Friedman tests were used to compare continuous 
      variables, and the Pearson chi-square and Fisher test for categorical variables, 
      with a two-sided P < 0.05 considered to indicate significance. RESULTS: In all, 
      35 and 26 patients were assessed for RALP and RRP, respectively; the median 
      (interquartile range) age was 62 (56-68) and 68.5 (59.2-71.2) years, respectively 
      (P < 0.009). Baseline levels (T0) of IL-1, IL-6, CRP and lactate were comparable 
      in both arms. IL-6, CRP and lactates levels increased during both kinds of 
      surgery. The mean IL-6 and CPR values were higher for RRP at T1 (P = 0.01 and 
      0.001), T2 (P = 0.001 and <0.001), T3 (P = 0.002 and <0.001) and T4 (P < 0.001 
      and 0.02), respectively. Lactate was higher for RRP at T2 (P = 0.001), T3 (P = 
      0.001) and T4 (P = 0.004), although remaining within the normal ranges. IL-1 
      alpha did not change at the different sample times. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      showed for the first time that RALP induces lower tissue trauma than RRP.
