      reconstruction?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the 
      postoperative outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction and the 
      anterior laxity of the uninjured knee. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 163 
      patients who had undergone unilateral ACL reconstruction from January 2002 to 
      August 2009. Patients were divided into three groups according to the anterior 
      laxity of the contralateral, normal knee in 30 degrees  of knee flexion as measured with 
      a KT2000 arthrometer exerting a force of 134 N: <5 mm for Group 1, 5 to 7.5 mm 
      for Group 2, and >7.5 mm for Group 3. Anterior laxity of the uninjured knee was 
      assessed preoperatively, and anterior laxity of the reconstructed knee was 
      assessed at twenty-four months postoperatively. Anterior stability of the knee 
      was also assessed with use of the Lachman and pivot-shift tests. Functional 
      outcomes were assessed with the Lysholm score and the International Knee 
      Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. RESULTS: The three groups differed 
      significantly with respect to the postoperative side-to-side difference in 
      anterior laxity (p = 0.015), Lysholm score (p < 0.001), and IKDC subjective score 
      (p < 0.001). The mean side-to-side difference in anterior laxity of the 
      reconstructed knee was 2.1 +/- 1.3 mm in Group 1, 2.2 +/- 1.3 mm in Group 2, and 2.9 
      +/- 1.4 mm in Group 3. The postoperative Lysholm score was 91.8 +/- 4.5 in Group 1, 
      90.3 +/- 5.5 in Group 2, and 85.4 +/- 6.6 in Group 3. The postoperative IKDC 
      subjective score was 89.3 +/- 6.4 in Group 1, 87.9 +/- 6.0 in Group 2, and 82.6 +/- 8.2 
      in Group 3. Post hoc testing showed that Group 3 had significantly greater 
      anterior laxity (p </= 0.039) and lower functional scores (p </= 0.001) compared with 
      Groups 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: Greater anterior laxity of the uninjured knee was 
      associated with poorer stability and functional outcomes after ACL 
      reconstruction. Excessive anterior laxity of the uninjured knee thus appears to 
      represent a risk factor for inferior outcomes.
