TI  - Does the treatment of amblyopia normalise subfoveal choroidal thickness in 
      amblyopic children?

AB  - PURPOSE: Recent studies have found a choroidal thickening in amblyopic eyes and 
      suggested that there might be a relationship between the choroid and amblyopia. 
      The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a six-month treatment of 
      amblyopia on choroidal thickness in anisometropic hyperopic amblyopic children. 
      METHODS: Thirty-two anisometropic hyperopic children with unilateral amblyopia 
      were included in this prospective study. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was 
      measured as the distance between the retinal pigment epithelium and the 
      chorioscleral edge, by using spectral domain enhanced depth imaging optical 
      coherence tomography. The treatment of amblyopia was performed based on the full 
      correction of the refractive error with eyeglasses, a refractive adaptation phase 
      and occlusion by patching the fellow eye. RESULTS: The mean visual acuity of the 
      amblyopic eyes significantly increased from 0.35 +/- 0.3 to 0.16 +/- 0.2 logMAR after 
      the treatment (p < 0.001). The mean initial choroidal thickness was significantly 
      higher in the amblyopic eyes than in the fellow eyes (p = 0.019). There were no 
      significant differences between the pre- and post-treatment mean choroidal 
      thickness in the amblyopic eyes (p = 0.428) and in the fellow eyes (p = 0.343). 
      The mean choroidal thickness was still higher in the amblyopic eyes than in the 
      fellow eyes after the treatment (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Although a six-month 
      treatment of amblyopia increased the visual acuity of the anisometropic hyperopic 
      amblyopic eyes, it could not significantly change choroidal thickness. Our 
      results were in accordance with the conventional explanation, which suggests 
      visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus abnormalities in the pathophysiology 
      of amblyopia.
