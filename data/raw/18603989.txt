TI  - Can homemade alcohol (Raksi) be useful for preserving dead bodies? An experiment 
      on wistar albino rats.
PG  - 68-71
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Embalming is the through disinfection and art of preserving bodies 
      after death using chemical substances. It keeps a body life like in appearance 
      during the time it lies in a state prior to funeral. OBJECTIVE: This study was 
      undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of Raksi in sacrificed rats in 
      arresting postmortem changes and establishing scientific fact whether Raksi can 
      be an alternative to standard embalming constituent if it is not available. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50 albino rats were systematically randomized into control 
      and experiment groups. Raksi and distilled water were injected for embalming 
      purpose intraventricularly in experiment and control groups of rats respectively 
      and kept for 48 to 96 hours for observation for postmortem changes. RESULT: 
      Observations made at 48 and 72 hours of embalming revealed that Raksi can arrest 
      postmortem changes in the rats up to 72 hours (3rd day) successfully in the 
      experimental group whereas moderate to severe postmortem changes were seen in the 
      control group. The experimental group showed mild degree of putrefactive changes, 
      liberation of gases and liquefaction of tissues only at 96 hours (4th day) of 
      embalming. DISCUSSION: The Raksi used in this experiment contained 34% of 
      alcohol, which was determined by an alcohol hydrometer. Experiment clearly 
      demonstrated from its result that raksi can be utilised temporarily for embalming 
      since it contains alcohol and has preservative, bactericidal and disinfectant 
      properties. CONCLUSION: It is concluded from the study that this knowledge if 
      applied to dead human subjects, may preserve dead bodies temporarily allowing 
      delayed funeral.
