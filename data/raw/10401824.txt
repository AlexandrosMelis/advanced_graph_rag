TI  - Is laparoscopic reoperation for failed antireflux surgery feasible?
PG  - 733-7
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Laparoscopic techniques can be used to treat patients whose 
      antireflux surgery has failed. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Two academic medical 
      centers. PATIENTS: Forty-six consecutive patients, of whom 21 were male and 25 
      were female (mean age, 55.6 years; range, 15-80 years). Previous antireflux 
      procedures were laparoscopic (21 patients), laparotomy (21 patients), thoracotomy 
      (3 patients), and thoracoscopy (1 patient). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The cause of 
      failure, operative and postoperative morbidity, and the level of follow-up 
      satisfaction were determined for all patients. RESULTS: The causes of failure 
      were hiatal herniation (31 patients [67%]), fundoplication breakdown (20 patients 
      [43%]), fundoplication slippage (9 patients [20%]), tight fundoplication (5 
      patients [11%]), misdiagnosed achalasia (2 patients [4%]), and displaced 
      Angelchik prosthesis (2 patients [4%]). Twenty-two patients (48%) had more than 1 
      cause. Laparoscopic reoperative procedures were Nissen fundoplication (n = 22), 
      Toupet fundoplication (n = 13), paraesophageal hernia repair (n = 4), Dor 
      procedure (n = 2), Angelchik prosthesis removal (n = 2), Heller myotomy (n = 2), 
      and the takedown of a wrap (n = 1). In addition, 18 patients required crural 
      repair and 13 required paraesophageal hernia repair. The mean +/- SEM duration of 
      surgery was 3.5+/-1.1 hours. Operative complications were fundus tear (n = 8), 
      significant bleeding (n = 4), bougie perforation (n = 1), small bowel enterotomy 
      (n = 1), and tension pneumothorax (n = 1). The conversion rate (from laparoscopic 
      to an open procedure) was 20% overall (9 patients) but 0% in the last 10 
      patients. Mortality was 0%. The mean +/- SEM hospital stay was 2.3+/-0.9 days for 
      operations completed laparoscopically. Follow-up was possible in 35 patients 
      (76%) at 17.2+/-11.8 months. The well-being score (1 best; 10, worst) was 
      8.6+/-2.1 before and 2.9+/-2.4 after surgery (P<.001). Thirty-one (89%) of 35 
      patients were satisfied with their decision to have reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Antireflux surgery failures are most commonly associated with hiatal herniation, 
      followed by the breakdown of the fundoplication. The laparoscopic approach may be 
      used successfully to treat patients with failed antireflux operations. Good 
      results were achieved despite the technical difficulty of the procedures.
