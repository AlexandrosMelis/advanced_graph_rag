TI  - Are sugars-free medicines more erosive than sugars-containing medicines? An in 
      vitro study of paediatric medicines with prolonged oral clearance used regularly 
      and long-term by children.
PG  - 231-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The reduced use of sugars-containing (SC) liquid medicines has 
      increased the use of other dose forms, potentially resulting in more widespread 
      dental effects, including tooth wear. The aim of this study was to assess the 
      erosive potential of 97 paediatric medicines in vitro. METHODS: The study took 
      the form of in vitro measurement of endogenous pH and titratable acidity (mmol). 
      Endogenous pH was measured using a pH meter, followed by titration to pH 7.0 with 
      0.1-M NaOH. RESULTS: Overall, 55 (57%) formulations had an endogenous pH of < 
      5.5. The mean (+/- SD) endogenous pH and titratable acidity for 41 SC 
      formulations were 5.26 +/- 1.30 and 0.139 +/- 0.133 mmol, respectively; for 56 
      sugars-free (SF) formulations, these figures were 5.73 +/- 1.53 and 0.413 +/- 
      1.50 mmol (P > 0.05). Compared with their SC bioequivalents, eight SF medicines 
      showed no significant differences for pH or titratable acidity, while 15 
      higher-strength medicines showed lower pH (P = 0.035) and greater titratable 
      acidity (P = 0.016) than their lower-strength equivalents. Chewable and 
      dispersible tablets (P < 0.001), gastrointestinal medicines (P = 0.002) and 
      antibiotics (P = 0.007) were significant predictors of higher pH. In contrast, 
      effervescent tablets (P < 0.001), and nutrition and blood preparations (P = 
      0.021) were significant predictors of higher titratable acidity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Paediatric SF medicines were not more erosive than SC medicines in vitro; a more 
      significant predictor of their erosive potential was dose form.
