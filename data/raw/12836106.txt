TI  - [Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury?].
PG  - 111-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Injury severity score (ISS), Glasgow coma score (GCS), and revised 
      trauma score (RTS) are the most frequently used methods to evaluate the severity 
      of injury in blunt trauma patients. ISS is too complicated to assess easily and 
      GCS and RTS are easy to assess but somewhat subjective. White blood cell count 
      (WBC) is an easy, quick and objective test. This study was performed to evaluate 
      the significance of the WBC count at presentation in the blunt trauma patients. 
      METHODS: 713 blunt trauma patients, who were admitted to the Uludag University 
      Medical Center Emergency Department between 01.04.2000-31.12.2000, were 
      retrospectively evaluated in terms of ISS, GCS, RTS and white blood cell count at 
      presentation. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that WBC was correlated 
      positively with ISS, but negatively with GCS and RTS. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte 
      count at presentation can be used as an adjunct in the evaluation of the severity 
      of injury in blunt trauma patients.
