TI  - Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white 
      patients?
PG  - 976-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial differences in asthma care are not fully explained by 
      socioeconomic status, care access, and insurance status. Appropriate care 
      requires accurate physician estimates of severity. It is unknown if accuracy of 
      physician estimates differs between black and white patients, and how this 
      relates to asthma care disparities. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that: 1) physician 
      underestimation of asthma severity is more frequent among black patients; 2) 
      among black patients, physician underestimation of severity is associated with 
      poorer quality asthma care. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: We conducted a 
      cross-sectional survey among adult patients with asthma cared for in 15 managed 
      care organizations in the United States. We collected physicians' estimates of 
      their patients' asthma severity. Physicians' estimates of patients' asthma as 
      being less severe than patient-reported symptoms were classified as 
      underestimates of severity. MEASUREMENTS: Frequency of underestimation, asthma 
      care, and communication. RESULTS: Three thousand four hundred and ninety-four 
      patients participated (13% were black). Blacks were significantly more likely 
      than white patients to have their asthma severity underestimated (OR = 1.39, 95% 
      CI 1.08-1.79). Among black patients, underestimation was associated with less use 
      of daily inhaled corticosteroids (13% vs 20%, p < .05), less physician 
      instruction on management of asthma flare-ups (33% vs 41%, p < .0001), and lower 
      ratings of asthma care (p = .01) and physician communication (p = .04). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Biased estimates of asthma severity may contribute to racially 
      disparate asthma care. Interventions to improve physicians' assessments of asthma 
      severity and patient-physician communication may minimize racial disparities in 
      asthma care.
