TI  - Attaining negative margins in breast-conservation operations: is there a 
      consensus among breast surgeons?

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this survey was to ascertain the most common surgical 
      practices for attaining negative (tumor-free) surgical margins in patients 
      desiring breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer to see if a consensus 
      exists for optimal treatment of patients. STUDY DESIGN: We sent a survey to 1,000 
      surgeons interested in the treatment of breast cancer. Three hundred eighty-one 
      surgeons responded to this survey and 351 were used for the analysis (response 
      rate of 38%). RESULTS: Answers showed a large variety in clinical practices among 
      breast surgeons across the country. There was little intraoperative margin 
      analysis; only 48% of surgeons examine the margins grossly with a pathologist and 
      even fewer used frozen sections or imprint cytology. Decisions to reexcise 
      specific margins varied greatly. For example, 57% of surgeons would never 
      reexcise for a positive deep margin, but 53% would always reexcise for a positive 
      anterior margin. Most importantly, there was a large range in answers about 
      acceptable margins with ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma. Fifteen 
      percent of surgeons would accept any negative margin, 28% would accept a 1-mm 
      negative margin, 50% would accept a 2-mm negative margin, 12% would accept a 5-mm 
      negative margin, and 3% would accept a 10-mm negative margin. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Results of this survey highlight the wide variety of practice patterns in the US 
      for handling surgical margins in breast-conservation treatment. This issue 
      remains controversial, with no prevailing standard of care. Consequently, 
      additional study is needed in the modern era of multimodality treatment to 
      examine the minimal amount of surgical treatment necessary, in conjunction with 
      chemotherapy and radiation, to attain adequate local control rates in 
      breast-conservation treatment.
