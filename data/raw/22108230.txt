AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of inflammatory cytokines and the 
      fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) in persons undergoing surgical treatment for 
      cervical radiculopathy caused by disk herniation. DESIGN: Single-center, 
      prospective, consecutive case series. SETTING: A single large academic 
      institution. PATIENTS: A total of 11 patients with radiculopathic pain and 
      magnetic resonance imaging findings positive for disk herniation elected to 
      undergo single-level cervical diskectomy. METHODS OR INTERVENTIONS: Lavage was 
      performed by needle injection and aspiration upon entering the disk space for 
      fluoroscopic localization before diskectomy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The 
      lavage fluid was assayed for pH and the FAC, as well as for the cytokines 
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), interferon-gamma, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP), and 
      macrophage inhibitory protein-1beta. RESULTS: The subjects were 7 women and 4 men 
      with a mean age of 50.6 years (SE 9.7; range, 36-70 years). The mean 
      concentrations (SE; range) in picograms per milliliter were 7.9 (4.4; 0-44) for 
      IL-6, 25.3 (15.5; 0-159) for interferon-gamma, 16.1 (11.9; 0-121) for MCP, and 6.1 
      (2.8; 0-29) for macrophage inhibitory protein-1beta. The optical density of the FAC 
      at 450 nm was 0.151 (0.036; 0.1-0.32), and the pH was 6.68 (0.1; 6.10-7.15). 
      Statistically significant correlations were found between MCP and FAC (P = .036) 
      and between FAC and pH (P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Biochemical analysis of injured 
      cervical intervertebral disks reveals the presence of inflammatory markers such 
      as MCP, fragments of structural matrix proteins such as FAC, and a correlation 
      with pH. Further evaluation of the FAC as a potential diagnostic biomarker or 
      therapeutic target is warranted in the cervical spine.
