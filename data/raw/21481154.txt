TI  - Improvements in survival of gynaecological cancer in the Anglia region of 
      England: are these an effect of centralisation of care and use of 
      multidisciplinary management?

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Our hypothesis is that the adoption of Department of Health (DH) 
      guidance has led to an improvement in outcome in gynaecological cancer survival. 
      SETTING: In 1999 the DH in England introduced the Improving Outcomes in 
      Gynaecological Cancer guidance, advising case management by multidisciplinary 
      teams with surgical concentration in specialist hospitals. This guidance was 
      rapidly adopted in the East of England, with a population of 2.5 million. 
      POPULATION: The population of the Anglia Cancer Network was approximately 2.3 
      million. METHODS: From 1996 to 2003, details of 3406 cases of gynaecological 
      cancer were identified in the Anglia region of England. Survival analysis was 
      performed by Cox proportional hazards regression, relative to cases diagnosed in 
      1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Primary endpoint was survival. RESULTS: The survival 
      rates for cases diagnosed between 1996 and 1999 were broadly the same across the 
      time period, with a marked improvement taking place in 2000, and continuing to 
      2003 (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79, comparing 2000-03 with 1996-99 diagnoses), for 
      all gynaecological sites combined. Adjustment for treatments or method of case 
      follow-up did not attenuate these improvements. There was a concurrent change 
      towards major surgery being performed in specialist centres from 2000. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of the 1999 guidance on gynaecological cancer, which 
      included multidisciplinary case management and centralisation of surgery, 
      resulted in a marked step-change improvement in survival of gynaecological cancer 
      in an area of eastern England in 2000.
