AB  - PURPOSE: Lower limb compartment syndrome has been reported to occur after 
      colorectal, urological, and gynecological procedures during which the patient's 
      lower limbs are elevated for prolonged periods of time. METHOD: We investigated 
      lower limb perfusion in a group of patients undergoing prolonged pelvic surgery 
      both during and immediately after surgery, using intra-arterial blood pressure 
      monitoring, laser doppler flowmetry, and pulse oximetry. RESULTS: Use of the 
      modified lithotomy position was not associated with any demonstrable decrease in 
      lower limb perfusion. The addition of 15 degrees head-down tilt, however, during 
      pelvic dissection, led to an immediate and significant drop in lower limb 
      perfusion (P < 0.05; Mann-Whitney U test). The subgroup of patients analyzed 
      postoperatively showed a ten-fold increase (P < 0.01) in perfusion that was 
      confined to the muscle compartment with no demonstrable increase in skin 
      perfusion or intra-arterial pedal blood pressure. CONCLUSION: The use of the 
      modified lithotomy position during pelvic surgery is not associated with lower 
      limb ischemia. Addition of Trendelenburg position, however, causes profound 
      ischemia of the lower limbs, and this is followed during the recovery period by 
      hyperperfusion that is confined to the muscle compartments, which may put 
      patients at risk of developing lower limb compartment syndrome.
