AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Sleep bruxism (SB) is reported to vary in frequency over time. 
      The aim of this study was to assess the first night effect on SB. METHODS: A 
      retrospective polysomnographic (PSG) analysis was performed of data from a sample 
      of SB patients (12 females, 4 males; age range: 17-39 years) recorded in a sleep 
      laboratory over 2 consecutive nights. Sleep parameters and jaw muscle activity 
      variables (i.e., rhythmic masticatory muscle activity [RMMA]) for SB were 
      quantified and compared between the 2 nights. Subjects were classified into 
      groups according to severity of RMMA frequency, such as low frequency (2-4 
      episodes/h and/or < 25 bursts/h) and moderate-high frequency (>/= 4 episodes/h and 
      >/= 25 bursts/h). RESULTS: Overall, no first night effects were found for most 
      sleep variables. However, total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and stage 
      transitions showed significant time and group interactions (repeated measures 
      ANOVAs, p </= 0.05). The RMMA episode index did not differ between the 2 nights, 
      whereas the second night showed significantly higher burst index, bruxism time 
      index, and mean burst duration (repeated measure ANOVAs, p </= 0.05). Five patients 
      of 8 in the low frequency group were classified into the moderate-high frequency 
      group on the second night, whereas only one patient in the moderate-high 
      frequency group moved to the low frequency group. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed 
      no overall first night effect on severity of RMMA frequency in young and healthy 
      patients with SB. In clinical practice, one-night sleep recording may be 
      sufficient for moderate-high frequency SB patients. However, low RMMA frequency 
      in the first night could be confirmed by a second night based on the patient's 
      medical and dental history.
