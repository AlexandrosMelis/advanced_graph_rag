TI  - Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic 
      Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between injury severity surrogates and 
      other patient factors with the development and severity of heterotopic 
      ossification (HO) following open reduction internal fixation of acetabular 
      fractures treated with a posterior approach. DESIGN: Retrospective review. 
      SETTING: Academic level 1 trauma center. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-one 
      patients who were treated through a posterior approach with a minimum of 6-month 
      radiographic follow-up were identified from an acetabular fracture database. 
      INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The occurrence and severity (Brooker 
      Grade III/IV) of HO 6 months postsurgery. RESULTS: Length of stay (LOS) in the 
      intensive care unit (ICU), non-ICU LOS >10 days, and HO prophylaxis with external 
      radiation beam therapy (XRT) were significantly associated with the development 
      of HO in a multivariate model [ICU LOS: 1-2 days, odds ratio (OR) = 4.33, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 1.03-18.25; 3-6 days, OR = 4.1, 95% CI, 1.27-13.27; >6 
      days, OR = 11.7, 95% CI, 3.24-42.22; non-ICU LOS >10 days (vs. 0-6 days): OR = 
      7.6, 95% CI, 2.6-22.25; XRT HO prophylaxis: OR = 0.29, 95% CI, 0.10-0.85]. Other 
      variables evaluated in multivariate modeling not significantly associated with 
      development and severity of HO included age, gender, mechanism of injury, injury 
      severity score, presence of neurologic injury, Letournel fracture type, 
      occurrence of hip dislocation, interval from injury to surgery, operative time, 
      and estimated blood loss. CONCLUSIONS: Surrogates of injury severity, including 
      days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS >10 days, were associated with the 
      development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with 
      XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability 
      to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete 
      description of levels of evidence.
