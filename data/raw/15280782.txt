TI  - Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?
PG  - 1707-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of new diagnoses of HIV infection is rising in the 
      northwestern hemisphere and it is becoming increasingly important to understand 
      the mechanisms behind this trend. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether reported unsafe 
      sexual behaviour among HIV- infected individuals is changing over time. DESIGN: 
      Participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study were asked about their sexual 
      practices every 6 months for 3 years during regular follow-up of the cohort 
      beginning on 1 April 2000. METHODS: : Logistic regression models were fit using 
      generalized estimating equations assuming a constant correlation between 
      responses from the same individual. RESULTS: At least one sexual behaviour 
      questionnaire was obtained for 6545 HIV-infected individuals and the median 
      number of questionnaires completed per individual was five. There was no evidence 
      of an increase in reported unsafe sex over time in this population [odds ratio 
      (OR), 1.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.96-1.05]. Females (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 
      1.19-1.60), 15-30 year olds (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47), those with 
      HIV-positive partners (OR, 12.58; 95% CI, 10.84-14.07) and those with occasional 
      partners (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 2.87-3.67) were more likely to report unsafe sex. 
      There was no evidence of a response bias over time, but individuals were less 
      willing to leave questions about their sexual behaviour unanswered or ambiguous 
      (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of a trend in 
      unsafe sex behaviour over time. However, several subgroups were identified as 
      being more likely to report unsafe sex and should be targeted for specific 
      interventions.
