TI  - Fragility of the esophageal mucosa: a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary 
      eosinophilic esophagitis?
PG  - 407-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammatory disorder of 
      the esophagus, evokes recurrent dysphagia. Endoscopy is often unremarkable, and 
      no consensus exists regarding management of resultant dysphagia. The response of 
      a series of patients with primary eosinophilic esophagitis to dilation is 
      reported together with a description of a possibly pathognomonic sign: fragile 
      esophageal mucosa, for which the term "crepe-paper" mucosa is introduced. 
      METHODS: Five men underwent endoscopy because of dysphagia confirmed (clinically, 
      endoscopically, and histologically) to be caused by primary eosinophilic 
      esophagitis and were treated by bouginage. OBSERVATIONS: All patients had 
      extremely fragile, inelastic, and delicate mucosa, which tore easily even with 
      minor trauma. After the procedure, patients remained asymptomatic for 3 to 24 
      months. CONCLUSIONS: Primary eosinophilic esophagitis is characterized by fragile 
      esophageal mucosa that readily tears in response to minor trauma during otherwise 
      uneventful diagnostic endoscopy. This "crepe-paper" sign may alert endoscopists 
      to the presence of the disease when other mucosal alterations are lacking. 
      Dilation is effective for patients with symptoms with minimal morbidity, despite 
      development of disquieting lesions in response to the procedure.
