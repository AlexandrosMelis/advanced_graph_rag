TI  - Increased neutrophil migratory activity after major trauma: a factor in the 
      etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome?
PG  - 1717-21
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neutrophil infiltration of the lung is characteristic of early 
      posttraumatic acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This study examines the 
      ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood 
      of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. 
      Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients 
      who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of 
      neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that 
      enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early 
      postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the 
      etiology of ARDS. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: University 
      Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. 
      Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology. PATIENTS: Adult 
      blunt trauma victims with Injury Severity Score > or = 18. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN 
      RESULTS: Neutrophils were isolated from citrated blood from 17 adult blunt major 
      trauma patients at admission (0 hrs) and 8 and 24 hrs later. Identical samples 
      were obtained from normal laboratory volunteers (n = 9). The neutrophil count in 
      each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous 
      tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 
      10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in 
      the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated 
      significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. 
      Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to 
      concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when 
      compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p <.05). Neutrophils 
      isolated from major trauma patients exhibited an enhanced migratory response to 
      high concentrations of interleukin-8 throughout the first 24 hrs of admission, in 
      contrast to the normal physiologic attenuation of migration seen in neutrophils 
      isolated from normal laboratory volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that 
      major blunt trauma enhances the migratory capacity of circulating neutrophils. 
      This is manifest within 2 hrs of admission and may be attributable to alteration 
      in interleukin-8 receptor expression, affinity, or downstream signaling. In 
      patients who later develop ARDS, initially elevated circulating neutrophil counts 
      decrease rapidly, over the same time course. Early enhanced neutrophil migratory 
      activity coupled with elevated pulmonary concentrations of interleukin-8 may be 
      central to the establishment of the neutrophil infiltration that is 
      characteristic of ARDS.
