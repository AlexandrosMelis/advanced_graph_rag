AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the feasibility and assess the clinical 
      outcomes associated with an early extubation strategy for all children undergoing 
      congenital heart surgery, including neonates (age, <30 days). METHODS: We 
      performed a linked database analysis of all patients undergoing congenital heart 
      surgery from July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012. We collected data on the cardiac 
      diagnoses, preoperative status, procedure, and postoperative course, including 
      the duration of invasive and noninvasive ventilation, failure of extubation, 
      hemodynamic data, length of stay, complications, and mortality. A multivariable 
      model was used to assess the independent factors associated with an inability to 
      extubate within the operating room and with delayed extubation (>24 hours). 
      RESULTS: We operated on 613 children, including 97 neonates. Intraoperative 
      extubation was achieved in 71% of the cases and early extubation (</= 24 hours) was 
      achieved in 89% of the cases. The overall mortality was 1.5% (9 of 613 patients). 
      Early extubation was associated with lower mortality (1% vs 9%, P < .001) and a 
      lower rate of reintubation (4% vs 23%, P < .001) compared with delayed 
      extubation. Notably, 63% of the neonates were extubated within 24 hours, 
      including 67% of arterial switch operations and 54% of total anomalous pulmonary 
      venous return repairs. Norwood operations were the only procedure in which no 
      patient was extubated within the first 24 hours. Multivariable logistic 
      regression demonstrated that the predictors of delayed extubation included 
      preoperative mechanical ventilation, weight < 5 kg, a longer procedure time, and 
      the need for postoperative inotrope support. Implementation of an early 
      extubation strategy was associated with low rates of complications (5.1 per 10 
      procedures), short lengths of intensive care unit stay (median, 1 day; 
      interquartile range, 1-3), and short hospital stays (median, 4 days; 
      interquartile range, 3-6). CONCLUSIONS: Most children undergoing congenital heart 
      surgery can be extubated in the operating room. Most neonates, including many 
      undergoing complex procedures, can be extubated within the first 24 hours after 
      surgery. Early extubation was associated with low morbidity rates and short 
      lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays.
