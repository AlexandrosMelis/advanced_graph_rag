TI  - Blunt trauma in intoxicated patients: is computed tomography of the abdomen 
      always necessary?
PG  - 403-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical examination to detect abdominal injuries has been considered 
      unreliable in alcohol-intoxicated trauma patients. Computed tomography (CT) plays 
      the primary role in these abdominal evaluations. METHODS: We reviewed medical 
      records of all blunt trauma patients admitted to our trauma service from January 
      1, 1992, to March 31, 1998. Study patients had a blood alcohol level > or =80 
      mg/dL, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 15, and unremarkable abdominal 
      examination. RESULTS: Of 324 patients studied, 317 (98%) had CT scans negative 
      for abdominal injury. Abdominal injuries were identified in 7 patients (2%), with 
      only 2 (0.6%) requiring abdominal exploration. A significant association was 
      found between major chest injury and abdominal injury. CONCLUSION: The incidence 
      of abdominal injury in intoxicated, hemodynamically stable, blunt trauma patients 
      with a normal abdominal examination and normal mentation is low. Physical 
      examination and attention to clinical risk factors allow accurate abdominal 
      evaluation without CT.
