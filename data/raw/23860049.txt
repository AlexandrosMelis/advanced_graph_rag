AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the role of clinical assessment with selective use of 
      imaging studies in the management of suspected acute appendicitis in children. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical records of children referred to Emergency Room in 
      2010 for suspected appendicitis were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnostic 
      investigations divided by age and sex were related to pathological findings. 
      Negative appendectomy and complication rates were calculated. RESULTS: 923 
      children needed surgical assessment : In 75.7% of them surgical indication was 
      excluded and 24.3% were admitted to surgical ward for observation. Appendectomy 
      was eventually performed in 137 patients (61.9%), 82.4% of them without any 
      preoperative imaging while 17.6% underwent selective studies, mainly abdominal 
      ultrasonography (14.6%). Imaging was requested twice as frequently in not 
      operated admitted children (39.3%) than in the operated ones (17.5%, P < 0.001). 
      Overall complicated appendicitis rate (peritonitis and abscess) resulted 26.4% 
      and negative appendectomy rate 8.8%. Females older than 10 years presented 
      histologically not-confirmed appendicitis in 22.2% of cases, while the younger 
      ones presented more frequently complicated appendicitis (29.3%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Clinical assessment is the key to diagnose appendicitis. Nevertheless, in girls 
      older than 10 years, selected use of imaging should be implemented to avoid 
      unnecessary appendectomies. Imaging of choice in equivocal cases should be 
      ultrasonography.
