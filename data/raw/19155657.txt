      hypertensive patients?].

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with increased risk for 
      cardiovascular events. We evaluated heart dimensions in hypertensive patients 
      with MetS. STUDY DESIGN: The study included 75 hypertensive patients (34 males, 
      41 females; mean age 51+/-9 years) without coronary artery disease. Patients were 
      evaluated in two groups depending on the presence or absence of MetS. Age- and 
      gender-matched 20 healthy subjects (9 males, 11 females; mean age 50+/-5 years) 
      comprised the control group. The diagnosis of MetS was based on the presence of 
      at least three of five MetS criteria. Hypertension was defined as arterial blood 
      pressure exceeding 140/85 mmHg on three consecutive measurements or the use of 
      antihypertensive drugs. Echocardiographic measurements included interventricular 
      septal thickness, left ventricular internal diameter, posterior wall thickness, 
      aortic diameter, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left 
      ventricular mass. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was present in 32 hypertensive 
      patients (42.7%; 18 males, 14 females). The mean number of MetS criteria was 
      2.6+/-1.0 in the hypertensive group. Compared to the control group, patients with 
      or without MetS exhibited significantly increased interventricular septum and 
      posterior wall thickness, left atrial diameter, relative wall thickness, and left 
      ventricular mass (p<0.05). The only significant difference between the two 
      patient groups was that MetS was associated with a greater left atrial diameter 
      (p=0.019). Left atrial diameter was correlated with the number of MetS criteria 
      (r=0.51; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Left ventricular dimensions are not influenced by 
      MetS. Rather than MetS, hypertension is primarily responsible for changes in left 
      ventricular dimensions. However, left atrial enlargement is more prominent in 
      patients with MetS, suggesting that each MetS criterion contributes to left 
      ventricular diastolic dysfunction.
