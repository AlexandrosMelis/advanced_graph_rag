AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study evaluated the effect of telmisartan on the livers of 
      diabetic rats and also aimed to determine the hepatic distribution and role of 
      transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) in diabetes-related hepatic 
      degeneration while taking into account the possible protective effects of 
      telmisartan. METHODS: Fifteen adult male rats were used and divided into three 
      groups: the non-diabetic healthy group, alloxan-induced diabetic control group, 
      and the alloxan-induced diabetic telmisartan group. The non-diabetic healthy 
      group and the diabetic control group were exposed to saline for 30 days, while 
      the group treated with diabetic drugs was orally administered telmisartan for 30 
      days (10 mg/kg/day). At the end of the experiment, the rats were sacrificed and 
      the livers were dissected and transferred into the fixation solution. The livers 
      were then evaluated using stereological and histopathological methods. RESULTS: 
      Our study of the numerical density of hepatocytes shows a significant difference 
      between the diabetic control group and diabetic rats treated with telmisartan. 
      Immunohistochemical staining for TGF-beta in liver sections of the diabetic rats 
      treated with telmisartan showed no immunoreactivity. The diabetic control group 
      was determined to be strongly immunoreactive to TGF-beta. CONCLUSION: Results 
      suggest that telmisartan may reduce type-I diabetes mellitus-induced hepatic 
      injury by suppressing activated hepatic stellate cells through concomitant 
      TGF-beta1 down-regulation.
