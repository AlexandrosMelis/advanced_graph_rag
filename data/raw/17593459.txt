TI  - Is double-balloon enteroscopy an accurate method to diagnose small-bowel 
      disorders?
PG  - 2231-6
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyze the contribution 
      of the double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) for diagnosis of the small bowel 
      disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients (20 women, 24 men; mean age 
      53.5 years-old, range 21-89 years) with chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, 
      diarrhea, polyposis, weight-loss, Roux-en-Y surgery, and other indications 
      underwent DBE. RESULTS: Twenty patients had occult or obscure gastrointestinal 
      bleeding. The source of bleeding was identified in 15/20 (75%): multiple 
      angiodysplasias in four, arterial-venous malformation beyond the ligament of 
      Treitz in two that could be treated with injection successfully. Other diagnoses 
      included: duodenal adenocarcinoma, jejunal tuberculosis, erosions and ulcer of 
      the jejunum. Of 24 patients with other indications, the diagnosis could be 
      achieved in 18 of them (75%), including: two lymphomas, plasmocytoma, Gardner's 
      syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers' syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Behcet's 
      disease, jejunal submucosal lesion, lymphangiectasia due to blastomycosis and 
      unspecific chronic jejunitis. Of three cases with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, two 
      underwent DBE in order to perform biopsies of the excluded duodenum. 
      Additionally, two patients underwent DBE to exclude Crohn's disease and lymphoma 
      of the small bowel. The mean length of small bowel examination was 240 +/- 50 cm 
      during a single approach. The diagnostic yield was 75% (33/44 cases) and 
      therapeutic yield was 63.6%. No major complications were observed, only minor 
      complication such as sore throat in 4/44 (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. DBE is a safe 
      and and accurate method to diagnose small bowel disorders; 2. this method permits 
      chromoscopy, biopsies and treatment of the lesions.
