AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that early antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
      initiation results in significant HIV transmission reduction. This is the 
      rationale behind the "test and treat" policy of the World Health Organization 
      (WHO). Implementation of this policy will lead to an increased incidence of 
      ART-related adverse effects, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Is the 
      region yet ready to cope with such a challenging issue? MAIN BODY: The 
      introduction and widespread use of ART have drastically changed the natural 
      history of HIV/AIDS, but exposure to ART leads to serious medication-related 
      adverse effects mainly explained by mitochondrial toxicities, and the situation 
      will get worse in the near future. Indeed, ART is associated with an increased 
      risk of developing cardiovascular disease, lipodystrophy, prediabetes and overt 
      diabetes, insulin resistance and hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis. The prevalence 
      of these disorders is already high in SSA, and the situation will be exacerbated 
      by the implementation of the new WHO recommendations. Most SSA countries are 
      characterized by (extreme) poverty, very weak health systems, inadequate and low 
      quality of health services, inaccessibility to existing health facilities, lack 
      of (qualified) health personnel, lack of adequate equipment, inaccessibility and 
      unaffordability of medicines, and heavy workload in a context of a double burden 
      of disease. Additionally, there is dearth of data on the incidence and predictive 
      factors of ART-related adverse effects in SSA, to anticipate on strategies that 
      should be put in place to prevent the occurrence of these conditions or properly 
      estimate the upcoming burden and prepare an adequate response plan. These are 
      required if we are to anticipate and effectively prevent this upcoming burden. 
      CONCLUSION: While SSA would be the first region to experience the huge benefits 
      of implementing the "test and treat" policy of the WHO, the region is not yet 
      prepared to manage the consequential increased burden of ART-related toxic and 
      metabolic complications. Urgent measures should be taken to fill the lacunae if 
      SSA is not to become over-burdened by the consequences of the "test and treat" 
      policy.
