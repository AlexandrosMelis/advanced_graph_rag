AB  - PURPOSE: The optimal age at which to perform orchiopexy for cryptorchidism has 
      long been debated. The aim of this study was to determine if age at orchiopexy 
      affected testicular atrophy. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients 
      undergoing orchiopexy from 2000 to 2010 was conducted. An individual testis, 
      rather than patient, was used as the dependent variable. A total of 349 testicles 
      from 1126 charts (ICD-9=752.51) were identified. Primary study outcome was 
      testicular survival without atrophy. RESULTS: Mean follow up for the study was 25 
      months. There was postoperative atrophy in 27 testes (7.7%). Intraabdominal 
      testicle was independently associated with increased postsurgical atrophy 
      (p<0.0001). The odds of postsurgical atrophy were 15.66 times higher for an 
      abdominal vs. inguinal location (95% CI: 5.5-44.6). Testicular atrophy was 
      highest for orchiopexy at ages 13-24 months (n=16 of 133, 12%) vs. those less 
      than 13 months (n=3 of 64, 5%), and those greater than 24 months (n=8 of 152, 5%) 
      (p=0.0024). After adjusting for location, age was not statistically significant 
      with postsurgical atrophy (p=0.055). CONCLUSIONS: From this study we conclude 
      that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.
