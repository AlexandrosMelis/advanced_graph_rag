AB  - PURPOSE: Misty mesentery appearance is commonly reported in daily practice, 
      usually as a secondary finding of various pathological entities, but sometimes it 
      is encountered as an isolated finding that cannot be attributed to any other 
      disease entity. We aimed to assess the prevalence of cases with incidentally 
      detected idiopathic misty mesentery on computed tomography (CT) and to summarize 
      the pathologies leading to this appearance. METHODS: Medical records and initial 
      and follow-up CT features of patients with misty mesentery appearance between 
      January 2011 and January 2013 were analysed. The study included cases with no 
      known cause of misty mesentery according to associated CT findings, clinical 
      history, or biochemical manifestations, and excluded patients with diseases known 
      to cause misty mesentery, lymph nodes greater than a short-axis diameter of 5 mm, 
      discrete mesenteric masses, or bowel wall thickening. RESULTS: There were a total 
      of 561 patients in whom misty mesentery appearance was depicted on abdominopelvic 
      CT scans. A total of 80 cases were found to have isolated incidental idiopathic 
      misty mesentery, giving a prevalence of 7%. The common indication for CT 
      examination was abdominal pain. There was a slight female predominance (51.3%). 
      67.5% of all patients were classified as obese and 17.5% as overweight. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that idiopathic incidental 
      misty mesentery appearance has a significant prevalence. Also, the high body mass 
      index of these patients and the growing evidence of obesity-induced inflammatory 
      changes in adipose tissue are suggestive of an association between obesity and 
      misty mesentery appearance on CT.
