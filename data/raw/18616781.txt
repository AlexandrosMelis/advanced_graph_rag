AB  - BACKGROUND: Pigmentary dilution is observed in patients with homocystinuria. 
      Therefore, it is possible that an increase of local homocysteine (Hcy) interferes 
      with normal melanogenesis and plays a role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. 
      Vitamin B12 and folic acid, levels of which are decreased in vitiligo, are 
      important cofactors in the metabolism of Hcy. Consequently, a nutritional 
      deficiency in either of these two vitamins will result in an increase in 
      homocysteine in the circulation, a finding that we expect to find in vitiligo. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of Hcy in the blood of patients with vitiligo 
      as a first step in revealing if it has any relationship with the pathogenesis of 
      vitiligo and consequently if this will have an impact on the treatment of 
      vitiligo. METHODS: Twenty-six patients of both sexes with vitiligo (age range 
      20-50 years, mean 31.4 +/- 8.09) and 26 age-matched healthy controls were 
      included in the study. After excluding factors that may affect serum Hcy levels, 
      blood samples from patients and controls were obtained for homocysteine 
      determination by enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: The mean serum level of Hcy was 
      significantly higher in patients with vitiligo than in controls (21.61 +/- 13.28 
      vs. 13.1 +/- 4.88 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). The Hcy level was significantly 
      higher in male patients than in female patients (28.67 +/- 15.95 vs. 15.56 +/- 
      6.2 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001) and in male controls compared with female controls 
      (15.07 +/- 4.61 vs. 12.05 +/- 4.82 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). The homocysteine 
      level was related to the activity of vitiligo and was significantly higher in 
      patients with progressive disease than in controls (25.4 +/- 14.99 vs. 13.1 +/- 
      4.88 micromol L(-1); P < 0.001). No significant difference in Hcy levels was 
      found between either untreated vitiligo patients (22.77 +/- 13.36 micromol L(-1)) 
      or patients receiving ultraviolet therapy (20.45 +/- 13.73 micromol L(-1)) and 
      the total patient group (21.62 +/- 13.28 micromol L(-1)). CONCLUSION: An elevated 
      homocysteine level may be a precipitating factor for vitiligo in predisposed 
      individuals. In view of the biological role of vitamin B(12) and folic acid in 
      Hcy metabolism, we present our recommendations regarding the investigation and 
      treatment of this common disease.
