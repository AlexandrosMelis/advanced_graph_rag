TI  - Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology 
      (IT) innovation in primary care?
PG  - 3-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent evaluations of IT innovations in primary care have 
      highlighted variations between centres and practices in uptake and use. We 
      evaluated whether structural characteristics of a general practice were 
      associated with variations in use of a web-based clinical information system 
      underpinning a Managed Clinical Network in diabetes, between the years 2001 and 
      2003. METHODS: Using a computerised audit trail, we calculated the numbers of 
      web-based operations that occurred in each practice, stratified by staff type and 
      year, and adjusted for the numbers of registered diabetic patients. In regression 
      analyses, we determined whether total use was associated with structural 
      characteristics of the practice (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs 
      (general practitioners), mean age of the GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of 
      deprivation of the population and whether staff had received advanced training in 
      diabetes care). RESULTS: Initially there were a few practices which made very 
      frequent use of the information system, with relatively high numbers of practices 
      using the facility infrequently. However, overall use gradually became more 
      evenly spread. This effect was particularly evident among nurse users. Frequent 
      use by GPs was evident in only a small number of practices, with mean GP use 
      decreasing over the three years. In linear regression analyses, none of the 
      general practice variables were associated with online use, either overall or 
      stratified by staff type, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This 
      was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not 
      associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced 
      by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes 
      system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond 
      initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.
