TI  - Does angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) gene polymorphism lead to chronic 
      kidney disease among hypertensive patients?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is one of the important contributing factors linked with 
      both causation and development of kidney disease. It is a multifactorial, 
      polygenic, and complex disorder due to interaction of several risk genes with 
      environmental factors. The present study was aimed to explore genetic 
      polymorphism in ACE-1 gene as a risk factor for CKD among hypertensive patients. 
      METHODS: Three hundred patients were enrolled in the study. Ninety were 
      hypertensive patients with CKD taken as cases, whereas 210 hypertensive patients 
      without CKD were taken as controls. Demographic data including age, sex, Body 
      mass index (BMI), and other risk factors were also recorded. DNA was extracted 
      from blood by salting out method. Genotyping of ACE gene was done by PCR 
      technique. All the statistical analysis was done by using Epi Info and SPSS 
      version 16 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). RESULTS: Mean age was higher in the 
      control group (p < 0.05). Variables among two groups were compared out of which 
      age, BMI, hemoglobin (Hb) was found to be statistically significant whereas other 
      variables like systolic blood pressure, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein 
      were not. Blood urea and serum creatinine levels were statistically significant 
      in the two genotypes (p < 0.05). Total and HDL cholesterol were statistically 
      significant for DD genotype of ACE gene (OR = 1.42, 95% CI = 0.72-2.81). 
      Similarly, the risk for CKD among hypertensive patients was also associated with 
      D allele of ACE gene (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 0.86-1.79). CONCLUSION: It is concluded 
      that ACE-DD genotype may be a risk factor for the causation and development of 
      chronic kidney failure among hypertensive patients.
