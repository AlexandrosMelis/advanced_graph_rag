AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some studies suggest that open access articles are more often cited 
      than non-open access articles. However, the relationship between open access and 
      citations count in a discipline such as intensive care medicine has not been 
      studied to date. The present article analyzes the effect of open access 
      publishing of scientific articles in intensive care medicine journals in terms of 
      citations count. METHODS: We evaluated a total of 161 articles (76% being 
      non-open access articles) published in Intensive Care Medicine in the year 2008. 
      Citation data were compared between the two groups up until April 30, 2011. 
      Potentially confounding variables for citation counts were adjusted for in a 
      linear multiple regression model. RESULTS: The median number (interquartile 
      range) of citations of non-open access articles was 8 (4-12) versus 9 (6-18) in 
      the case of open access articles (p=0.084). In the highest citation range (>8), 
      the citation count was 13 (10-16) and 18 (13-21) (p=0.008), respectively. The 
      mean follow-up was 37.5 +/- 3 months in both groups. In the 30-35 months after 
      publication, the average number (mean +/- standard deviation) of citations per 
      article per month of non-open access articles was 0.28 +/- 0.6 versus 0.38 +/- 0.7 in 
      the case of open access articles (p=0.043). Independent factors for citation 
      advantage were the Hirsch index of the first signing author (beta=0.207; p=0.015) 
      and open access status (beta=3.618; p=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Open access publishing 
      and the Hirsch index of the first signing author increase the impact of 
      scientific articles. The open access advantage is greater for the more highly 
      cited articles, and appears in the 30-35 months after publication.
