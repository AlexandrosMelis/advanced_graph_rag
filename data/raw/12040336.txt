TI  - Cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction in elderly patients: 
      does admission to a tertiary center improve survival?
PG  - 768-76
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of early revascularization among patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock remains controversial. 
      Angioplasty registries, while suggesting a benefit, are subject to selection 
      bias, and clinical trials have been underpowered to detect early benefits. If an 
      invasive strategy is beneficial in this population, patients admitted to 
      hospitals with onsite coronary revascularization might be expected to have a 
      better prognosis. We sought to determine whether access to cardiovascular 
      resources at the admitting hospital influenced the prognosis of patients with 
      acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock. METHODS: By use of 
      the Cooperative Cardiovascular Project database (a retrospective medical record 
      review of Medicare patients discharged with acute myocardial infarction), we 
      identified patients aged > or =65 years whose myocardial infarction was 
      complicated by cardiogenic shock. RESULTS: Of the 601 patients with cardiogenic 
      shock, 287 (47.8%) were admitted to hospitals without revascularization services 
      and 314 (52.2%) were admitted to hospitals with coronary angioplasty and coronary 
      artery bypass surgery facilities. Clinical characteristics were similar across 
      the subgroups. Patients admitted to hospitals with revascularization services 
      were more likely to undergo coronary revascularization during the index 
      hospitalization and during the first month after acute myocardial infarction. 
      After adjustment for demographic, clinical, hospital, and treatment strategies, 
      the presence of onsite revascularization services was not associated with a 
      significantly lower 30-day (odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.47, 1.45) or 1-year 
      mortality (odds ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.49, 1.72). CONCLUSIONS: In a community-based 
      cohort, patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic 
      shock did not have significantly different adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality, 
      irrespective of the revascularization capabilities of the admitting hospital.
