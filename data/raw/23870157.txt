AB  - OBJECTIVES: Precursor events are undesirable events that can lead to a subsequent 
      adverse event and have been associated with postoperative mortality. The purpose 
      of the present study was to determine whether precursor events are associated 
      with a composite endpoint of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (death, acute 
      renal failure, stroke, infection) in a low- to medium-risk coronary artery bypass 
      grafting, valve, and valve plus coronary artery bypass grafting population. These 
      events might be targets for strategies aimed at quality improvement. METHODS: The 
      present study was a retrospective cohort design performed at the Queen Elizabeth 
      Health Science Centre. Low- to medium-risk patients who had experienced 
      postoperative MACE were matched 1:1 with patients who had not experienced 
      postoperative MACE. The operative notes, for both groups, were scored by 5 
      surgeons to determine the frequency of 4 precursor events: bleeding, difficulty 
      weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, repair or regrafting, and incomplete 
      revascularization or repair. A univariate comparison of >/=1 precursor events in 
      the matched groups was performed. RESULTS: A total of 311 MACE patients (98.4%) 
      were matched. The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than 
      in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P = .015). The incidence of the individual 
      events of bleeding and difficulty weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass was 
      significantly higher in the MACE group. Those patients with a precursor event in 
      the absence of MACE also appeared to have a greater prevalence of other important 
      postoperative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery who are 
      exposed to intraoperative precursor events were more likely to experience a 
      postoperative MACE. Quality improvement techniques aimed at mitigating the 
      consequences of precursor events might improve the surgical outcomes for cardiac 
      surgical patients.
