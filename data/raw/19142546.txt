TI  - Does quantitative left ventricular regional wall motion change after fibrous 
      tissue resection in endomyocardial fibrosis?
PG  - 17-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We compared left ventricular regional wall motion, the global left 
      ventricular ejection fraction, and the New York Heart Association functional 
      class pre- and postoperatively. INTRODUCTION: Endomyocardial fibrosis is 
      characterized by fibrous tissue deposition in the endomyocardium of the apex 
      and/or inflow tract of one or both ventricles. Although left ventricular global 
      systolic function is preserved, patients exhibit wall motion abnormalities in the 
      apical and inferoapical regions. Fibrous tissue resection in New York Heart 
      Association FC III and IV endomyocardial fibrosis patients has been shown to 
      decrease morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We prospectively studied 30 patients 
      (20 female, 30+/-10 years) before and 5+/-8 months after surgery. The left 
      ventricular ejection fraction was determined using the area-length method. 
      Regional left ventricular motion was measured by the centerline method. Five left 
      ventricular segments were analyzed pre- and postoperatively. Abnormality was 
      expressed in units of standard deviation from the mean motion in a normal 
      reference population. RESULTS: Left ventricular wall motion in the five regions 
      did not differ between pre- and postoperative measurements. Additionally, the 
      left ventricular ejection fraction did not change after surgery (0.45+/-0.13% x 
      0.43+/-0.12% pre- and postoperatively, respectively). The New York Heart 
      Association functional class improved to class I in 40% and class II in 43% of 
      patients postoperatively (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although endomyocardial fibrosis 
      patients have improved clinical symptoms after surgery, the global left 
      ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion in these patients do not 
      change. This finding suggests that other explanations, such as improvements in 
      diastolic function, may be operational.
