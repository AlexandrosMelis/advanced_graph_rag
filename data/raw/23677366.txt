TI  - Do oblique views add value in the diagnosis of spondylolysis in adolescents?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique lumbar spine 
      radiographs are often a standard part of the evaluation of children who are 
      clinically suspected of having spondylolysis. Recent concerns regarding radiation 
      exposure and costs have brought the value of oblique radiographs into question. 
      The purpose of the present study was to determine the diagnostic value of oblique 
      views in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. METHODS: Radiographs of fifty 
      adolescents with L5 spondylolysis without spondylolisthesis and fifty controls 
      were retrospectively reviewed. All controls were confirmed not to have 
      spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance 
      imaging, or bone scanning. Anteroposterior, lateral, and right and left oblique 
      radiographs of the lumbar spine were arranged into two sets of slides: one 
      showing four views (anteroposterior, lateral, right oblique, and left oblique) 
      and one showing two views (anteroposterior and lateral only). The slides were 
      randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view 
      slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty 
      random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater 
      agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. 
      Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the 
      percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). 
      PCXMC software was used to generate effective radiation doses. Study charges were 
      determined from radiology billing data. RESULTS: There was no significant 
      difference in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view 
      radiographs in the diagnosis of spondylolysis. The sensitivity was 0.59 for 
      two-view studies and 0.53 for four-view studies (p = 0.33). The specificity was 
      0.96 for two-view studies and 0.94 for four-view studies (p = 0.60). Inter-rater 
      agreement, intra-rater agreement, and agreement with gold-standard ICC values 
      were in the moderate range and also demonstrated no significant differences. 
      Percent overall agreement was 78% for four-view studies and 82% for two-view 
      studies. The radiation effective dose was 1.26 mSv for four-view studies and 0.72 
      mSv for two-view studies (difference, 0.54 mSv). The charge for four-view studies 
      was $145 more than that for two-view studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference 
      in sensitivity and specificity between four-view and two-view studies. Although 
      oblique views have long been considered standard practice by some, our data could 
      not identify a diagnostic benefit that might outweigh the additional cost and 
      radiation exposure.
