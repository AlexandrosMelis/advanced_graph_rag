      surgery outcomes? A pilot randomized study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many insurance payors mandate that bariatric surgery candidates 
      undergo a medically supervised weight management (MSWM) program as a prerequisite 
      for surgery. However, there is little evidence to support this requirement. We 
      evaluated in a randomized controlled trial the hypothesis that participation in a 
      MSWM program does not predict outcomes after laparoscopic adjustable gastric 
      banding (LAGB) in a publicly insured population. METHODS: This pilot randomized 
      trial was conducted in a large academic urban public hospital. Patients who met 
      NIH consensus criteria for bariatric surgery and whose insurance did not require 
      a mandatory 6-month MSWM program were randomized to a MSWM program with monthly 
      visits over 6 months (individual or group) or usual care for 6 months and then 
      followed for bariatric surgery outcomes postoperatively. Demographics, weight, 
      and patient behavior scores, including patient adherence, eating behavior, 
      patient activation, and physical activity, were collected at baseline and at 6 
      months (immediately preoperatively and postoperatively). RESULTS: A total of 55 
      patients were enrolled in the study with complete follow-up on 23 patients. 
      Participants randomized to a MSWM program attended an average of 2 sessions 
      preoperatively. The majority of participants were female and non-Caucasian, mean 
      age was 46 years, average income was less than $20,000/year, and most had 
      Medicaid as their primary insurer, consistent with the demographics of the 
      hospital's bariatric surgery program. Data analysis included both 
      intention-to-treat and completers' analyses. No significant differences in weight 
      loss and most patient behaviors were found between the two groups 
      postoperatively, suggesting that participation in a MSWM program did not improve 
      weight loss outcomes for LAGB. Participation in a MSWM program did appear to have 
      a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively. CONCLUSION: MSWM does not 
      appear to confer additional benefit as compared to the standard preoperative 
      bariatric surgery protocol in terms of weight loss and most behavioral outcomes 
      after LAGB in our patient population.
