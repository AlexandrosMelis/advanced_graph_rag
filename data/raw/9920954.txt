TI  - Do "America's Best Hospitals" perform better for acute myocardial infarction?
PG  - 286-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: "America's Best Hospitals," an influential list published annually by 
      U.S. News and World Report, assesses the quality of hospitals. It is not known 
      whether patients admitted to hospitals ranked at the top in cardiology have lower 
      short-term mortality from acute myocardial infarction than those admitted to 
      other hospitals or whether differences in mortality are explained by differential 
      use of recommended therapies. METHODS: Using data from the Cooperative 
      Cardiovascular Project on 149,177 elderly Medicare beneficiaries with acute 
      myocardial infarction in 1994 or 1995, we examined the care and outcomes of 
      patients admitted to three types of hospitals: those ranked high in cardiology 
      (top-ranked hospitals); hospitals not in the top rank that had on-site facilities 
      for cardiac catheterization, coronary angioplasty, and bypass surgery (similarly 
      equipped hospitals); and the remaining hospitals (non-similarly equipped 
      hospitals). We compared 30-day mortality; the rates of use of aspirin, 
      beta-blockers, and reperfusion; and the relation of differences in rates of 
      therapy to short-term mortality. RESULTS: Admission to a top-ranked hospital was 
      associated with lower adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.87; 95 percent 
      confidence interval, 0.76 to 1.00; P=0.05 for top-ranked hospitals vs. the 
      others). Among patients without contraindications to therapy, top-ranked 
      hospitals had significantly higher rates of use of aspirin (96.2 percent, as 
      compared with 88.6 percent for similarly equipped hospitals and 83.4 percent for 
      non-similarly equipped hospitals; P<0.01) and beta-blockers (75.0 percent vs. 
      61.8 percent and 58.7 percent, P<0.01), but lower rates of reperfusion therapy 
      (61.0 percent vs. 70.7 percent and 65.6 percent, P=0.03). The survival advantage 
      associated with admission to top-ranked hospitals was less strong after we 
      adjusted for factors including the use of aspirin and beta-blockers (odds ratio, 
      0.94; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.08; P=0.38). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Admission to a hospital ranked high on the list of "America's Best Hospitals" was 
      associated with lower 30-day mortality among elderly patients with acute 
      myocardial infarction. A substantial portion of the survival advantage may be 
      associated with these hospitals' higher rates of use of aspirin and beta-blocker 
      therapy.
