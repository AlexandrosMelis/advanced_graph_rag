      radical mastoidectomy?

AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful 
      treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease 
      comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows 
      easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion 
      rate to open mastoidectomy. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to report the 
      rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary CAT surgery and 
      to report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. METHODS: 
      This was a retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012. 
      RESULTS: In total 132 second-look operations were undertaken, with a mean 
      interval between primary surgery and second-look procedures of 6 months. The rate 
      of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual 
      disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with 
      cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease. Residual disease was defined 
      as cholesteatoma present behind an intact tympanic membrane. The majority of 
      recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (73.1%). Only 
      four cases were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy (3%) and three 
      cases required a third-look procedure.
