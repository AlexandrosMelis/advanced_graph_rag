TI  - Do ventricular arrhythmias in athletes subside over time?
PG  - 485-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sudden death in athletes can occur during sport activities and is 
      presumably related to ventricular arrhythmias. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the 
      long-term follow-up ofathletes with ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise 
      test. METHODS: From a database of 56,462 athletes we identified 192 athletes (35 
      years old who had ventricular arrhythmias during an exercise test. Ninety 
      athletes had > or =3 ventricular premature beats (VPB) (group A) and 102 athletes 
      had ventricular couplets or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during an 
      exercise test (group B). A control group of 92 athletesfrom without ventricular 
      arrhythmias was randomly seleclted from the database (group C). Of the 192 
      athletes 39 returnied for a repeat exercise test after a mean follow-up period of 
      70 +/- 25 months and they constitute the study population. RESULTS: Twelve 
      athletes from group A, 21 fromgroup B and 6 from group C returned for a repeat 
      exercise test. The athletes reached a significantly lower peak heart rate during 
      their follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). More athletes were engaged in 
      competitive sports during their initialexercise test than in the follow-up test 
      (P = 0.021). Most of theathletes who had VPB and/orventricular couplets and/or 
      NSVT during their initial exercise test had far fewer ventricular arrhythmias in 
      the follow-up exercise test (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Athletes engaged in 
      competitive sports are more likely to develop ventricular arrhythmias during 
      exercise. These arrhythmias subside over time when athletes are engaged in 
      non-competitive sports.
