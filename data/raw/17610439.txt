TI  - Do hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends?
PG  - 1589-612
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of a weekend hospitalization on the timing and 
      incidence of intensive cardiac procedures, and on subsequent expenditures, 
      mortality and readmission rates for Medicare patients hospitalized with acute 
      myocardial infarction (AMI). DATA SOURCES: The primary data are longitudinal, 
      administrative claims for 922,074 elderly, non-rural, fee-for-service Medicare 
      beneficiaries hospitalized with AMI from 1989 to 1998. Annual patient-level 
      cohorts provide information on ex ante health status, procedure use, 
      expenditures, and health outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: The patient is the primary unit 
      of analysis. I use ordinary least squares regression to estimate the effect of 
      weekend hospitalization on rates of cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, and 
      bypass surgery (in various time periods subsequent to the initial 
      hospitalization), 1-year expenditures and rates of adverse health outcomes in 
      various periods following the AMI admission. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Weekend AMI 
      patients are significantly less likely to receive immediate intensive cardiac 
      procedures, and experience significantly higher rates of adverse health outcomes. 
      Weekend admission leads to a 3.47 percentage point reduction in catheterization 
      at 1 day, a 1.52 point reduction in angioplasty, and a 0.35 point reduction in 
      by-pass surgery (p<.001 in all cases). The primary effect is delayed treatment, 
      as weekend-weekday procedure differentials narrow over time from the initial 
      hospitalization. Weekend patients experience a 0.38 percentage point (p<.001) 
      increase in 1-year mortality and a 0.20 point (p<.001) increase in 1-year 
      readmission with congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Weekend hospitalization 
      leads to delayed provision of intensive procedures and elevated 1-year mortality 
      for elderly AMI patients. The existence of measurable differences in treatments 
      raises questions regarding the efficacy of a single input regulation (e.g., 
      mandated nurse staffing ratios) in enhancing the quality of weekend care. My 
      results suggest that targeted financial incentives might be a more cost-effective 
      policy response than broad regulation aimed at improving quality.
