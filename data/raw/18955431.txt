AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the secondary benefits of treadmill training for people in 
      the chronic stage of recovery from stroke. DESIGN: Modified random assignment, 
      matched-pair control group design with repeated measures. SETTING: Outpatient 
      stroke centre. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty individuals post first stroke who 
      acknowledged walking slower than pre stroke. Participants matched by side of 
      hemiparesis and motor impairment. INTERVENTIONS: Twelve 20-minute sessions of 
      walking on a treadmill or weekly phone call. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression 
      (Beck Depression Index), mobility and social participation (Stroke Impact Scale 
      3.0 subscales) were assessed initially, at the end of 12 treatments (four weeks) 
      and six weeks later. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between groups 
      for any dependent measure. The ANOVA to investigate main effects in each group 
      found no significant findings in the control group; however in the treatment 
      group significant improvements over time for depression (P = 0.005, P < 0.001), 
      mobility (P = 0.008) and social participation (P = 0.004) were demonstrated. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A task-specific intervention designed to improve gait speed may 
      potentially provide secondary benefits by positively impacting depression, 
      mobility and social participation for people post stroke.
