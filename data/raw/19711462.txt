TI  - Standardizing care in medical oncology: are Web-based systems the answer?
PG  - 5579-88

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical oncology is embracing information technology to standardize 
      care and improve patient outcomes, with a range of Web-based systems used 
      internationally. The authors' aim was to determine the factors affecting the 
      uptake and use of a Web-based protocol system for medical oncology in the 
      Australian setting. METHODS: The authors conducted 50 interviews and observed 
      medical oncology physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in their treatment setting 
      at 6 hospitals in different geographic locations. RESULTS: The Web-based system 
      plays a major role in guiding oncology treatment across participating sites. 
      However, its use varies according to hospital location, clinician roles, and 
      experience. A range of issues impact on clinicians' attitudes toward and use of 
      the Web-based system. Important factors are clinician-specific (eg, their need 
      for autonomy and perceptions of lack of time) or environmental (eg, hospital 
      policy on protocol use, endorsement of the system, and the availability of 
      appropriate infrastructure, such as sufficient computers). The level of education 
      received regarding the system was also found to be integral to its ongoing use. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although the provision of high-quality evidence-based resources, 
      electronic or otherwise, is essential for standardizing care and improving 
      patient outcomes, the authors' findings demonstrate that this alone does not 
      ensure uptake. It is important to understand end-users, the environment in which 
      they operate, and the basic infrastructure required to implement such a system. 
      Implementation must also be accompanied by continuing education and endorsement 
      to ensure both long-term sustainability and use of the system to its full 
      potential.
