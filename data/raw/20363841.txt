TI  - Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers?
PG  - 1345-53
LID - 10.1378/chest.09-2681 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against spirometry 
      in the absence of symptoms. However, as much as 50% of COPD cases in the United 
      States remain undiagnosed. METHODS: Report of symptoms, smoking history, and 
      spirometric data were collected from subjects screened for a work-related medical 
      evaluation (N = 3,955). Prevalence of airflow obstruction and respiratory 
      symptoms were assessed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 
      predictive values, and relative risks of predicting symptoms and smoking history 
      for COPD were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of smokers in our sample 
      had airways obstruction (AO). Of these, 36% reported a diagnosis of or treatment 
      for COPD. Odds ratio (95% CI) for AO with smoking (> or = 20 pack-years) was 3.73 
      (3.12- 4.45), 1.98 (1.73-2.27) for cough, 1.79 (1.55-2.08) for dyspnea, 1.95 
      (1.70-2.34) for sputum, and 2.59 (2.26-2.97) for wheeze. Respiratory symptoms 
      were reported by 92% of smokers with AO, 86% smokers with restriction, 76% 
      smokers with normal spirometry, and 73% of nonsmokers. Sensitivity (92% vs 90%), 
      specificity (19% vs 22%), positive (47% vs 40%) and negative (75% vs 80%) 
      predictive values for the presence of one or more symptoms were similar between 
      smokers and all subjects. CONCLUSIONS: COPD is underdiagnosed in the United 
      States. Symptoms are frequent in subjects with AO and increase their risk for 
      COPD, but add little beyond age and smoking history to the predictive value of 
      spirometry. In view of the high prevalence of symptoms and their poor predictive 
      value, a simpler and more effective approach would be to screen older smokers.
