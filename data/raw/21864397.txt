      alone: does combined modality treatment benefit?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with lung metastasis alone has been 
      reported as a relatively favorable prognostic group, and combined modality 
      treatment might be indicated for selected cases. However, the prognostic factors 
      determining survival of this group and the indication of combined therapy have 
      not been thoroughly studied. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 246 patients of 
      NPC with lung metastasis(es) alone presented at diagnosis or as the first failure 
      after primary treatment from 1993 to 2008 in an academic tertiary hospital. 
      Univariate and multivariate survival analyses of post-metastasis survival (PMS) 
      and overall survival (OS) were carried out to determine the prognostic factors. 
      RESULTS: The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year of PMS and OS for the whole cohort were 
      34.3%, 17.0%, 8.6% and 67.8%, 45.4%, 18.5%, respectively. The median PMS (45.6 
      months vs. 23.7 months) and OS (73.7 months vs. 46.2 months) of patients treated 
      with combined therapy was significantly longer than that of those treated with 
      chemotherapy alone (P < 0.001). Age, disease-free interval (DFI) and treatment 
      modality were evaluated as independent prognostic factors of OS, while only age 
      and treatment modality retain their independent significance in PMS analysis. In 
      stratified survival analysis, compared to chemotherapy alone, combined therapy 
      could benefit the patients with DFI > 1 year, but not those with DFI </= 1 year. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Age </= 45 years, DFI > 1 year, and the combined therapy were good 
      prognostic factors for NPC patients with lung metastasis(es) alone. The 
      combination of local therapy and the basic chemotherapy should be considered for 
      these patients with DFI > 1 year.
