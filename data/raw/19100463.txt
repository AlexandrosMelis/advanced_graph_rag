AB  - BACKGROUND: Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressive drug used in organ 
      transplantation. Because of its substantial toxic effects, narrow therapeutic 
      index, and interindividual pharmacokinetic variability, therapeutic drug 
      monitoring of whole-blood tacrolimus concentrations has been recommended. We 
      investigated the comparability of the results of 2 immunoassay systems, affinity 
      column-mediated immunoassay (ACMIA) and microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA), 
      comparing differences in the tacrolimus concentrations measured by the 2 methods 
      in relation to the hematologic and biochemical values of hepatic and renal 
      functions. METHODS: A total of 154 samples from kidney or liver transplant 
      recipients were subjected to Dimension RxL HM with a tacrolimus Flex reagent 
      cartilage for the ACMIA method and IMx tacrolimus II for the MEIA method. 
      RESULTS: Tacrolimus concentrations measured by the ACMIA method (n = 154) closely 
      correlated with those measured by the MEIA method (r = 0.84). The Bland-Altman 
      plot using concentration differences between the 2 methods and the average of the 
      2 methods showed no specific trends. The tacrolimus levels determined by both the 
      MEIA method and the ACMIA method were not influenced by hematocrit levels, but 
      the difference between the 2 methods (ACMIA - MEIA) tended to be larger in low 
      hematocrit samples (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The ACMIA method used for a tacrolimus 
      assay is precise and has advantages, including the lack of a required 
      pretreatment procedure. Furthermore, it is only slightly influenced by the 
      hematologic or biochemical status of the samples.
