AB  - OBJECTIVES: Female citizens of Sami (the indigenous people of Norway) 
      municipalities in northern Norway have a low risk of breast cancer. The objective 
      of this study was to describe the attendance rate and outcome of the Norwegian 
      Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in the Sami-speaking municipalities and a 
      control group. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective registry-based study. METHODS: The 8 
      municipalities included in the administration area of the Sami language law 
      (Sami) were matched with a control group of 11 municipalities (non-Sami). 
      Population data were accessed from Statistics Norway. Data regarding invitations 
      and outcome in the NBCSP during the period 2001-2010 was derived from the Cancer 
      Registry of Norway (CRN). The NBCSP targets women aged 50-69 years. Rates and 
      percentages were compared using chi-square test with a p-value<0.05 as 
      statistical significant. RESULTS: The attendance rate in the NBCSP was 78% in the 
      Sami and 75% in the non-Sami population (p< 0.01). The recall rates were 2.4 and 
      3.3% in the Sami and non-Sami population, respectively (p<0.01). The rate of 
      invasive screen detected cancer was not significantly lower in the Sami group 
      (p=0.14). The percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP among the 
      Sami (67%) was lower compared with the non-Sami population (86%, p=0.06). 
      CONCLUSION: Despite a lower risk of breast cancer, the Sami attended the NBCSP 
      more frequently than the control group. The recall and cancer detection rate was 
      lower among the Sami compared with the non-Sami group.
