AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prostate morphology or technique used has any 
      effect on postoperative outcomes after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data was 
      completed for all patients undergoing a holmium laser enucleation of the prostate 
      at our institution. Prostate morphology was classified as either "bilobar" or 
      "trilobar" according to the cystoscopic appearance. The baseline characteristics, 
      complications, and postoperative outcomes were collected. RESULTS: A total of 304 
      patients with either "bilobar" (n = 142) or "trilobar" (n = 162) prostate 
      morphology were included. The trilobar group was more likely to have longer 
      operative times (112 vs 100 minutes, P = .04), although this difference was not 
      significant on multivariate analysis. The postoperative outcomes were similar 
      between the 2 groups for American Urological Association symptom score, change in 
      American Urological Association symptom score, bother score, maximal flow rate, 
      change in maximal flow rate, postvoid residual urine volume, and complication 
      rate. However, the trilobar group had a significantly greater decrease in their 
      PVR urine volume (296 vs 176 mL, P = .01), a difference that persisted on 
      multivariate analysis. A subset analysis of the trilobar prostates revealed that 
      performing a 2-lobe technique achieved shorter operative and enucleation times, 
      although the difference was not significant. CONCLUSION: Those patients with 
      trilobar prostate morphology are more likely to achieve a greater decrease in the 
      PVR urine volume after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. All other 
      outcomes appeared to be similar between the 2 groups. In addition, a 2-lobe 
      technique can be safely used for trilobar prostates when deemed feasible by the 
      surgeon.
