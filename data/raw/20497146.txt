      optimal time of acid suppression for maximal healing?

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with Los Angeles (LA) grade C or D oesophagitis, a 
      positive relationship has been established between the duration of intragastric 
      acid suppression and healing. AIM: To determine whether there is an apparent 
      optimal time of intragastric acid suppression for maximal healing of reflux 
      oesophagitis. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of data from a proof-of-concept, 
      double-blind, randomized study of 134 adult patients treated with esomeprazole 
      (10 or 40 mg od for 4 weeks) for LA grade C or D oesophagitis. A curve was fitted 
      to pooled 24-h intragastric pH (day 5) and endoscopically assessed healing (4 
      weeks) data using piecewise quadratic logistic regression. RESULTS: Maximal 
      reflux oesophagitis healing rates were achieved when intragastric pH >4 was 
      achieved for approximately 50-70% (12-17 h) of the 24-h period. Acid suppression 
      above this threshold did not yield further increases in healing rates. 
      CONCLUSION: After 4 weeks' acid-suppressive therapy for LA grade C or D 
      oesophagitis, successful healing appears to reach a threshold above which 
      improvements are unlikely to be achieved despite an increase in number of hours 
      with intragastric pH >4.
