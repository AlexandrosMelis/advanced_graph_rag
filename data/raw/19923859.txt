AB  - OBJECTIVE: The present studywas designed to investigate the possible role of T 
      cells in spatial learning ability in mouse after toluene exposure. METHOD: 
      Eight-week-old male wild-type (WT) and nude mice of BALB/c strain were exposed to 
      toluene (0, 9 and 90 ppm) in a nose-only exposure chamber for 30 min per day for 
      3 consecutive days and then once per week for 4 weeks. Twenty-four hours after 
      the completion of exposure, we examined the spatial learning ability in each 
      mouse using the Morris water maze apparatus. RESULTS: In the acquisition phase, a 
      longer escape latency was observed in nude mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene on days 
      3 and 4 when compared with corresponding WT mice. However, the effect of toluene 
      on the escape latency was not significant in nude mice. In the probe trial, WT 
      mice exposed to 90 ppm toluene showed poor retention memory compared with the 
      control group. In the reversal phase, we did not find any significant difference 
      between groups. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that T-cell deficiency may 
      affect spatial learning performance following toluene exposure.
