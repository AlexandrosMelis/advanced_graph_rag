AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the Internet is commonly used to recruit samples in studies 
      of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related risk behaviors, it has not been 
      used to measure patient-reported well-being. As the burden of long-term chronic 
      HIV infection rises, the Internet may offer enormous potential for recruitment to 
      research and interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare two samples of 
      gay men living with HIV, one recruited via the Web and the other recruited in 
      outpatient settings, in terms of self-reported physical and psychological symptom 
      burden. METHODS: The Internet sample was recruited from a UK-wide Web-based 
      survey of gay men with diagnosed HIV. Of these, 154 respondents identified 
      themselves as resident in London and were included in this analysis. The HIV 
      clinic sample was recruited from five HIV outpatient clinics. Of these 
      participants, 400 gay men recruited in London clinics were included in this 
      analysis. RESULTS: The Web-based sample was younger than the clinic sample (37.3 
      years, SD 7.0 vs 40.9 years, SD 8.3), more likely to be in paid employment 
      (72.8%, 99/136 vs 60.1%, 227/378), less likely to be on antiretroviral therapy 
      (ART) (58.4%, 90/154 vs 68.0%, 266/391), and had worse mean psychological symptom 
      burden compared to the clinic sample (mean scores: 1.61, SD 1.09 vs 1.36, SD 
      0.96) but similar physical symptom burden (mean scores: 0.78, SD 0.65 vs 0.70, SD 
      0.74). In multivariable logistic regression, for the physical symptom burden 
      model, adjusted for age, ethnicity, employment status, and ART use, the 
      recruitment setting (ie, Web-based vs clinic) was not significantly associated 
      with high physical symptom score. The only variable that remained significantly 
      associated with high physical symptom score was employment status, with those in 
      employment being less likely to report being in the upper (worst) physical 
      symptom tertile versus the other two tertiles (adjusted OR 0.41, 95% CI 
      0.28-0.62, P<.001). For the psychological symptom burden model, those recruited 
      via the Web were significantly more likely to report being in the upper (worst) 
      tertile (adjusted OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.41-3.44, P=.001). In addition, those in 
      employment were less likely to report being in the upper (worst) psychological 
      symptom tertile compared to those not in employment (adjusted OR 0.32, 95% CI 
      0.21-0.49, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data have revealed a number of differences. 
      Compared to the clinic sample, the Web-based sample had worse psychological 
      symptom burden, younger average age, higher prevalence of employment, and a lower 
      proportion on ART. For future research, we recommend that Web-based data 
      collection should include the demographic variables that we note differed between 
      samples. In addition, we recognize that each recruitment method may bring 
      inherent sampling bias, with clinic populations differing by geographical 
      location and reflecting those accessing regular medical care, and Web-based 
      sampling recruiting those with greater Internet access and identifying survey 
      materials through specific searches and contact with specific websites.
