TI  - Should tumor depth be included in prognostication of soft tissue sarcoma?
PG  - 17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most staging systems for soft tissue sarcoma are based on histologic 
      malignancy-grade, tumor size and tumor depth. These factors are generally 
      dichotomized, size at 5 cm. We believe it is unlikely that tumor depth per se 
      should influence a tumor's metastatic capability. Therefore we hypothesized that 
      the unfavourable prognostic importance of depth could be explained by the close 
      association between size and depth, deep-seated tumors on average being larger 
      than the superficial ones. When tumor size is dichotomized, this effect should be 
      most pronounced in the large size (>5 cm) group in which the size span is larger. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the associations between tumor size and depth and the 
      prognostic importance of grade, size and depth in a population-based series of 
      490 adult patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or trunk wall with 
      complete, 4.5 years minimum, follow-up. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed no 
      major prognostic effect of tumor depth when grade and size were taken into 
      account. The mean size of small tumors was the same whether superficial or deep 
      but the mean size of large and deep-seated tumors were one third larger than that 
      of large but superficial tumors. Tumor depth influenced the prognosis in the 
      subset of high-grade and large tumors. In this subset deep-seated tumors had 
      poorer survival rate than superficial tumors, which could be explained by the 
      larger mean size of the deep-seated tumors. CONCLUSION: Most of the prognostic 
      value of tumor depth in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity or trunk wall can 
      be explained by the association between tumor size and depth.
