AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether pre-eclampsia is a risk 
      factor for cochlear damage and sensorineural hearing impairment. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: This prospective case-control study consisted of 33 patients with 
      pre-eclampsia and 32 normotensive pregnant patients as controls. All of the 
      subjects underwent otoscopic examinations - pure tone audiometry (0.25-16 kHz) 
      and transient evoked otoacoustic emission (1-4 kHz) tests - during their third 
      trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: The mean ages of the patients with pre-eclampsia 
      and the control subjects were 29.6 +/- 5.7 and 28.6 +/- 5.3 years, respectively. The 
      baseline demographic characteristics, including age, gravidity, parity number, 
      and gestational week, were similar between the two patient groups. Hearing 
      thresholds in the right ear at 1, 4, 8, and 10 kHz and in the left ear at 8 and 
      10 kHz were significantly higher in the patients with pre-eclampsia compared to 
      the control subjects. The degree of systolic blood pressure measured at the time 
      of diagnosis had a deteriorating effect on hearing at 8, 10, and 12 kHz in the 
      right ear and at 10 kHz in the left ear. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-eclampsia is a 
      potential risk factor for cochlear damage and sensorineural hearing loss. Further 
      studies that include routine audiological examinations are needed in these 
      patients.
