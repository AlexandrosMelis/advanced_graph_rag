TI  - Are variations in the use of carotid endarterectomy explained by population Need? 
      A study of health service utilisation in two English health regions.
PG  - 501-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: to describe variation in utilisation of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) 
      within two English health regions and explore relationships between use, need and 
      proximity to services. DESIGN: consecutive case series of operations. Comparison 
      at a population level with district stroke mortality, hospital admissions and 
      material deprivation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: standardised utilisation rates for 
      CEA and measures of inter-district variability. Spearman's rank correlation 
      coefficients for associations between variables. RESULTS: variation in 
      utilisation rates was considerable (14-fold difference across district 
      populations). More individuals had bilateral surgery in the Yorkshire region than 
      in the Northern (11.7% vs. 5.5%, p=0.002). There was no association between 
      utilisation rates for CEA and district stroke mortality (r=-0.06, 95% CI -0.41 to 
      0.30) or admission rates for stroke (r=0.17, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.49). There was a 
      strong relationship between residence in districts where services were located 
      and higher utilisation. Rates of CEA were lowest in the regions' most affluent 
      wards. CONCLUSION: use of CEA varies widely, depending on area of residence. 
      Variation is not a consequence of differences in need, but reflects clinical 
      practice and supply of services. There is evidence to suggest unmet need for CEA.
