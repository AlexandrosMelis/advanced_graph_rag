AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the features of PMR that may predict the duration of 
      steroid therapy, the occurrence of relapses and the late development of GCA. 
      METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 176 patients with PMR, followed up for 5 
      years. Baseline factors associated with the duration of steroids therapy were 
      identified using Cox regression. Predictors of relapse and the late development 
      of GCA were identified using binary logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 176 
      patients with PMR were included, of whom 124 stopped steroids within 5 years. The 
      probability of stopping steroids within 5 years was independently reduced by an 
      elevated plasma viscosity (PV) [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29, 0.82 for a 
      PV > or = 2.00 mPa s compared with a PV < or = 1.80 mPa s; overall P = 0.024] and 
      by starting treatment at >15 mg prednisolone (HR = 0.63; 95% CI 0.41, 0.97; P = 
      0.036). Either of these independently reduced the chances of stopping steroids 
      within a given time interval between 27 and 51%. No significant predictors of 
      relapse were identified. Predictors of late GCA on univariable analysis were 
      female sex [odds ratio (OR) = 8.16; 95% CI 1.06, 63.13; P = 0.044], HLA-DRB1*0101 
      or -*0401 alleles (OR = 4.95; 95% CI 1.05, 23.34; P = 0.043), PV > or = 2.00 mPa 
      s compared with PV < or = 1.80 mPa s (OR = 10.64; 95% CI 1.28, 88.38; P = 0.029) 
      and initial prednisolone dose >15 mg (OR = 4.53; 95% CI 1.61, 12.79; P = 0.004). 
      CONCLUSION: A higher PV in PMR increases the risk of prolonged steroid therapy 
      and late GCA. Female sex and particular HLA alleles may increase the risk of late 
      GCA. Starting patients on >15 mg prednisolone is associated with a prolonged 
      steroid duration.
