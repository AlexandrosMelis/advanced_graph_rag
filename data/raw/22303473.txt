AB  - BACKGROUND: Family caregivers of dementia patients are at increased risk of 
      developing depression or anxiety. A multi-component program designed to mobilize 
      support of family networks demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing depressive 
      symptoms in caregivers. However, the impact of an intervention consisting solely 
      of family meetings on depression and anxiety has not yet been evaluated. This 
      study examines the preventive effects of family meetings for primary caregivers 
      of community-dwelling dementia patients. METHODS: A randomized multicenter trial 
      was conducted among 192 primary caregivers of community dwelling dementia 
      patients. Caregivers did not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive or 
      anxiety disorder at baseline. Participants were randomized to the family meetings 
      intervention (n = 96) or usual care (n = 96) condition. The intervention 
      consisted of two individual sessions and four family meetings which occurred once 
      every 2 to 3 months for a year. Outcome measures after 12 months were the 
      incidence of a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder and change in depressive 
      and anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes), caregiver burden and quality of life 
      (secondary outcomes). Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol analyses were 
      performed. RESULTS: A substantial number of caregivers (72/192) developed a 
      depressive or anxiety disorder within 12 months. The intervention was not 
      superior to usual care either in reducing the risk of disorder onset (adjusted 
      IRR 0.98; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.38) or in reducing depressive (randomization-by-time 
      interaction coefficient = -1.40; 95% CI -3.91 to 1.10) or anxiety symptoms 
      (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient = -0.55; 95% CI -1.59 to 0.49). 
      The intervention did not reduce caregiver burden or their health related quality 
      of life. CONCLUSION: This study did not demonstrate preventive effects of family 
      meetings on the mental health of family caregivers. Further research should 
      determine whether this intervention might be more beneficial if provided in a 
      more concentrated dose, when applied for therapeutic purposes or targeted towards 
      subgroups of caregivers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Controlled-Trials.com
