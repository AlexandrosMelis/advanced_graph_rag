      colonization and biofilm formation in vitro?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Implant-related infections represent one of the most severe 
      complications in orthopaedics. A fast-resorbable, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel 
      may reduce or prevent bacterial colonization and biofilm formation of implanted 
      biomaterials. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked: (1) Is a fast-resorbable hydrogel 
      able to deliver antibacterial compounds in vitro? (2) Can a hydrogel (alone or 
      antibacterial-loaded) coating on implants reduce bacterial colonization? And (3) 
      is intraoperative coating feasible and resistant to press-fit implant insertion? 
      METHODS: We tested the ability of Disposable Antibacterial Coating (DAC) hydrogel 
      (Novagenit Srl, Mezzolombardo, Italy) to deliver antibacterial agents using 
      spectrophotometry and a microbiologic assay. Antibacterial and antibiofilm 
      activity were determined by broth microdilution and a crystal violet assay, 
      respectively. Coating resistance to press-fit insertion was tested in rabbit 
      tibias and human femurs. RESULTS: Complete release of all tested antibacterial 
      compounds was observed in less than 96 hours. Bactericidal and antibiofilm effect 
      of DAC hydrogel in combination with various antibacterials was shown in vitro. 
      Approximately 80% of the hydrogel coating was retrieved on the implant after 
      press-fit insertion. CONCLUSIONS: Implant coating with an antibacterial-loaded 
      hydrogel reduces bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro. CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: A fast-resorbable, antibacterial-loaded hydrogel coating may help 
      prevent implant-related infections in orthopaedics. However, further validation 
      in animal models and properly controlled human studies is required.
