TI  - Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the "Treatment of 
      Early Age Mania (team)" sample generalize?
PG  - 307-14
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the representativeness of a randomized controlled trial 
      (RCT) sample versus one obtained by consecutive new case ascertainment, for 
      subjects with child bipolar I disorder. METHOD: Subjects (N = 247) were 
      outpatients who participated in either the National Institute of Mental 
      Health-funded Phenomenology and Course of Pediatric Bipolar Disorders study or 
      the Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM) study. Both studies required that 
      subjects have current DSM-IV bipolar I disorder (manic or mixed phase) and a 
      Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) score <or=60. All subjects had elation 
      and/or grandiosity. Subjects in the Phenomenology study were obtained from 1995 
      to 1998 by consecutive new case ascertainment from designated pediatric and 
      psychiatric facilities. Subjects in the TEAM RCT were recruited from media and 
      community sources between March 2003 and March 2005. Assessment instruments 
      included the Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective 
      Disorders and Schizophrenia, given separately to parents about their children and 
      to children about themselves, and the CGAS. Logistic regression was used for 
      comparisons. RESULTS: The TEAM and Phenomenology groups were similar in age (10.4 
      [SD = 2.3], 10.9 [SD = 2.3] years, respectively) and other demography. Both had 
      long current episode duration (4.8 [SD = 2.4], 3.2 [SD = 2.3] years) and low 
      lifetime use of any mood stabilizer (23.6%, 35.0%). Many mania symptoms and 
      ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality were significantly more 
      prevalent in the RCT sample. CONCLUSIONS: Generalization of the RCT sample was 
      supported, because only 7.8% of Phenomenology subjects did not fit the RCT 
      criteria. Nevertheless, because the RCT subjects were more severely ill, it is 
      unclear if treatment findings from the RCT will be applicable to children with 
      less severe mania. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier 
      NCT00057681 (TEAM study).
