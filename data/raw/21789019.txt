TI  - Do elderly cancer patients have different care needs compared with younger ones?
PG  - 374-9
AB  - AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The increasingly older population confronts oncologists with 
      an imposing challenge: older cancer patients have specific healthcare needs both 
      independent of and associated with the diagnosis of cancer. The aim of the 
      present study is to examine whether elderly versus younger cancer patients have 
      different needs with respect to attendance, treatment and information. METHODS 
      AND STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational and cross-sectional study. Cancer 
      patients aged 35 to 82 years were consecutively interviewed. The group was 
      divided into two subgroups aged </=65 and >/=66 years old. The Needs Evaluation 
      Questionnaire (NEQ) was used to assess patients' needs and demographic variables 
      were collected. Data analysis was carried out by means of cross-tabulation 
      analyses and the chi-square test. RESULTS: The requests most frequently expressed 
      by the older group concerned financial-insurance information (73.9%), the need to 
      talk to people with the same illness (71.7%), the need to receive more 
      comprehensible information from doctors and nurses (71.7%), and the need for a 
      better dialogue with clinicians (69.6%). Few significant differences between the 
      two age subgroups were found, with the exception of issues such as the need for 
      intimacy and support. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients have informational and 
      relational needs similar to those of younger patients. In fact, most of the whole 
      sample flagged up the need for higher levels of satisfaction especially 
      concerning a better dialogue with health staff, along with a new factor: the need 
      to talk to people with the same illness.
