TI  - Are physicians meeting the needs of family caregivers of the frail elderly?
PG  - 679-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore expressed needs, both formal and informal, of family 
      caregivers of frail elderly. To evaluate roles of physicians. DESIGN: 
      Questionnaire survey of members of the Montreal Jewish community providing care 
      for frail elderly family members. SETTING: Jewish community of Montreal. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Volunteer caregivers who were caring for a family member or friend 
      60 years or older, who had greatest responsibility for providing physical or 
      emotional support to an elderly person, who saw themselves as caregivers, and who 
      could speak English or French were studied. Of 118 volunteers, 32 were excluded 
      because they withdrew for personal reasons or because they did not meet study 
      criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic variables, functional status of the 
      care receiver, use of home care services, and needs assessment to identify 
      additional services. RESULTS: An average of 75.4% respondents did not use formal 
      support services. Just under half of caregivers were dissatisfied with the 
      attention they received from the health care system, and more than one third 
      expressed feelings of stress, depression, guilt, and isolation. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Hypotheses for this discontent are presented. Physicians may be uninterested in 
      helping caregivers; even if they were receptive to counseling caregivers, they 
      could be poorly remunerated for the types of counseling sessions that are usual 
      for caregivers; and being a professional caregiver to family caregivers is 
      demanding in itself.
