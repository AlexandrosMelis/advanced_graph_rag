      myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention?

AB  - BACKGROUND: SYNTAX score (SxS) has been demonstrated to predict long-term 
      outcomes in stable patients with coronary artery disease. But its prognostic 
      value for patients with acute coronary syndrome remains unknown. AIM: To evaluate 
      whether SxS could predict in-hospital outcomes for patients admitted with ST 
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary 
      intervention (pPCI). METHODS: The study included 538 patients with STEMI who 
      underwent pPCI between January 2010 and December 2012. The patients were divided 
      into two groups: low SxS (< 22) and high SxS (> 22). The SxS of all patients was 
      calculated from aninitial angiogram and TIMI flow grade of infarct related artery 
      was calculated after pPCI. Left ventricular systolic functions of the patients 
      were evaluated with an echocardiogram in the following week. The rates of 
      reinfarction and mortality during hospitalisation were obtained from the medical 
      records of our hospital. RESULTS: The high SxS group had more no-reflow (41% and 
      25.1%, p < 0.001, respectively), lower ejection fraction (38.2 +/- 7.5% and 44.6 +/- 
      8.8%, p < 0.001, respectively), and greater rates of re-infarction (9.5% and 
      7.3%, p = 0.037, respectively) and mortality (0.9% and 0.2%, p = 0.021, 
      respectively) during hospitalisation compared to the low SxS group. On 
      multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables, SxS was 
      an independent predictor of no-reflow (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.032-1.133, p = 0.001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: SxS is a useful tool that can predict in-hospital outcomes of 
      patients with STEMI undergoing pPCI.
