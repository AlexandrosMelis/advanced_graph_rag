AB  - AIM: To determine current practice and perceptions of the adequacy of training 
      and support received for the reporting of skeletal surveys in suspected physical 
      child abuse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A list of telephone numbers of UK hospitals 
      with a radiology department was obtained from the Royal College of Radiologists. 
      One hundred hospitals were then randomly selected for inclusion in the survey. An 
      18-item questionnaire was successfully administered to consultant radiologists 
      from 84 departments. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of departments had a named 
      radiologist to report their skeletal surveys, 16% assigned surveys to a random 
      radiologist, and 23% referred them elsewhere. Only 52% of departments had a 
      dedicated paediatric radiologist, thus in a significant proportion of departments 
      (25%) initial reports on skeletal surveys for physical abuse were provided by 
      non-paediatric radiologists. Fifteen percent did not have ready access to a 
      paediatric radiology opinion. Sixty-one percent thought that the service could be 
      improved. Expert evidence was provided by 5% of respondents. Seventy-three 
      percent would never consider providing expert evidence, even if given adequate 
      radiology and/or legal training. CONCLUSION: The survey shows significant 
      dissatisfaction amongst consultant radiologists with the current service, 
      confirms a low number of paediatric radiologists taking on this work, and 
      suggests the potential to increase numbers of radiology child abuse experts by 
      27% if given improved training and support. Appropriate service and education 
      strategies should be implemented.
