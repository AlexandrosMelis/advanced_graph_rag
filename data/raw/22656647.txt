AB  - BACKGROUND: Preventive home visits are offered to community dwelling older people 
      in Denmark aimed at maintaining their functional ability for as long as possible, 
      but only two thirds of older people accept the offer from the municipalities. The 
      purpose of this study is to investigate 1) whether socioeconomic status was 
      associated with acceptance of preventive home visits among older people and 2) 
      whether municipality invitational procedures for the preventive home visits 
      modified the association. METHODS: The study population included 1,023 community 
      dwelling 80-year-old individuals from the Danish intervention study on preventive 
      home visits. Information on preventive home visit acceptance rates was obtained 
      from questionnaires. Socioeconomic status was measured by financial assets 
      obtained from national registry data, and invitational procedures were identified 
      through the municipalities. Logistic regression analyses were used, adjusted by 
      gender. RESULTS: Older persons with high financial assets accepted preventive 
      home visits more frequently than persons with low assets (adjusted OR = 1.5 
      (CI95%: 1.1-2.0)). However, the association was attenuated when adjusted by the 
      invitational procedures. The odds ratio for accepting preventive home visits was 
      larger among persons with low financial assets invited by a letter with a 
      proposed date than among persons with high financial assets invited by other 
      procedures, though these estimates had wide confidence intervals. CONCLUSION: 
      High socioeconomic status was associated with a higher acceptance rate of 
      preventive home visits, but the association was attenuated by invitational 
      procedures. The results indicate that the social inequality in acceptance of 
      publicly offered preventive services might decrease if municipalities adopt more 
      proactive invitational procedures.
