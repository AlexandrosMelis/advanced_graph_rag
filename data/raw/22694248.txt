AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although the retroperitoneal approach has been the preferred choice 
      for open urological procedures, retroperitoneoscopy is not the preferred approach 
      for laparoscopy. This study aims to develop a training model for 
      retroperitoneoscopy and to establish an experimental learning curve. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Fifteen piglets were operated on to develop a standard 
      retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy (RPN) training model. All procedures were 
      performed with three ports. Intraoperative data (side, operative time, blood 
      loss, peritoneal opening) were recorded. Animals were divided into groups A, the 
      first eight, and B, the last seven cases. Data were statistically analyzed. 
      RESULTS: We performed fifteen RPNs. The operative time varied from 15 to 50 
      minutes (median 30 minutes). Blood loss varied from 5 to 100 mL (median 20 mL). 
      We experienced five peritoneal openings; we had two surgical vascular 
      complications managed laparoscopically. There was statistical difference between 
      groups A and B for peritoneal opening (p = 0.025), operative time (p = 0.0037), 
      and blood loss (p = 0.026). DISCUSSION: RPN in a porcine model could simulate the 
      whole procedure, from creating the space to nephrectomy completion. Experimental 
      learning curve was eight cases, after statistical data analysis. CONCLUSION: RPN 
      in a porcine model is feasible and could be very useful for teaching and 
      practicing retroperitoneoscopy.
