AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether government-funded, low-income vision care programs 
      improve use of eye care services by low-income individuals in Canada. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: 27,375 white respondents to the Canadian 
      Community Health Survey (CCHS) Healthy Aging 2008/2009. METHODS: 
      Government-funded, low-income vision care programs were reviewed. The amount of 
      assistance provided was compared with professional fee schedules for 
      general/routine eye examinations and market prices for eyeglasses. The 
      utilization of eye care providers was derived from the CCHS. RESULTS: To receive 
      low-income vision care assistance, individuals must be in receipt of social 
      assistance. Criteria for receiving social assistance are stringent. The Canadian 
      Financial Capability Survey revealed that 7.9% of Canadians aged 45 to 64 years 
      and 5.5% aged >/=65 years received social assistance in 2009. The CCHS found in 
      2008/2009 that 12.5% of citizens aged 45 to 64 years and 13.2% of those aged >/=65 
      years had difficulty paying for basic expenses such as food. In 5 provinces, 
      low-income vision care assistance fully covers a general/routine eye examination. 
      In the remainder, the assistance provided is insufficient for a general/routine 
      eye examination. The assistance for eyeglasses is inadequate in 5 provinces, 
      requiring out-of-pocket copayments. Among middle-aged whites who self-reported 
      not having glaucoma, cataracts, diabetes, or vision problems not corrected by 
      lenses, utilization of eye care providers was 28.1% among those with financial 
      difficulty versus 41.9% among those without (p < 0.05), giving a prevalence ratio 
      0.68 (95% CI 0.57-0.80) adjusted for age, sex and education. CONCLUSIONS: Despite 
      government assistance, low-income individuals use vision care services less often 
      than wealthy individuals.
