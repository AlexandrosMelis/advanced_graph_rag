AB  - AIM: To investigate the effectiveness of IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (IgM-eIVIG) 
      in reducing short-term mortality of neonates with proven late-onset sepsis. 
      METHODS: All VLBW infants from January 2008 to December 2012 with positive blood 
      culture beyond 72 hours of life were enrolled in a retrospective cohort study. 
      Newborns born after June 2010 were treated with IgM-eIVIG, 250 mg/kg/day iv for 
      three days in addition to standard antibiotic regimen and compared to an 
      historical cohort born before June 2010, receiving antimicrobial regimen alone. 
      Short-term mortality (i.e. death within 7 and 21 days from treatment) was the 
      primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were: total mortality, intraventricular 
      hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, 
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia at discharge. RESULTS: 79 neonates (40 cases) were 
      enrolled. No difference in birth weight, gestational age or SNAP II score 
      (disease severity score) were found. Significantly reduced short-term mortality 
      was found in treated infants (22% vs 46%; p = 0.005) considering all microbial 
      aetiologies and the subgroup affected by Candida spp. Secondary outcomes were not 
      different between groups. CONCLUSION: This hypothesis-generator study shows that 
      IgM-eIVIG is an effective adjuvant therapy in VLBW infants with proven sepsis. 
      Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm this pilot observation.
