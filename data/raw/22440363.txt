TI  - Mitral replacement or repair for functional mitral regurgitation in dilated and 
      ischemic cardiomyopathy: is it really the same?

AB  - BACKGROUND: This was a study to compare the results of mitral valve (MV) repair 
      and MV replacement for the treatment of functional mitral regurgitation (MR) in 
      advanced dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy (DCM). METHODS: One-hundred and 
      thirty-two patients with severe functional MR and systolic dysfunction (mean 
      ejection fraction 0.32 +/- 0.078) underwent mitral surgery in the same time frame. 
      The decision to replace rather than repair the MV was taken when 1 or more 
      echocardiographic predictors of repair failure were identified at the 
      preoperative echocardiogram. Eighty-five patients (64.4%) received MV repair and 
      47 patients (35.6%) received MV replacement. Preoperative characteristics were 
      comparable between the 2 groups. Only ejection fraction was significantly lower 
      in the MV repair group (0.308 +/- 0.077 vs 0.336 +/- 0.076, p = 0.04). RESULTS: 
      Hospital mortality was 2.3% for MV repair and 12.5% for MV replacement (p = 
      0.03). Actuarial survival at 2.5 years was 92 +/- 3.2% for MV repair and 73 +/- 7.9% 
      for MV replacement (p = 0.02). At a mean follow-up of 2.3 years (median, 1.6 
      years), in the MV repair group LVEF significantly increased (from 0.308 +/- 0.077 
      to 0.382 +/- 0.095, p < 0.0001) and LV dimensions significantly decreased (p = 
      0.0001). On the other hand, in the MV replacement group LVEF did not 
      significantly change (from 0.336 +/- 0.076 to 0.31 +/- 0.11, p = 0.56) and the 
      reduction of LV dimensions was not significant. Mitral valve replacement was 
      identified as the only predictor of hospital (odds ratio, 6; 95% confidence 
      interval, 1.1 to 31; p = 0.03) and overall mortality (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% 
      confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.9; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      advanced dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe functional MR, MV 
      replacement is associated with higher in-hospital and late mortality compared 
      with MV repair. Therefore, mitral repair should be preferred whenever possible in 
      this clinical setting.
