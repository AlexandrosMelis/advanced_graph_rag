TI  - Parasacral sciatic nerve block: does the elicited motor response predict the 
      success rate?
PG  - 263-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, we compared the 
      tibial and the peroneal evoked motor response with regard to efficacy of sciatic 
      nerve block using the parasacral approach. METHODS: Twenty-six ASA I-III patients 
      scheduled for elective lower limb surgery were randomized to receive a parasacral 
      sciatic block, using a nerve stimulator technique seeking either a tibial (n = 
      14) or peroneal (n = 12) motor response. After the evoked motor response was 
      obtained, a solution of 10 mL 2% lidocaine with epinephrine and 10 mL 0.75% 
      ropivacaine (actual final concentration of epinephrine, 1/160,000) was slowly 
      injected through the needle. Sensory and motor blocks were assessed every 5 min 
      for 30 min by an anesthesiologist blinded to the elicited motor response. If the 
      block was not complete 30 min after injection of the local anesthetics, it was 
      considered as failed, and general anesthesia was supplemented. RESULTS: Time to 
      perform the block and level of minimal and maximal stimulation were not different 
      between groups. The success rate of complete block was significantly higher in 
      the tibial compared to the peroneal group (11 of 14 vs 2 of 12; P = 0.002). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Eliciting a tibial motor response predicts a higher success rate 
      than eliciting a peroneal motor response with parasacral sciatic nerve block.
