TI  - Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?
PG  - 713-21; discussion 721-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the value of split-liver transplantation (SLT) 
      and living-related liver transplantation (LRT). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The 
      concept of SLT results from the development of reduced-size transplantation. A 
      further development of SLT, the in situ split technique, is derived from LRT, 
      which itself marks the optimized outcome in terms of postoperative graft function 
      and survival. The combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting 
      list, thus raising the question whether living donor liver transplantation is 
      still necessary. METHODS: Outcomes and postoperative liver function of 43 primary 
      LRT patients were compared with those of 49 primary SLT patients (14 ex situ, 35 
      in situ) with known graft weight performed between April 1996 and December 2000. 
      Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: After a 
      median follow-up of 35 months, actual patient survival rates were 82% in the SLT 
      group and 88% in the LRT group. Actual graft survival rates were 76% and 81%, 
      respectively. The incidence of primary nonfunction was 12% in the SLT group and 
      2.3% in the LRT group. Liver function parameters (prothrombin time, factor V, 
      bilirubin clearance) and surgical complication rates did not differ 
      significantly. In the SLT group, mean cold ischemic time was longer than in the 
      LRT group. Serum values of alanine aminotransferase during the first 
      postoperative week were significantly higher in the SLT group. In the LRT group, 
      there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration than in the SLT group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The short- and long-term outcomes after LRT and SLT did not differ 
      significantly. To avoid the risk for the donor in LRT, SLT represents the 
      first-line therapy in pediatric liver transplantation in countries where 
      cadaveric organs are available. LRT provides a solution for urgent cases in which 
      a cadaveric graft cannot be found in time or if the choice of the optimal time 
      point for transplantation is vital.
