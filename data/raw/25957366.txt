TI  - Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk As a Result of 
      Family History: Does It Work?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronic health records have the potential to facilitate family 
      history use by primary care physicians (PCPs) to provide personalized care. The 
      objective of this study was to determine whether automated, at-the-visit tailored 
      prompts about family history risk change PCP behavior. METHODS: Automated, 
      tailored prompts highlighting familial risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, 
      and breast, colorectal, or ovarian cancer were implemented during 2011 to 2012. 
      Medical records of a cohort of community-based primary care patients, aged 35 to 
      65 years, who previously participated in our Family Healthware study and had a 
      moderate or strong familial risk for any of the 6 diseases were subsequently 
      reviewed. The main outcome measures were PCP response to the prompts, adding 
      family history risk to problem summary lists, and patient screening status for 
      each disease. RESULTS: The 492 eligible patients had 847 visits during the study 
      period; 152 visits had no documentation of response to a family history prompt. 
      Of the remaining 695 visits, physician responses were reviewed family history (n 
      = 372, 53.5%), discussed family history (n = 159, 22.9%), not addressed (n = 155, 
      22.3%), and reviewed family history and ordered tests/referrals (n = 5, 0.7%). 
      There was no significant change in problem summary list documentation of risk 
      status or screening interventions for any of the 6 diseases. CONCLUSIONS: No 
      change occurred upon instituting simple, at-the-visit family history prompts 
      geared to improve PCPs' ability to identify patients at high risk for 6 common 
      conditions. The results are both surprising and disappointing. Further studies 
      should examine physicians' perception of the utility of prompts for family 
      history risk.
