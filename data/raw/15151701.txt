TI  - Profiling quality of care: Is there a role for peer review?
PG  - 9
AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to develop a more reliable structured implicit chart review 
      instrument for use in assessing the quality of care for chronic disease and to 
      examine if ratings are more reliable for conditions in which the evidence base 
      for practice is more developed. METHODS: We conducted a reliability study in a 
      cohort with patient records including both outpatient and inpatient care as the 
      objects of measurement. We developed a structured implicit review instrument to 
      assess the quality of care over one year of treatment. 12 reviewers conducted a 
      total of 496 reviews of 70 patient records selected from 26 VA clinical sites in 
      two regions of the country. Each patient had between one and four conditions 
      specified as having a highly developed evidence base (diabetes and hypertension) 
      or a less developed evidence base (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a 
      collection of acute conditions). Multilevel analysis that accounts for the nested 
      and cross-classified structure of the data was used to estimate the signal and 
      noise components of the measurement of quality and the reliability of implicit 
      review. RESULTS: For COPD and a collection of acute conditions the reliability of 
      a single physician review was quite low (intra-class correlation = 0.16-0.26) but 
      comparable to most previously published estimates for the use of this method in 
      inpatient settings. However, for diabetes and hypertension the reliability is 
      significantly higher at 0.46. The higher reliability is a result of the reviewers 
      collectively being able to distinguish more differences in the quality of care 
      between patients (p < 0.007) and not due to less random noise or individual 
      reviewer bias in the measurement. For these conditions the level of true quality 
      (i.e. the rating of quality of care that would result from the full population of 
      physician reviewers reviewing a record) varied from poor to good across patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: For conditions with a well-developed quality of care evidence base, 
      such as hypertension and diabetes, a single structured implicit review to assess 
      the quality of care over a period of time is moderately reliable. This method 
      could be a reasonable complement or alternative to explicit indicator approaches 
      for assessing and comparing quality of care. Structured implicit review, like 
      explicit quality measures, must be used more cautiously for illnesses for which 
      the evidence base is less well developed, such as COPD and acute, short-course 
      illnesses.
