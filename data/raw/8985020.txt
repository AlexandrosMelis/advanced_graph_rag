TI  - Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal 
      carcinoma? Results of treatment in the era of computerized tomography.
PG  - 1005-12
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the outcomes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 
      whose treatment was determined by computerized tomography (CT) and/or magnetic 
      resonance imaging staging and to analyze the impact of induction chemotherapy and 
      accelerated fractionated radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The analysis is 
      based on 122 of 143 previously untreated patients with NPC treated with radiation 
      therapy at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1983 and 
      1992. Excluded were 4 patients treated with palliative intent, 4 children, 12 
      patients not staged with CT, and 1 patient who died of a cerebrovascular accident 
      prior to completion of treatment. The stage distribution was as follows: AJCC 
      Stage I-2, Stage II-7, Stage III-12, Stage IV-101; Tl-15, T2-33, T3-22, T4-52; 
      N0-32, N1-10, N2-47, N3-32, Nx-1. Fifty-nine (48%) patients had squamous cell 
      carcinoma; 63 (52%) had lymphoepitheliomas, undifferentiated NPC or poorly 
      differentiated carcinoma, NOS (UNPC). Sixty-seven patients (65 with Stage IV 
      disease) received induction chemotherapy. Fifty-eight patients (24 of whom had 
      induction chemotherapy) were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation 
      schedule. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 57 months. RESULTS: The 
      overall actuarial 2- and 5-year survival rates were 78 and 68%, respectively. 
      Forty-nine patients (40%) had disease recurrence. Thirty-three (27%) had local 
      regional failures; 19 at the primary site only, 8 in the neck and 6 in both. 
      Local failure occurred in 31% of patients staged T4 compared to 13% of T1-T3 (p = 
      0.007). Sixteen patients failed at distant sites alone. Among Stage IV patients 
      the 5-year actuarial rates for patients who did and did not receive induction 
      chemotherapy were as follows: overall survival: 68 vs. 56% (p = 0.02), freedom 
      from relapse: 64 vs. 37% (p = 0.01), and local control: 86 vs. 56% (p = 0.009). 
      The actuarial 5-year distant failure rate in patients with UNPC who were treated 
      with induction chemotherapy and controlled in the primary and neck was 13%. In 
      patients who did not receive chemotherapy, the actuarial 5-year local control 
      rates for patients treated with concomitant boost or conventional fractionation 
      were 66 and 67%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While not providing conclusive 
      evidence, this single institution experience suggests that neoadjuvant 
      chemotherapy for Stage IV NPC patients improves both survival and disease 
      control. Recurrence within the irradiated volume was the most prevalent mode of 
      failure and future studies will evaluate regimens to enhance local regional 
      control.
