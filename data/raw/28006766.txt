TI  - Is Overexpression of Ki-67 a Prognostic Biomarker of Upper Tract Urinary 
      Carcinoma? A Retrospective Cohort Study and Meta-Analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC) is a relatively uncommon but 
      aggressive disease. The Ki-67 antigen is a classic marker of cellular 
      proliferation, but there is still controversy regarding the significance and 
      importance of Ki-67 in tumor progression. METHODS: In this study, we first 
      detected Ki-67 expression in UTUC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). 
      Subsequently, we quantitatively combined the results with those from the 
      published literature in a meta-analysis after searching several databases. 
      RESULTS: IHC results demonstrated that patients with muscle-invasive tumors 
      (T2-T4) had higher Ki-67 expression than those with non-muscle-invasive tumors 
      (Tis-T1), suggesting that high Ki-67 expression may be associated with the 
      aggressive form of UTUC. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with high Ki-67 
      expression had significantly poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) and 
      disease-free survival (DFS). Furthermore, multivariate analysis suggested that 
      Ki-67 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CSS (hazard ratio, 
      HR=3.196) and DFS (HR=3.517) in UTUC patients. Then, a meta-analysis of the 
      published literature investigating Ki-67 expression and its effects on UTUC 
      prognosis was conducted. After searching the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane 
      Library and Scopus databases, 12 articles met the eligibility criteria for this 
      analysis. The eligible studies included a total of 1740 patients with a mean 
      number of 82 patients per study (range, 38-475). The combined results showed that 
      increased Ki-67 levels were associated with poor survival and disease 
      progression, with a pooled HR estimate of 2.081 and 2.791, respectively. In 
      subgroup analysis, the pooled HR was statistically significant for 
      cancer-specific survival (HR=2.276), metastasis-free survival (HR=3.008) and 
      disease-free survival (HR=6.336). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, high Ki-67 
      expression was associated with poor survival in patients with UTUC, as well as a 
      high risk of disease progression, although these findings need to be interpreted 
      with caution. Large-scale, adequately designed, prospective trials are needed to 
      further confirm the value of Ki-67 in prognosis of UTUC patients.
