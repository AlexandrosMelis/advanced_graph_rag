TI  - Sternal skin conductance: a reasonable surrogate for hot flash measurement?
PG  - 1164-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the accuracy of a new sternal skin 
      conductance (SSC) device in measuring hot flashes and to assess the acceptability 
      of the device by women. METHODS: Three small descriptive pilot studies were 
      performed using two sequential prototypes of the SSC device developed by an 
      engineering device company in the Midwest. The devices were worn either in a 
      monitored setting for 24 hours or in an ambulatory setting for 5 weeks. During 
      the study period, women recorded hot flashes in a prospective hot flash diary and 
      answered questions about the acceptability of wearing the SSC device. RESULTS: 
      The first prototype was not able to collect any analyzable skin conductance data 
      owing to various malfunction issues, including poor conductance and battery 
      failure. However, 16 women wore the device for 5 weeks and reported that wearing 
      the device was acceptable, although 31% stated that it interfered with daily 
      activities. Hot flash data from the second prototype revealed a 24% concordance 
      rate between self-reported and device-recorded hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Findings 
      from these studies support discordance between device-recorded and self-reported 
      hot flashes. In addition, the studies reveal further limitations of SSC 
      monitoring, including difficulties with data collection and lack of consistency 
      in interpretation. Based on these results and other recent trials identifying 
      issues with SSC methodology, it is time to find a better physiologic surrogate 
      measure for hot flashes.
