TI  - Pulmonary valve replacement in adults late after repair of tetralogy of fallot: 
      are we operating too late?
PG  - 1670-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to evaluate right ventricular (RV) 
      volume and function after pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) and to address the 
      issue of optimal surgical timing in these patients. BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary 
      regurgitation (PR) following repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) leads to RV 
      dilation and an increased incidence of sudden cardiac death in adult patients. 
      METHODS: We studied 25 consecutive adult patients who underwent PVR for 
      significant PR late after repair of TOF. Radionuclide angiography was performed 
      in all at a mean of 8.2 months (+/- 8 months) before PVR and repeated at a mean 
      of 28.0 months (+/- 22.8 months) after the operation. Right ventricular (RV) 
      end-systolic volume (RVESV), RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) and RV ejection 
      fraction (RVEF) were measured. RESULTS: Mean RVEDV, RVESV and RVEF remained 
      unchanged after PVR (227.1 ml versus 214.9 ml, p = 0.74; 157.4 ml versus 155.4 
      ml, p = 0.94; 35.6% versus 34.7%, p = 0.78, respectively). Of the 10 patients 
      with RVEF > or = 0.40 before PVR, 5 patients (50%) maintained a RVEF > or = 0.40 
      following PVR, whereas only 2 out of 15 patients (13%) with pre-operative values 
      <0.40 reached an RVEF > or = 0.40 postoperatively (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Right 
      ventricular recovery following PVR for chronic significant pulmonary 
      regurgitation after repair of TOF may be compromised in the adult population. In 
      order to maintain adequate RV contractility, pulmonary valve implant in these 
      patients should be considered before RV function deteriorates.
