TI  - Can continuous physical training counteract aging effect on myoelectric fatigue? 
      A surface electromyography study application.
PG  - 513-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the myoelectric onset of muscle fatigue in physically 
      active trained young skiers with respect to elderly skiers and to test whether 
      continuous training can counteract the selective loss of type II muscle fibers 
      usually observed with aging. DESIGN: An observational, cross-sectional study of 
      the myoelectric onset of muscle fatigue in the left tibialis anterior muscles. 
      SETTING: Surface electromyography recorded with portable devices at a downhill 
      ski rescue lodge in the Italian Alps. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-four physically 
      trained, active skiers (43 men, 11 women; age range, 24-85y). INTERVENTIONS: 
      Questionnaire on physical activity and 2 sustained isometric voluntary 
      contractions at 20% and 2 at 80% of the maximal voluntary contraction level. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Isometric contractions and mean and median spectral frequencies 
      calculated to monitor the myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue. RESULTS: 
      Fatigue indices did not differ significantly between younger and older subjects 
      and, thus, did not show a correlation between myoelectric manifestations of 
      muscle fatigue and age in physically active subjects. CONCLUSION: It appears 
      possible that aging skeletal muscles subjected to continuous exercise develop an 
      adaptive response that counteracts the selective loss of type II muscle fibers 
      usually observed in the muscles of elderly sedentary subjects. Our results 
      suggest that physical activity could be considered in the elderly within a broad 
      rehabilitative framework in which appropriate and even tailored physical training 
      could be planned to counteract the physiologic effects of aging on muscle fiber 
      distribution.
