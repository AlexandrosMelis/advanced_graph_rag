AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated associations between the performance of dental 
      students in each of the three components of the selection procedure [academic 
      average, Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test (UMAT) and 
      structured interview], socio-demographic characteristics and their academic 
      success in an undergraduate dental surgery programme. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Longitudinal review of admissions data relating to students entering dental 
      education at the University of Otago, New Zealand, between 2004 and 2009 was 
      compared with academic performance throughout the dental programme. RESULTS AND 
      DISCUSSION: After controlling for variables, pre-admission academic average, UMAT 
      scores and interview performance did not predict performance as a dental student. 
      Class place in second year, however, was a strong predictor of class place in 
      final year. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the best predictors of higher 
      class placement in the final year were New Zealand European ethnicity and 
      domestic (rather than international) student status. Other socio-demographic 
      characteristics were not associated with performance. These interim findings 
      provide a sound base for the ongoing study. CONCLUSION: The study found important 
      socio-demographic differences in pre-admission test scores, but those scores did 
      not predict performance in the dental programme, whether measured in second year 
      or in final year.
