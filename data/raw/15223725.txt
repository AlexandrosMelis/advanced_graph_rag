TI  - Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether 
      it is measured by a physician or a nurse?
PG  - 164-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether there are differences between blood pressure 
      (BP) measured by the nurse (NBP), BP measured by the physician (PBP) and 
      self-measured BP in treated hypertensive patients and, if found, to evaluate 
      their clinical importance. METHOD: An observational study is carried out with 
      hypertensive patients recruited from two village-based community health centres 
      in Catalonia (Spain) serving an area with a total population of 2800 inhabitants. 
      All patients treated for hypertension visiting the health centre on a specific 
      day of the week and during the same timetable between October 2000 and May 2001 
      were included. RESULTS: The difference between physician-systolic BP and 
      nurse-systolic BP was 5.16 mmHg (95% CI 2.62-7.7; p<0.001). The difference 
      between physician-systolic BP and self-measured systolic BP was 4.67 mmHg (95% CI 
      0.89-8.44; p=0.016). The differences between nurse-systolic BP and self-measured 
      systolic BP were not significant (0.49 mmHg; 95% CI 3.71-2.71; p=0.758). With 
      regards to diastolic BP, no significant differences were found between the 
      different ways of measurement. NBP gave the following values: sensitivity (Sn) of 
      92% and specificity (Sp) of 60%; positive predictive value (PPV) of 65.7% and 
      negative predictive value (NPV) of 90% with a positive coefficient of probability 
      (CP+) of 2.3 and a negative coefficient of probability (CP-) of 0.133. PBP gave 
      the following results: Sn=72%; Sp=66.7%; PPV=64.3%; NPV=74.1%; CP+=2.16 and CP- = 
      0.420. CONCLUSION: Systolic BP measured by the nurse in treated hypertensive 
      patients is significantly lower than the readings obtained by the physician, and 
      are almost identical to ambulatory BP monitoring. Blood pressure determination by 
      the nurse is desirable not only for diagnosis but also to evaluate the level of 
      control of blood pressure during the follow-up of treated hypertensive patients.
