      prognostic factor?

AB  - PURPOSE: Platelet count is inversely related to prognosis in many cancers; 
      however, its role in esophageal cancer is still controversial. The purpose of 
      this study was to determine the prognostic value of preoperative platelet count 
      in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: From January 2006 to 
      December 2008, a retrospective analysis of 425 consecutive patients with ESCC was 
      conducted. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for survival 
      prediction was plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for preoperative 
      platelet count. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate 
      the prognostic parameters. RESULTS: A ROC curve for survival prediction was 
      plotted to verify the optimum cutoff point for platelet count, which was 205 (x 
      10(9)/L). Patients with platelet count </= 205 had a significantly better 5-year 
      survival than patients with a platelet count >205 (60.7 vs. 31.6 %, P < 0.001). 
      The 5-year survival of patients either with platelet count </= 205 or >205 were 
      similar (68.6 vs. 58.8 %, P = 0.085) when the nodes were negative. However, the 
      5-year survival of patients with platelet count </= 205 was better than that of 
      patients with a platelet count >205 when the nodes were involved (32.0 vs. 12.7 
      %, P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis showed that platelet count (P = 0.013), T 
      grade (P = 0.017), and N staging (P < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative platelet count is a predictive factor for long-term 
      survival in ESCC, especially in nodal-positive patients. We conclude that 205 
      (x10(9)/L) may be the optimum cutoff point for platelet count in predicting 
      survival in ESCC patients.
