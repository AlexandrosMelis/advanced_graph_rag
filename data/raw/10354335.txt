TI  - Can medical students contribute to quality assurance programmes in day surgery?
PG  - 509-14
AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES: Health care delivery has undertaken a major shift from 
      inpatient management to ambulatory surgical care with increasing emphasis on 
      quality assurance (QA) processes. Educational opportunities for medical 
      undergraduate programmes are being sought in the day surgery environment. Our 
      study was undertaken to explore ways in which senior medical students can 
      actively contribute to QA processes as part of an undergraduate day surgery 
      educational programme. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Health care delivery has undertaken 
      a major shift from inpatient management to ambulatory surgical care with 
      increasing emphasis on quality assurance (QA) processes. Educational 
      opportunities for medical undergraduate programmes are being sought in the day 
      surgery environment. Our study was undertaken to explore ways in which senior 
      medical students can actively contribute to the QA processes as part of an 
      undergraduate day surgery educational programme. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-nine 
      final year medical students followed allocated patients with common surgical 
      conditions through all phases of the day surgery process. Students kept records 
      about each case in a log book and also presented their cases at weekly Problem 
      Based Learning tutorials. An audit of student log books and review of tutorial 
      records was conducted for the 1996 and 1997 academic years, in order to evaluate 
      student contribution to QA. RESULTS: Students followed 621 cases, representing a 
      sampling of 14. 1% day surgery cases. Categories of problems highlighted by 
      students included inappropriate patient and procedure selection, inadequate pain 
      management, discharge, communication and resource issues. Students made a number 
      of recommendations including the development of multilingual videotapes and 
      patient information sheets for non-English speaking patients, avoidance of 
      bilateral surgical procedures and improved links with local medical officers. 
      They also developed new guidelines and protocols. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms 
      that students are able to identify QA issues and propose solutions. We recommend 
      that students have a formally recognized place in day surgery QA programmes, to 
      close the QA loop and to adequately prepare them for medical practice in the 21st 
      century.
