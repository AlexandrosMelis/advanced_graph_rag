AB  - AIM: To evaluate the relationship between the incidence of late 
      post-tonsillectomy haemorrhage and its prevalence in a definite period of the 
      day. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This retrospective study was carried out in the 
      Ear Nose Throat (ENT) Unit of Giannina Gaslini Institute, Genoa, Italy on 
      children operated for adenotonsillectomy (AT) or tonsillectomy (T) between 
      January 2003 and February 2008. We considered in the study all the 
      post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages irrespective of their severity and for each 
      case we evaluated whether they recurred in the day-time (B) (between 9.00 a.m. 
      and 9.00 p.m.) or in the night-time (A) (between 9.00 p.m. and 9.00 a.m.). 
      Finally we considered the number of haemorrhages per hour in the whole day. 
      RESULTS: Out of 3306 patients undergoing elective adenotonsillectomy or 
      tonsillectomy, post-operative late haemorrhage occurred in 59 (1.78%). We noted 
      that 42 episodes (71.2%) occurred in the night-time and 17 (28.8%) in the 
      day-time. The average time from the operation was 8.4 days. A statistically 
      significant difference (p=0.002) was found when comparing the frequencies of 
      night-time and day-time haemorrhages. We did not observe any significant 
      difference in the distribution per hour of the haemorrhages. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      incidence of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage in our study population was 
      1.78%. A statistically significant difference was found between night-time and 
      day-time haemorrhages. Even though no significant distribution of haemorrhages 
      per hour was observed, we underline that we recorded 32 (54.2%) events in 2 
      periods of the day: from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and from 6 to 9 a.m.
