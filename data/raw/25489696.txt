      exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy reduces local recurrence rates but is also capable of 
      short- and long-term toxicity. It may also render treatment of local recurrence 
      more challenging if it develops despite previous radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study examined the impact of radiotherapy for the primary rectal cancer on 
      outcomes after pelvic exenteration for local recurrence. DESIGN: We conducted a 
      retrospective review of exenteration databases. SETTING: The study took place at 
      a quaternary referral center that specializes in pelvic exenteration. PATIENTS: 
      Patients referred for pelvic exenteration from October 1994 to November 2012 were 
      reviewed. Patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy as part of their 
      primary rectal cancer treatment were compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main 
      outcomes of interest were resection margins, overall survival, disease-free 
      survival, and surgical morbidities. RESULTS: There were 108 patients, of which 87 
      were eligible for analysis. Patients who received radiotherapy for their primary 
      rectal cancer (n = 41) required more radical exenterations (68% vs 44%; p = 
      0.020), had lower rates of clear resection margins (63% vs 87%; p = 0.010), had 
      increased rates of surgical complications per patient (p = 0.014), and had a 
      lower disease-free survival (p = 0.022). Overall survival and disease-free 
      survival in patients with clear margins were also lower in the primary irradiated 
      patients (p = 0.049 and p < 0.0001). This difference in survival persisted in 
      multivariate analysis that corrected for T and N stages of the primary tumor. 
      LIMITATIONS: This study is limited by its retrospective nature and heterogeneous 
      radiotherapy regimes among radiotherapy patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who 
      previously received radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer treatment have worse 
      oncologic outcomes than those who had not received radiotherapy after pelvic 
      exenteration for locally recurrent rectal cancer.
