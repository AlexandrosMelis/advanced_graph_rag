TI  - Can computerised tomography replace bone scintigraphy in detecting bone 
      metastases from breast cancer? A prospective study.
PG  - 98-103
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine whether bone scans (BS) can be 
      avoided if pelvis was included in CT thorax and abdomen to detect bony metastases 
      from breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Results of 77 pairs of CT (thorax, 
      abdomen, and pelvis) and BS in newly diagnosed patients with metastatic breast 
      cancer (MBC) were compared prospectively for 12 months. Both scans were blindly 
      assessed by experienced radiologists and discussed at multidisciplinary team 
      meetings regarding the diagnosis of bone metastases. RESULTS: CT detected 
      metastatic bone lesions in 43 (98%) of 44 patients with bone metastases. The 
      remaining patient had a solitary, asymptomatic bony metastasis in shaft of femur. 
      BS was positive in all patients with bone metastases. There were 11 cases of 
      false positive findings on BS. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest routine BS of 
      patients presenting with MBC is not required if CT (thorax, abdomen, and pelvis) 
      is performed.
