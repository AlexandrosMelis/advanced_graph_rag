TI  - Does rugby headgear prevent concussion? Attitudes of Canadian players and 
      coaches.
PG  - 19-22
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the attitudes of players and coaches to the use of 
      protective headgear, particularly with respect to the prevention of concussion. 
      METHODS: A questionnaire designed to assess attitudes to headgear was 
      administered to 63 players from four different Canadian teams, each representing 
      a different level of play (high school, university, community club, national). In 
      addition, coaches from all four levels were questioned about team policies and 
      their personal opinions about the use of headgear to prevent concussion. RESULTS: 
      Although the players tended to believe that the headgear could prevent concussion 
      (62%), the coaches were less convinced (33%). Despite the players' belief that 
      headgear offers protection against concussion, only a minority reported wearing 
      headgear (27%) and few (24%) felt that its use should be made mandatory. Common 
      reasons for not wearing headgear were "its use is not mandatory", "it is 
      uncomfortable", and "it costs too much". CONCLUSION: Although most players in the 
      study believe that rugby headgear may prevent concussion, only a minority 
      reported wearing it. Coaches tended to be less convinced than the players that 
      rugby headgear can prevent concussion.
