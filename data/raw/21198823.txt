AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevation of cardiac troponin (cTn) is considered specific for 
      myocardial damage. Elevated cTn and echocardiogrpahic documentation of wall 
      motion abnormalities (WMAs) that were recorded after extreme physical effort 
      raise the question whether dobutamine stress echo (DSE), can also induce 
      elevation of troponin. METHODS: we prospective enrolled stable patients (age >18 
      years) referred to DSE. The exam was performed under standardized conditions. 
      Blood samples for cTnI were obtained at baseline and 18-24 hours after the test. 
      We aimed to compare between the clinical and echocardiographic features of 
      patients with elevated cTnI and those without cTnI elevations. RESULTS: 
      Fifty-seven consecutive patients were included. The average age was 64.4 +/- 10.7, 
      73% of the patients were males, and nearly half of the patients were known to 
      have ischemic heart disease. Two of the patients were excluded due to technical 
      difficulty. No signs of ischemia were recorded in 25 (45.4%). Among the patients 
      with established ischemia on DSE, 12 (22%) had mild ischemia, 13 (23.6%) had 
      moderate and 5 (9%) had severe ischemia. Angiography was performed in 13 (26%) of 
      the patients, of which 7 had PCI and one was referred to bypass surgery. None of 
      the patients had elevated cTnI 18-24 hours after the DSE. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      results indicate that there is no elevation of cTn despite the occurrence of 
      significant WMAs on DSE. We conclude that cTnI cannot be used as an additional 
      diagnostic tool during pharmacological stress test performed to evaluate the 
      presence and severity of ischemia.
