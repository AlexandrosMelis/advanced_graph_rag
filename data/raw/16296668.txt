TI  - Can bedside assessment reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke?
PG  - 99-106
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ability of a bedside swallowing assessment to 
      reliably exclude aspiration following acute stroke. SUBJECTS: Consecutive 
      patients admitted within 24 h of stroke onset to two hospitals. METHODS: A 
      prospective study. Where possible, all patients had their ability to swallow 
      assessed on the day of admission by both a doctor and a speech and language 
      therapist using a standardized proforma. A videofluoroscopy examination was 
      conducted within 3 days of admission. RESULTS: 94 patients underwent 
      videofluoroscopy; 20 (21%) were seen to be aspirating, although this was not 
      detected at the bedside in 10. In 18 (22%) of the patients the speech and 
      language therapist considered the swallow to be unsafe. In the medical 
      assessment, 39 patients (41%) had an unsafe swallow. Bedside assessment by a 
      speech and language therapist gave a sensitivity of 47%, a specificity of 86%, 
      positive predictive value (PPV) of 50% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 
      85% for the presence of aspiration. Multiple logistic regression was used to 
      identify the optimum elements of the bedside assessments for predicting the 
      presence of aspiration. A weak voluntary cough and any alteration in conscious 
      level gave a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 72%, PPV of 41% and NPV of 91% 
      for aspiration. CONCLUSION: Bedside assessment of swallowing lacks the necessary 
      sensitivity to be used as a screening instrument in acute stroke, but there are 
      concerns about the use of videofluoroscopy as a gold standard. The relative 
      importance of aspiration and bedside assessment in predicting complications and 
      outcome needs to be studied.
