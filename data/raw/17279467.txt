TI  - Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal 
      fragility?
PG  - 1137-40
AB  - Cyclical pamidronate therapy in a 2-year-old child with skeletal fragility 
      resulted in remodelling of vertebral fractures and improvement in bone mineral 
      density (BMD) at distal radial and spinal sites. The BMD at both sites decreased 
      precipitously within 24 months of stopping treatment, raising the question as to 
      whether bisphosphonates can be stopped in a growing child with skeletal 
      fragility. INTRODUCTION: At age 23 months, a male toddler sustained a low trauma 
      fracture of his right femur. Skeletal radiographs revealed generalised osteopenia 
      with multiple vertebral body fractures. He was diagnosed with type IV 
      osteogenesis imperfecta; however, no mutations were found in COL1A1 or COL1A2 
      genes. METHODS: This case report presents bone densitometry data before, during 
      and after bisphosphonate treatment. Axial QCT was main outcome from 2 years of 
      age; DXA and pQCT were taken after age 5. RESULTS: QCT confirmed that he had low 
      spinal trabecular volumetric BMD (Z-score -2.4). After 4 years of treatment his 
      vertebral fractures had been remodelled and all bone densitometry values (QCT, 
      DXA and pQCT) were within normal range and therefore treatment was discontinued. 
      Shortly after this he suffered stress fractures of his left mid tibia and at the 
      sclerotic metaphyseal line corresponding to his first APD treatment. He had 
      marked reduction in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD; change in BMAD was 
      less marked. CONCLUSION: The patient has been restarted on IV APD therapy. This 
      case has led us to consider whether bisphosphonate therapy can be discontinued in 
      a child with fragility fractures before his/her linear growth has ceased?
