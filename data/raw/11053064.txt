TI  - Fatigue in primary Sjogren's syndrome: is there a link with the fibromyalgia 
      syndrome?
PG  - 875-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fibromyalgia (FM) is more common in patients with 
      primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) who complain of fatigue. The association and 
      prevalence of fatigue and FM was recorded in a group of patients with pSS and a 
      control group of lupus patients, a subset of whom had secondary Sjogren's 
      syndrome (sSS). METHODS: 74 patients with pSS and 216 patients with lupus were 
      assessed with a questionnaire to identify the presence of fatigue and generalised 
      pain. From the lupus group, in a subset of 117 lupus patients (from the 
      Bloomsbury unit) those with sSS were identified. All patients were studied for 
      the presence of FM. RESULTS: 50 of 74 patients with pSS (68%) reported fatigue-a 
      prevalence significantly higher than in the lupus group (108/216 (50%); 
      p<0.0087). Fatigue was present in 7/13 (54%) patients with SLE/sSS. FM was 
      present in 9/74 patients with pSS (12%), compared with 11/216 lupus patients 
      (5%), and in none of the patients with SLE/sSS. None of these values corresponds 
      with previously reported figures of the incidence of FM in pSS. CONCLUSION: The 
      results show that fatigue in patients with pSS and sSS is not due to the 
      coexistence of FM in most cases. A lower incidence in the United Kingdom of FM in 
      patients with pSS was found than has been previously reported.
