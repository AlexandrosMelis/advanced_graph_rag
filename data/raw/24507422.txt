      from atherosclerotic plaque in patients evaluated with CTA for stroke or 
      transient ischemic attack?

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting with transient ischemic attack or 
      stroke may have symptom-related lesions on acute computed tomography angiography 
      (CTA) such as free-floating intraluminal thrombus (FFT). It is difficult to 
      distinguish FFT from carotid plaque, but the distinction is critical as 
      management differs. By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions ("virtual 
      endarterectomy"), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective 
      of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately 
      differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We 
      collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 +/- 
      10 years; 10 women, 65.5 +/- 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were 
      defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus 
      false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted 
      from CTA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most 
      discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic 
      (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average 
      classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation. RESULTS: Follow-up 
      imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors 
      delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from 
      combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a 
      specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 +/- 0.09. Average 
      accuracy for each classifier ranged from 65.2%-76.4%. CONCLUSIONS: We identified 
      five quantitative shape descriptors of carotid FFT. This shape "signature" shows 
      potential for supplementing conventional lesion characterization in cases of 
      suspected FFT.
