TI  - Can progression of valvar aortic stenosis be predicted accurately?
PG  - 676-80; discussion 680
AB  - BACKGROUND: It was the aim of the present study to elaborate criteria for the 
      assessment of rapid hemodynamic progression of valvar aortic stenosis. These 
      criteria are of special importance when cardiac surgery is indicated for other 
      reasons but the established criteria for aortic valve replacement are not yet 
      fulfilled. Such aspects of therapeutic planing were mostly disregarded in the 
      past so that patients had to undergo cardiac reoperation within a few years. 
      METHODS: Hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and clinical data of 169 men and 88 
      women with aortic stenosis, aged 55.2 +/- 15.7 years at their first and 63.4 +/- 
      15.6 years at their second cardiac catheterization, were analyzed. RESULTS: The 
      progression rate of aortic valve obstruction was found to be dependent on the 
      degree of valvar calcification ([VC] scoring 0 to III) and to be exponentially 
      correlated with the aortic valve opening area (AVA) at initial catheterization. 
      Neither age nor sex of the patient nor etiology of the valvar obstruction 
      significantly influence the progression of aortic stenosis. If AVA decreases 
      below 0.75 cm(2) with a present degree of VC = 0, or AVA of 0.8 with VC of I, AVA 
      of 0.9 with VC of II, or AVA of 1.0 with VC of III, it is probable that aortic 
      stenosis will have to be operated upon in the following years. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      present data indicate that for clinical purposes and planning of valvar surgery 
      the progression of asymptomatic aortic stenosis can be sufficiently predicted by 
      the present aortic valve opening area and the degree of valvar calcification.
