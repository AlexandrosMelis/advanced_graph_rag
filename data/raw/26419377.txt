AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate safe depth for suture anchor 
      insertion during acetabular labral repair and to determine the neighbouring 
      structures at risk during drilling and anchor insertion. METHODS: Ten human 
      cadaveric hips (six males and four females) were obtained. Acetabular labral 
      surface was prepared and marked for right hips as 12, 1 and 3 o'clock positions, 
      for left hips 12, 11 and 9 o'clock positions. Those were defined as anterior, 
      anterior-superior and superior zones, respectively. These labral positions were 
      drilled at defined zones. After measurements, depth of the bone at 10 degrees  and 20 degrees  
      drill angles on zones was compared statistically. RESULTS: Acetabular bone widths 
      at investigated labral insertion points did not statistically differ. A total of 
      14 injuries in 60 penetrations occurred (23.3 %) with free drill penetrations, 
      and no injuries occurred with stopped drill penetrations. The bone depth was 
      gradually decreasing from 10 degrees  to 20 degrees  drill angles and from anterior to superior 
      inserting zones without significant importance. The risk of perforation to the 
      pelvic cavity started with 20 mm drill depth, and the mean depth for all 
      insertions was calculated as 31.7 mm (SD 2.6). CONCLUSIONS: It is anatomically 
      possible that some pelvic structures sustain iatrogenic injury during acetabular 
      drilling for anchor placement. Being aware of mean pelvic vault is important in 
      which drilling after excessive pincer rim trimming could easily decrease the 
      depth of acetabular bone without a standard. Careful drilling by using stopped 
      drill bit is crucial to prevent iatrogenic injury.
