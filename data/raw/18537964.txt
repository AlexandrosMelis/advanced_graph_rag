AB  - AIMS: To determine the impact of a physician's specialty on the frequency and 
      depth of medication history documented in patient medical records. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional assessment of the frequency and depth of medication history 
      information documented by 123 physicians for 900 randomly selected patients 
      stratified across Cardiology, Chest, Dermatology, Endocrine, Gastroenterology, 
      Haematology, Neurology, Psychiatry and Renal specialties was carried out at a 
      900-bed teaching hospital located in Ibadan, Nigeria. RESULTS: Four hundred and 
      forty-three (49.2%) of the cohort were males and 457 (50.8%) were females; with 
      mean ages 43.2 +/- 18.6 and 43.1 +/- 17.9 years respectively. Physicians' 
      specialties significantly influenced the depth of documentation of the medication 
      history information across the nine specialties (P < 0.0001). Post hoc pair-wise 
      comparisons with Tukey's HSD test showed that the mean scores for adverse drug 
      reactions and adherence to medicines was highest in the Cardiology specialty; 
      while the Chest specialty had the highest mean scores for allergy to drugs, food, 
      chemicals and cigarette smoking. Mean scores for the use of alcohol; illicit 
      drugs; dietary restrictions was highest for Gastroenterology, Psychiatry and 
      Endocrine specialties respectively. Physicians' specialties also significantly 
      influenced the frequency of documentation of the medication history across the 
      nine specialties (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians appear to document more 
      frequently and in greater depth medication history information that may aid the 
      diagnostic tasks in their specific specialty. Researchers and other users of 
      medication history data documented in patients' medical records by physicians may 
      want to take special cognizance of this phenomenon.
