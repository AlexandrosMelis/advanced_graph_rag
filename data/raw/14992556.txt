TI  - Artefacts in 24-h pharyngeal and oesophageal pH monitoring: is simplification of 
      pH data analysis feasible?
PG  - 14-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ambulatory 24-h dual-channel pharyngeal and oesophageal pH monitoring 
      is the standard test for measuring gastro-oesophageal and gastropharyngeal 
      reflux. Artefacts caused by the intake of food may result in falsely positive 
      gastropharyngeal reflux, which necessitates a manual review of 24-h pH data. The 
      purpose of the study was to investigate the influence of meals and whether 
      leaving out meals affected the reliability of the test. METHODS: Patients 
      referred for otolaryngological complaints, suspected to have been caused by 
      gastro-oesophageal reflux, underwent 24-h dual-channel pH monitoring. The raw 
      unprocessed pH data were corrected by visual inspection of the 24-h tracings 
      (corrected data), by leaving out meals or meals plus a 2-h postprandrial period. 
      RESULTS: The raw pH data were substantially influenced by artefacts of food 
      intake and pseudoreflux. Data obtained by leaving out meals agreed best with 
      manually corrected data. Many of the falsely positive reflux episodes could be 
      removed, thereby inducing a 9%-18% chance of undetected reflux. When examining 
      the fraction of time supine, manually corrected data and data leaving out meals 
      were fully concordant and detected 79% of patients with gastropharyngeal reflux. 
      However, leaving out meals plus a 2-h postprandrial period resulted in 21%-50% 
      falsely negative tests. CONCLUSION: Leaving out the period of intake of meals and 
      beverages from the raw pH data might be the second best test after the 
      time-consuming visual correction with a small chance of undetected 
      gastropharyngeal reflux. For scientific purposes and when in doubt, it remains 
      necessary to review the computer-generated data manually to discover every 
      gastropharyngeal reflux event.
