AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients 
      who were referred to specialist care after reporting gynecological cancer alarm 
      symptoms to their general practitioner. We sought to investigate whether contact 
      with specialist care was associated with lifestyle factors or socioeconomic 
      status. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nationwide population-based prospective cohort 
      study in Denmark, based on a random sample of 51 090 women aged 20 years or older 
      from the general population. A web-based questionnaire regarding gynecological 
      alarm symptoms and lifestyle was distributed to the invited individuals. Data 
      about contact with specialist care were obtained from the National Patient 
      Register and the National Health Insurance Service Registry, whereas information 
      about socioeconomic status was collected from Statistics Denmark. Main outcome 
      measures were percentages of patients having contact with specialist care and 
      odds ratios (ORs) for associations between specialist care contact, lifestyle 
      factors and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: The study included 25 866 nonpregnant 
      women; 2957 reported the onset of at least one gynecological cancer alarm 
      symptom, and 683 of these (23.1%) reported symptoms to their general 
      practitioner. The proportion of individuals having contact with specialist care 
      ranged from 39.3% (pain during intercourse) to 47.8% (bleeding during 
      intercourse). Individuals with higher educational level had significantly higher 
      odds of contact with a specialist (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Educational level influences contact with specialist care among patients with 
      gynecological cancer alarm symptoms. Future studies should investigate 
      inequalities in access to the secondary healthcare system.
