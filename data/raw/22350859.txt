AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the most effective 
      content of pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) and whether educational 
      attainment moderates these effects. METHODS: Field experiments were conducted 
      with 529 adult smokers and 530 young adults (258 nonsmokers; 271 smokers). 
      Participants reported responses to different pictorial HWLs printed on cigarette 
      packages. One experiment involved manipulating textual form (testimonial 
      narrative vs. didactic) and the other involved manipulating image type (diseased 
      organs vs. human suffering). RESULTS: Tests of mean ratings and rankings 
      indicated that pictorial HWLs with didactic textual forms had equivalent or 
      significantly higher credibility, relevance, and impact than pictorial HWLs with 
      testimonial forms. Results from mixed-effects models confirmed these results. 
      However, responses differed by participant educational attainment: didactic forms 
      were consistently rated higher than testimonials among participants with higher 
      education, whereas the difference between didactic and testimonial narrative 
      forms was weaker or not statistically significant among participants with lower 
      education. In the second experiment, with textual content held constant, greater 
      credibility, relevance, and impact was found for graphic imagery of diseased 
      organs than imagery of human suffering. CONCLUSIONS: Pictorial HWLs with didactic 
      textual forms seem to work better than those with testimonial narratives. Future 
      research should determine which pictorial HWL content has the greatest real-world 
      impact among consumers from disadvantaged groups, including assessment of how HWL 
      content should change to maintain its impact as tobacco control environments 
      strengthen and consumer awareness of smoking-related risks increases.
