AB  - CONTEXT: Adults with GH deficiency (GHD) have a decreased life expectancy. The 
      effect of GH treatment on mortality remains to be established. OBJECTIVE: This 
      nationwide cohort study investigates the effect of GH treatment on all-cause and 
      cause-specific mortality and analyzes patient characteristics influencing 
      mortality in GHD adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients in the Dutch 
      National Registry of Growth Hormone Treatment in Adults were retrospectively 
      monitored (1985-2009) and subdivided into treatment (n = 2229), primary 
      (untreated, n = 109), and secondary control (partly treated, n = 356) groups. 
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for 
      all-cause, malignancy, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Expected 
      mortality was obtained from cause, sex, calendar year, and age-specific death 
      rates from national death and population counts. RESULTS: In the treatment group, 
      95 patients died compared to 74.6 expected [SMR 1.27 (95% confidence interval, 
      1.04-1.56)]. Mortality was higher in women than in men. After exclusion of 
      high-risk patients, the SMR for CVD mortality remained increased in women. 
      Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated. In the control groups mortality 
      was not different from the background population. Univariate analyses 
      demonstrated sex, GHD onset, age, and underlying diagnosis as influencing 
      factors. CONCLUSIONS: GHD men receiving GH treatment have a mortality rate not 
      different from the background population. In women, after exclusion of high-risk 
      patients, mortality was not different from the background population except for 
      CVD. Mortality due to malignancies was not elevated in adults receiving GH 
      treatment. Next to gender, the heterogeneous etiology is of influence on 
      mortality in GHD adults with GH treatment.
