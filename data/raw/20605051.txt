      care delivery?

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Reimbursement based on the total care of a patient during an acute 
      episode of illness is believed to stimulate management and clinicians to reduce 
      quality problems like waiting times and poor coordination of care delivery. 
      Although many studies already show that this kind of case-mix based reimbursement 
      leads to more efficiency, it remains unclear whether care coordination improved 
      as well. This study aims to explore whether case-mix based reimbursement 
      stimulates development of care coordination by the use of care programmes, and a 
      process-oriented way of working. METHODS: Data for this study were gathered 
      during the winter of 2007/2008 in a survey involving all Dutch hospitals. 
      Descriptive and structural equation modelling (SEM) analyses were conducted. 
      RESULTS: SEM reveals that adoption of the case-mix reimbursement within 
      hospitals' budgeting processes stimulates hospitals to establish care programmes 
      by the use of process-oriented performance measures. However, the implementation 
      of care programmes is not (yet) accompanied by a change in focus from function 
      (the delivery of independent care activities) to process (the delivery of care 
      activities as being connected to a chain of interdependent care activities). 
      CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that hospital management can stimulate the 
      development of care programmes by the adoption of case-mix reimbursement within 
      hospitals' budgeting processes. Future research is recommended to confirm this 
      finding and to determine whether the establishment of care programmes will in 
      time indeed lead to a more process-oriented view of professionals.
