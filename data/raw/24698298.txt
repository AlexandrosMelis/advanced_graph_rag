AB  - PURPOSE: To assess pain intensity with and without subcutaneous local anesthesia 
      prior to intraarticular administration of contrast medium for magnetic resonance 
      arthrography (MRa) of the shoulder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center 
      study was conducted after an IRB waiver of authorization, between January 2010 
      and December 2012. All patients provided written, informed consent for the 
      procedure. Our prospectively populated institutional database was searched, based 
      on our inclusion criteria. There were 249 outpatients (178 men and 71 women; mean 
      age, 44.4 years +/- 14.6; range, 15-79) who underwent MRa and were enrolled in this 
      study. Patients were excluded if they had received surgery of the shoulder before 
      MRa, had undergone repeated MRa of the same shoulder, and/or had undergone MRa of 
      both shoulders on the same day. Patients were randomly assigned into one of three 
      groups. Patients in group A (n=61) received skin infiltration with local 
      anesthesia. Patients in control group B (n=92) and group C (n=96) did not receive 
      local anesthesia. Pain levels were immediately assessed after the injection for 
      MRa using a horizontal visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 to 10. To 
      compare the pain scores of the three groups for male and female patients, a 
      two-way analysis of variance was used. A p-value equal to or less than 0.05 was 
      considered to indicate a significant result. RESULTS: Patients who received local 
      anesthesia (group A) showed a mean pain level on the VAS of 2.6 +/- 2.3. In 
      patients who did not receive local anesthetics (groups B and C), a mean pain 
      level on the VAS of 2.6 +/- 2.2 and 2.7 +/- 2.4 were detected, respectively. Between 
      the three groups, no statistically significant difference in pain intensity was 
      detected (p=.960). There were significant differences in subjective pain 
      perception between men and women (p=.009). Moreover, the sex difference in all 
      three groups was equal (p=.934). CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia is not required to 
      lower a patient's pain intensity when applying intra-articular contrast media for 
      MR arthrography of the shoulder. This could result in reduced costs and a reduced 
      risk of adverse reactions, without an impact on patient comfort.
