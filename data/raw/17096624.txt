PG  - 675-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine patterns of knowledge and attitudes among adults aged > 65 
      years unvaccinated for influenza. METHODS: Surveyed Medicare beneficiaries in 5 
      areas; clustered unvaccinated seniors by their immunization related knowledge and 
      attitudes. RESULTS: Identified 4 clusters: Potentials (45%) would receive 
      influenza vaccine to prevent disease; Fearful Uninformeds (9%) were unsure if 
      influenza vaccine causes illness; Doubters (27%) were unsure if vaccine is 
      efficacious; Misinformeds (19%) believed influenza vaccine causes illness. More 
      Potentials (75%) and Misinformeds (70%) ever received influenza vaccine than did 
      Fearful Uninformeds (18%) and Doubters (29%). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that 
      cluster analyses may be useful in identifying groups for targeted health 
      messages.
