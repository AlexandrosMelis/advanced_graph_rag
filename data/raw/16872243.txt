TI  - Can decisional algorithms replace global introspection in the individual 
      causality assessment of spontaneously reported ADRs?
PG  - 697-702
AB  - AIM: The usefulness of algorithms for assessing the causality of suspected 
      adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has yet to be established and, since the validation 
      of causality algorithms depends upon their sensitivity and specificity, our study 
      was carried out to evaluate these measures. METHOD: In this study, an expert 
      panel assessed causality of adverse reports by using the WHO global introspection 
      (GI) method. The same reports were independently assessed using 15 published 
      algorithms. The causality assessment level 'possible' was considered the lower 
      limit for a report to be considered to be drug related. For a given algorithm, 
      sensitivity was determined by the proportion of reports simultaneously classified 
      as drug related by the algorithm and the GI method. Specificity was measured as 
      the proportion of reports simultaneously considered non-drug related. The 
      analysis was performed for the total sample and within serious or unexpected 
      events. RESULTS: Five hundred adverse reports were studied. Algorithms presented 
      high rates of sensitivity (average of 93%, positive predictive value of 89%) and 
      low rates of specificity (average of 7%, negative predictive value of 31%). 
      CONCLUSION: Decisional algorithms are sensitive methods for the detection of 
      ADRs, but they present poor specificity. A reference method was not identified. 
      Algorithms do not replace GI and are not definite alternatives in the individual 
      causality assessment of suspected ADRs.
