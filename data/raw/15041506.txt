TI  - Is fear of anaphylactic shock discouraging surgeons from more widely adopting 
      percutaneous and laparoscopic techniques in the treatment of liver hydatid cyst?
PG  - 533-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sources of reports about laparoscopic and percutaneous treatment of 
      liver hydatid cysts are limited to just a few countries. To address the reason 
      behind this, we carried out a survey of 30 surgeons in northern Jordan. METHODS: 
      A questionnaire was distributed to collect data regarding the surgical technique 
      preferred by each surgeon. Further information was collected from those not 
      adopting minimal-access techniques to determine their reasons for not doing so. 
      RESULTS: Only 3 surgeons (10%) considered laparoscopy as the first line of 
      treatment. Of the 27 surgeons who did not consider percutaneous or laparoscopic 
      treatment, fear of anaphylaxis and/or dissemination was the main reason given by 
      21 surgeons (78%) for not using minimal access techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      seemingly exaggerated traditional fear of anaphylaxis seems to discourage 
      surgeons from more widely adopting minimal access techniques for the treatment of 
      hydatid cyst.
