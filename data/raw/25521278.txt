AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identifying eating behaviors which contribute to excess weight gain 
      will inform obesity prevention strategies. A tendency to clear one's plate when 
      eating may be a risk factor for obesity in an environment where food is 
      plentiful. Whether plate clearing is associated with increased body weight in a 
      cohort of US participants was examined. METHODS: Nine hundred and ninety-three US 
      adults (60% male, 80% American European, mean age=31 years) completed self-report 
      measures of habitual plate clearing together with behavioral and demographic 
      characteristics known to be associated with obesity. RESULTS: Plate clearing 
      tendencies were positively associated with BMI and remained so after accounting 
      for a large number of other demographic and behavioral predictors of BMI in 
      analyses (beta=0.18, 95% CIs=0.07, 0.29, P<0.001); an increased tendency to plate 
      clear was associated with a significantly higher body weight. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      tendency to clear one's plate when eating is associated with increased body 
      weight and may constitute a risk factor for weight gain.
