TI  - Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent?
PG  - 952-6
AB  - AIM: To ascertain whether recovery of visual function in amblyopic eyes is likely 
      to occur when the fellow eye is lost as a result of age related macular 
      degeneration. METHODS: The records of 465 patients with an established diagnosis 
      of age related macular degeneration who had attended a specialist macular clinic 
      between 1990 and 1998 were scrutinised. A full clinical examination and 
      standardised refraction had been carried out in 189 of these cases on a minimum 
      of two occasions. Cases were looked for where an improvement of one or more lines 
      of either distance or near acuity was recorded in the eye unaffected by macular 
      disease. In each one of these cases the improvement in visual acuity could not be 
      attributed to treatment of other existing pathology. RESULTS: 12 such cases were 
      detected. In nine of these the eye showing improvement of acuity had a history of 
      amblyopia. The mean improvement in distance and near acuity in amblyopic eyes by 
      12 months was 3.3 and 1.9 lines logMAR respectively. The improvement in acuity 
      generally occurred between 1 and 12 months from baseline and remained stable over 
      the period of follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Older people with a history of amblyopia 
      who develop visual loss in the previously normal eye can experience recovery of 
      visual function in the amblyopic eye over a period of time. This recovery in 
      visual function occurs in the wake of visual loss in the fellow eye and the 
      improvement appears to be sustained.
