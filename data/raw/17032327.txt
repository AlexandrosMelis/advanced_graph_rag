TI  - Do supervised colorectal trainees differ from consultants in terms of quality of 
      TME surgery?
PG  - 790-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The quality of surgical excision is held to be a major determinant of 
      outcome following surgery for rectal cancer. Macroscopic examination of the 
      excised mesorectum allows for reproducible assessment of the quality of surgery. 
      We aimed to determine whether quality of excision undertaken by colorectal 
      trainees under supervision was comparable with that performed by consultants, as 
      measured using mesorectal grades. METHOD: A total of 130 consecutive patients 
      undergoing potentially curative resection for primary adenocarcinoma of the 
      rectum in our centre from 2001 to 2003 were included in the study. The 
      pathologists graded the excised mesorectum according to staged classification 
      proposed by Quirke. The outcome (quality of mesorectal excision and secondary 
      outcomes including local recurrence and overall recurrence) of operations 
      performed by consultants was compared with that of trainees. Statistical 
      significance was tested using Pearson chi(2) test. RESULTS: Eighty-nine 
      operations were performed by consultants and 41 by senior colorectal trainees 
      with consultant supervision. Forty-four patients (49%) had good mesorectum when 
      operated by consultants in comparison with 17 (41.5%) by the trainees. There was 
      no statistically significant difference (P = 0.717) between the two groups in 
      terms of quality of mesorectum excised after potentially curative resection. 
      Furthermore, there were seven local recurrences in patients operated by 
      consultants (7.8%) when compared with four in the trainee group (9.5%) and once 
      again there was no statistical significance between the two groups (P = 0.719). 
      CONCLUSION: We conclude that the quality of rectal cancer excision, as defined by 
      mesorectal grades, achieved by supervised colorectal trainees is comparable with 
      that achieved by consultants.
