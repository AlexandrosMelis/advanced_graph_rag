TI  - Counter sampling combined with medical provider education: do they alter 
      prescribing behavior?
PG  - 636-42
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe if medical providers alter their prescribing patterns of 
      three relatively expensive categories of medications provided as samples by 
      manufacturers (focus medications) when they receive additional education from 
      pharmacists concerning the appropriate use of lower cost alternatives (counter 
      samples) that are made available to dispense. DESIGN: Pretest, post-test with a 
      control group. SETTING: Two rural, private care clinics in southeastern Idaho 
      providing immediate care services. PARTICIPANTS: Eight medical providers at a 
      clinic where interventions were employed (active intervention group) and seven 
      medical providers in a clinic where no interventions occurred (control group). 
      INTERVENTIONS: Medical providers in the active intervention group had: 1) 
      education from pharmacists concerning the appropriate use of lower-cost 
      alternatives compared with expensive focus medications 2) counter samples and 
      patient sample handouts available to dispense to patients at their own 
      discretion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The percentage of the total yearly 
      prescriptions for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antihistamines, 
      and acid-relief medications that consisted of focus-COX-2 NSAIDs, nonsedating 
      antihistamines, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), respectively. RESULTS: The 
      prescribing behavior of medical providers in the active intervention and control 
      groups were significantly different at baseline in all three categories of focus 
      medications. This suggested that the results should focus on changes across the 
      two years of the study within the intervention and control groups rather than 
      across the two groups. Medical providers in the intervention group significantly 
      decreased the use of COX-2 NSAID prescriptions relative to total NSAID 
      prescriptions following active intervention (38.9% in year 1 versus 23.7% in year 
      2, P < 0.05). Over the same two time periods, a nonstatistically significant 
      decrease in COX-2 NSAID prescribing was seen at the control site (67.5% versus 
      62%, P > 0.05). Education and counter sampling did not stop medical providers 
      from significantly increasing the total yearly prescriptions for antihistamines 
      and acid-relief medications that consisted of focus-nonsedating antihistamines 
      (86.7% versus 93.1%, P < 0.05) and PPIs (68.9% versus 86.2%, P < 0.05). 
      Statistically significant increases in the prescribing of focus-nonsedating 
      antihistamines (77.9% versus 98.3%, P < 0.05) and PPIs (77.5% versus 91.4%, P < 
      0.05) were also observed in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Education by 
      pharmacists, combined with access to counter samples, may or may not have an 
      effect on medical provider prescribing, depending on the category of medication 
      targeted for cost control.
