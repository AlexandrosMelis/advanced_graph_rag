AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is often accompanied by an abnormal 
      motor performance. However, it has not been clarified yet whether these 
      deviations also occur during motor tasks not involving the back and whether the 
      performance is influenced by pain and pain-related cognitions. Therefore, the aim 
      of the present study is to get insight in the contribution of both pain 
      experience and pain-related cognitions to general motor task performance in CLBP. 
      METHODS: 13 CLBP patients and 15 healthy subjects performed a hand-function task 
      in three conditions: sitting, lying prone (lying) and lying prone without trunk 
      support (provoking). The last condition was assumed to provoke pain-related 
      cognitions, which was considered successful when a patients' pain expectancy on a 
      numeric rating scale was at least 1 point higher than actual pain experienced. 
      Subjects' performance was expressed in reaction time and movement time. Repeated 
      measures analysis of variance was performed to detect main effect for group and 
      condition. Special interest was given to group*condition interaction, since 
      significant interaction would indicate that patients and healthy subjects 
      performed differently throughout the three conditions. RESULTS: Patients were 
      slower throughout all conditions compared to healthy subjects. With respect to 
      the provoking condition, patients showed deteriorated performance compared to 
      lying while healthy subjects' performance remained equal between these two 
      conditions. Further analysis of patients' data showed that provocation was 
      successful in 54% of the patients. Especially this group showed deteriorated 
      performance in the provoking condition. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that CLBP 
      patients in general have worse motor task performance compared to healthy 
      subjects and that provoking pain-related cognitions further worsened performance.
