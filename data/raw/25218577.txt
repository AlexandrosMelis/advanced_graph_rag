TI  - Preservation of the PCL when performing cruciate-retaining TKA: Is the tibial 
      tuberosity a reliable predictor of the PCL footprint location?

AB  - PURPOSE: Reconstruction of the joint line is crucial in total knee arthroplasty 
      (TKA). A routine height of tibial cut to maintain the natural joint line may 
      compromise the preservation of the PCL. Since the PCL footprint is not accessible 
      prior to tibial osteotomy, it seems beneficial to identify a reliable 
      extraarticular anatomic landmark for predicting the PCL footprint and being 
      visible within standard TKA approach. The fibula head predicts reliably the 
      location of PCL footprint; however, it is not accessible during TKA. The aim of 
      this study now was to analyze whether the tibial tuberosity can serve as a 
      reliable referencing landmark to estimate the PCL footprint height prior to 
      tibial cut. METHODS: The first consecutive case series included 216 CR TKA. 
      Standing postoperative lateral view radiographs were utilized to measure the 
      vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and tibial osteotomy plane. In the 
      second case series, 223 knee MRIs were consecutively analyzed to measure the 
      vertical distance between tibial tuberosity and PCL footprint. The probability of 
      partial or total PCL removal was calculated for different vertical distances 
      between tibial tuberosity and tibial cutting surface. RESULTS: The vertical 
      distance between the tibial tuberosity and tibial cut averaged 24.7 +/- 4 mm. The 
      average vertical distance from tibial tuberosity to proximal and to distal PCL 
      footprint was found to be 22 +/- 4.4 and 16 +/- 4.4 mm, respectively. Five knees were 
      considered at 50% risk of an entire PCL removal after CR TKA. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Current surgical techniques of tibial preparation may result in partial or total 
      PCL damage. Tibial tuberosity is a useful anatomical landmark to locate the PCL 
      footprint and to predict the probability of its detachment pre-, intra-, and 
      postoperatively. This knowledge might be useful to predict and avoid instability, 
      consecutive pain, and dissatisfaction after TKA related to PCL insufficiency.
