AB  - BACKGROUND: The ImmunoCAP ISAC 112 is a fluoro-immunoassay that allows detection 
      of specific IgE to 112 molecular components from 51 allergenic sources. We 
      studied the reliability of this technique intra- and inter- assay, as well as 
      inter-batch- and inter-laboratory-assay. METHODS: Twenty samples were studied, 
      nineteen sera from polysensitized allergic patients, and the technique calibrator 
      provided by the manufacturer (CTR02). We measured the sIgE from CTR02 and three 
      patients' sera ten times in the same and in different assays. Furthermore, all 
      samples were tested in two laboratories and with two batches of ISAC kit. To 
      evaluate the accuracy of ISAC 112, we contrasted the determinations of CTR02 
      calibrator with their expected values by T Student test. To analyse the 
      precision, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) of the 15 allergens 
      that generate the calibration curve, and to analyse the repeatability and the 
      reproducibility, we calculated the intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC) to 
      each allergen. RESULTS: The results obtained for CTR02 were similar to those 
      expected in 7 of 15 allergens that generate the calibration curve, whereas in 8 
      allergens the results showed significant differences. The mean CV obtained in the 
      CTR02 determinations was of 9.4%, and the variability of sera from patients was 
      of 22.9%. The agreement in the intra- and inter-assay analysis was very good to 
      94 allergens and good to one. In the inter-batch analyse, we obtained a very good 
      agreement to 82 allergens, good to 14, moderate to 5 allergens, poor to one, and 
      bad to 1 allergen. In the inter-laboratory analyse, we obtained a very good 
      agreement to 73 allergens, good to 22, moderate to 6 and poor to two allergens. 
      CONCLUSION: The allergen microarray immunoassay, ISAC 112, is a repeatable and 
      reproducible in vitro diagnostic tool for determination of sIgE beyond the own 
      laboratory.
