TI  - Is the type of remission after a major depressive episode an important risk 
      factor to relapses in a 4-year follow up?
PG  - 291-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Rates of relapse and predictive relapse factors were studied over 
      more than 4 years in a sample of Spanish outpatients with DSM-III-R criteria for 
      unipolar major depressive episode. METHODS: A final sample of 139 outpatient was 
      followed monthly in a naturalistic study. The Structured Clinical Interview for 
      DSM-III-R was used. Phases of evolution were recorded using the Hamilton 
      Depression Rating Scale, applying the Frank criteria. Survival analysis, 
      Kaplan-Meier product limit and proportional hazards models were used. RESULTS: A 
      higher rate of relapses was observed in the partial remission group (91.4%) 
      compared to the complete remission one (51.3%). The four factors with predictive 
      relapse value were: "partial remission versus complete remission", "the intensity 
      of clinical symptoms", "the age" and "the number of previous depressive 
      episodes". The existence of partial remission was the most powerful predictive 
      factor. LIMITATIONS: The decreasing sample size during the follow-up and the 
      difficulty in warranting the treatment compliance. CONCLUSIONS: At medium term, 
      relapse rates for a major depressive episode are high. Partial remission after a 
      depressive episode seems to be an important predictive factor for relapses in a 
      4-year follow-up. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Not reaching complete remission is a strong 
      risk factor for relapses in a 4-year follow up study.
