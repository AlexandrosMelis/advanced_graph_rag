TI  - Does aerobic fitness influence microvascular function in healthy adults at risk 
      of developing Type 2 diabetes?
PG  - 483-9
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether aerobic fitness is associated with skin microvascular 
      function in healthy adults with an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. 
      METHODS: Twenty-seven healthy normal glucose-tolerant humans with either a 
      previous diagnosis of gestational diabetes or having two parents with Type 2 
      diabetes and 27 healthy adults who had no history of diabetes were recruited. 
      Maximal oxygen uptake was assessed using an incremental exercise test to 
      exhaustion. Skin microvascular function was assessed using laser Doppler 
      techniques as the maximum skin hyperaemic response to a thermal stimulus (maximum 
      hyperaemia) and the forearm skin blood flow response to the iontophoretic 
      application of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside. RESULTS: Maximal 
      oxygen uptake was not significantly different in the 'at-risk' group compared 
      with healthy controls. Maximum hyperaemia was reduced in those 'at risk' (1.29 
      +/- 0.30 vs. 1.46 +/- 0.33 V, P = 0.047); however, the peak response to 
      acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside did not differ in the two groups. A 
      significant positive correlation was demonstrated between maximal oxygen uptake 
      and maximum hyperaemia (r = 0.52, P = 0.006 l/min and r = 0.60, P = 0.001 
      ml/kg/min) and peak ACh response (r = 0.40, P = 0.04 l/min and r = 0.47, P = 
      0.013 ml/kg/min) in the 'at-risk' group when expressed in absolute (l/min) or 
      body mass-related (ml/kg/min) terms. No significant correlations were found in 
      the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this 'at-risk' group with skin microvascular 
      dysfunction maximal oxygen uptake was not reduced compared with healthy controls. 
      However, in the 'at-risk' group alone, individuals with higher levels of aerobic 
      fitness also had better microvascular and endothelial responsiveness.
