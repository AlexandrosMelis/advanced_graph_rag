TI  - Does a dedicated discharge coordinator improve the quality of hospital discharge?
PG  - 89-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the role of a discharge coordinator 
      whose sole responsibility was to plan and coordinate the discharge of patients 
      from medical wards. DESIGN: An intervention study in which the quality of 
      discharge planning was assessed before and after the introduction of a discharge 
      coordinator. Patients were interviewed on the ward before discharge and seven to 
      10 days after being discharged home. SETTING: The three medical wards at the 
      Homerton Hospital in Hackney, East London. PATIENTS: 600 randomly sampled adult 
      patients admitted to the medical wards of the study hospital, who were resident 
      in the district (but not in institutions), were under the care of physicians 
      (excluding psychiatry), and were discharged home from one of the medical wards. 
      The sampling was conducted in three study phases, over 18 months. INTERVENTIONS: 
      Phase I comprised base line data collection; in phase II data were collected 
      after the introduction of the district discharge planning policy and a discharge 
      form (checklist) for all patients; in phase III data were collected after the 
      introduction of the discharge coordinator. MAIN MEASURES: The quality and out 
      come of discharge planning. Readmission rates, duration of stay, appropriateness 
      of days of care, patients' health and satisfaction, problems after discharge, and 
      receipt of services. RESULTS: The discharge coordinator resulted in an improved 
      discharge planning process, and there was a reduction in problems experienced by 
      patients after discharge, and in perceived need for medical and healthcare 
      services. There was no evidence that the discharge coordinator resulted in a more 
      timely or effective provision of community services after discharge, or that the 
      appropriateness or efficiency of bed use was improved. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      introduction of a discharge coordinator improved the quality of discharge 
      planning, but at additional cost.
