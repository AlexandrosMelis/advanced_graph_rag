AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Current evidence suggests that neck pain is negatively 
      associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, these studies 
      are cross-sectional and do not inform the association between neck pain and 
      future HRQoL. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      association between increasing grades of neck pain severity and HRQoL 6 months 
      later. In addition, this longitudinal study examines the crude association 
      between the course of neck pain and HRQoL. STUDY DESIGN: This is a 
      population-based cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Eleven hundred randomly sampled 
      Saskatchewan adults were included. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were the 
      mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of the 
      Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. METHODS: We formed a cohort of 1,100 
      randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain 
      Questionnaire to measure neck pain and its related disability. The SF-36 
      questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL 6 months later. 
      Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between 
      graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for confounding. Analysis of 
      variance and t tests were used to measure the crude association among four 
      possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The neck pain trajectories 
      over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck pain, worsening neck 
      pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of variance was used to examine 
      changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores among the four neck pain 
      trajectory groups. RESULTS: The 6-month follow-up rate was 74.9%. We found an 
      exposure-response relationship between neck pain and physical HRQoL after 
      adjusting for age, education, arthritis, low back pain, and depressive 
      symptomatology. Compared with participants without neck pain at baseline, those 
      with mild (beta=-1.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]=-2.83, -0.24), intense (beta=-3.60, 
      95% CI=-5.76, -1.44), or disabling (beta=-8.55, 95% CI=-11.68, -5.42) neck pain had 
      worse physical HRQoL 6 months later. We did not find an association between neck 
      pain and mental HRQoL. A worsening course of neck pain and persistent neck pain 
      were associated with worse physical HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: We found that neck pain 
      was negatively associated with physical but not mental HRQoL. Our analysis 
      suggests that neck pain may be a contributor of future poor physical HRQoL in the 
      population. Raising awareness of the possible future impact of neck pain on 
      physical HRQoL is important for health-care providers and policy makers with 
      respect to the management of neck pain in populations.
