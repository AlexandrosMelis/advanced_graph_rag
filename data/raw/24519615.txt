AB  - PURPOSE: In vivo comparative gap measurements were performed in three different 
      patella positions (reduced, subluxated and everted) using 
      offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system. METHODS: Prospectively, 50 knees 
      were operated by total knee arthroplasty using a navigation-assisted 
      gap-balancing technique. The offset-type-force-controlled-spreader-system was 
      used for gap measurements. This commercially available instrument allows 
      controllable tension in patella-reduced position. The mediolateral gaps of knee 
      extension (0 degrees ) and flexion (90 degrees ) angle were recorded in three different patella 
      positions; reduced, subluxated and everted. Any gap differences of more than 3 mm 
      were considered as a meaningful difference. Correlation between the difference 
      with the demographic data, preoperative radiologic alignment and intraoperative 
      data was analysed. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Pearson's correlation test 
      were used. RESULTS: The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both 
      in knee extension and flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction 
      position. The amount of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion 
      position. Statistically significant difference was observed for the lateral gap 
      of patella eversion compared to gap of patella reduction in knee flexion position 
      (p < 0.05). There were notable cases of variability in knee flexion position. 
      Significant portion of 12 (24 %) knees of patella subluxation and 33 (66 %) knees 
      of patella evertion demonstrated either increased or decreased gaps in knee 
      flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. CONCLUSION: 
      The gaps in patella eversion demonstrated smaller gaps both in knee extension and 
      flexion position compared to the gaps of patella reduction position. The amount 
      of decreased gaps was more definite in knee flexion position. Therefore, the 
      intraoperative patellar positioning has influence on the measurement of the joint 
      gap. Keeping the patella in reduced position is important during gap balancing.
