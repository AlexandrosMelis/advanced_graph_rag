AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined changes in the use of complementary and 
      alternative medicine (CAM) therapies by U.S. adults aged 18 years or older with 
      chronic disease-related functional limitations between 2002 and 2007. DESIGN: The 
      study was a cross-sectional survey. SETTING/LOCATION: The study was conducted in 
      the United States. SUBJECTS: The study comprised adults aged 18 years or older 
      with chronic disease-related functional limitations. METHODS: Data were obtained 
      from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use 
      of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age 
      adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population. RESULTS: The unadjusted and 
      age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use (22 therapies comparable between 
      both survey years) was higher in 2007 than in 2002 (30.6% versus 26.9%, p<0.001 
      and 34.4% versus 30.6%, p<0.001, respectively). Adults with functional 
      limitations that included changing and maintaining body position experienced a 
      significant increase in CAM use between 2002 and 2007 (31.1%-35.0%, p<0.01). The 
      use of deep breathing exercises was the most prevalent CAM therapy in both 2002 
      and 2007 and increased significantly during this period (from 17.9% to 19.9%, 
      p<0.05). The use of meditation, massage, and yoga also increased significantly 
      from 2002 and 2007 (11.0%-13.5%, p<0.01; 7.0%-10.9%, p<0.0001; and 5.1% to 6.6%, 
      p<0.05, respectively), while the use of the Atkins diet decreased (2.2%- 1.4%, 
      p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional 
      limitations, the overall increase in CAM use from 2002 to 2007 was significant, 
      particularly among those with changing and maintaining body position limitations.
