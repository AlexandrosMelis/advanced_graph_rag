      cell death?

AB  - BACKGROUND: Programmed cell death (PCD) is the regulated death of cells within an 
      organism. The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in 
      its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of 
      longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at 
      the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five 
      cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been 
      recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants. 
      RESULTS: The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during 
      developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole 
      within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based 
      on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early 
      stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves 
      were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. 
      Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on 
      characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (DeltaPsim). A 
      TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. 
      Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell 
      imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore 
      (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A 
      (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a 
      significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that 
      displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace 
      plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles 
      during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report 
      of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring 
      structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first 
      time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. 
      Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early 
      role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.
